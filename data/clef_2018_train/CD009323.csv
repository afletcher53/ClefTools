CD009323,0,22965511,0,Small bowel leiomyosarcoma: a case report and literature review.,"Small bowel neoplasms are very uncommon, especially leiomyosarcoma of the small bowel. Therefore, there is often a delay before small bowel leiomyosarcoma is diagnosed and treatment is started. A 60-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to our hospital with progressive melena. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal the cause of the melena, but magnetic resonance imaging showed a jejunal tumor. After laparoscopic resection, the tumor appeared to be a grade 2 leiomyosarcoma. Small bowel neoplasms can be accurately detected by magnetic resonance enterography or wireless capsule endoscopy. Treatment almost always consists of resection of the primary tumor and its metastases. The role of chemo- and radiotherapy is not yet clear and prognosis remains very poor, with low five-year survival rates."

CD009323,0,22958804,0,Small bowel adenocarcinoma. Two case reports.,"Introduction. Small bowel adenocarcinoma is a rare tumor, with a still not well studied tumorigenesis process, and non-specific symptoms that cause a delay in the diagnosis and consequently a worst outcome for the patient. Videocapsule endoscopy (VCE) and double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) have revolutionized the diagnosis and management of patients with small bowel diseases. Surgery is the treatment of choice when feasible, while the chemotherapeutic approach is still not well standardized. Case reports. Two cases in 2 months (two women 52 and 72-yr-old) of primary bowel adenocarcinoma is reported. The site of the tumor was in jejunum, instead of the most common site in duodenum. The patients underwent DBE with biopsy and ink mark. Laparoscopic-assisted bowel segmental resection was performed. The pathologic diagnosis was primary jejunum adenocarcinoma. No post-operative mortality or significant morbidities were noted. Conclusion. The combination of DBE and laparocopic-assisted bowel surgery represents an ideal diagnostic and therapeutic method."

CD009323,0,22955895,0,Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with intracorporeal handsewn Billroth-I anastomosis (ICHSA).,"The number of cases of laparoscopic surgery has been increasing. Lymph node dissection has been standardized, and the enlarged view provided by laparoscopes allows for the procedure to be performed successfully entirely within the abdominal cavity, but many cases of reconstruction using the Billroth-I method are performed under direct vision through a small incision. In this study, by placing an anchor thread on a suture line on the lesser curvature of the stomach, we simplified the procedure for handsewn anastomosis and safely performed gastroduodenal anastomosis at low cost to obtain good results."

Management has been classified as surgical (conventional and laparoscopic) and nonsurgical (endoscopic and radiologic). The aim of this report is to describe our initial experience in the management of a pancreatic pseudocyst by means of laparoscopic posterior cyst-gastrostomy anastomosis, performed at the Pancreas Clinic of the Hospital General ""Dr. Manuel Gea González"" in Mexico City. New techniques and instrumentation have contributed to the relatively recent development of laparoscopic pancreatic surgery. Our technique has practical advantages that have been confirmed by other authors, such as simple hemostasis, a wide viewing angle enabling adequate necrosectomy, anastomosis that does not require the use of staples, and the possibility of resolving other associated intra-abdominal pathologies, as in this case."

Furthermore, due to the relative rarity of these tumors when compared to hepatocellular carcinoma, only a few reports have focused on short- and long-term results."
CD009323,0,22925292,0,"Diagnostic usefulness of precise examinations with intraductal ultrasonography, peroral cholangioscopy and laparoscopy of immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing cholangitis.","Herein, a case of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related sclerosing cholangitis is reported. IgG4 was diagnosed based on observations from peroral cholangioscopy and laparoscopy, and these methods are proposed for definitive and precise diagnosis of this disease. A 76-year-old male patient with inguinal Paget's disease had intrahepatic bile duct dilatations detected with computed tomography at his periodic check-up. Magnetic resonance cholangiography showed stenosis of the upper common bile duct and poststenotic dilatation of left intrahepatic bile ducts. The portal tract and bilateral intrahepatic bile ducts were surrounded by a low-density area, facing a tumor-like lesion at segment 2. Cytological examinations of the stenotic and dilated lesions revealed no cellular atypia. Histological examination of the tumor showed normal liver tissue with infiltration of lymphocytes, indicating an inflammatory pseudotumor. Peroral cholangioscopy excluded the possibility of biliary cancer and indicated that the stenotic legion was of submucosal, not mucosal, origin. Laparoscopic observations showed discoloration with wide yellowish-white lobular markings and wide depressed lesions at segments 2 and 7. Liver histology showed mild cholangitis with infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells around the bile ducts. Serum IgG4 levels were elevated. From these findings, the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis. After treatment with prednisolone, blood liver enzymes and IgG4 rapidly normalized, bile duct dilatations improved, and the hepatic pseudotumor disappeared. The cholangitis did not recur. In this case, biliary cancer was ruled out by observation with peroral cholangioscopy, and the spread of cholangitis in the liver periphery was verified with laparoscopy; this information could not be obtained with other modalities."

Proximal migration of the stent into the duct occurs in 2% to 5% of cases, often resulting in pancreatitis. Although technically challenging, proximally migrated pancreatic stents can usually be removed endoscopically. Little has been written about surgical management of irretrievable stents, and no reports of laparoscopic approaches were found."

We conducted this study to evaluate the feasibility, safety, advantages and complications of single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy using the conventional laparoscopic instruments."
CD009323,0,22889003,0,"Optical endomicroscopy and the road to real-time, in vivo pathology: present and future.","Epithelial cancers account for substantial mortality and are an important public health concern. With the need for earlier detection and treatment of these malignancies, the ability to accurately detect precancerous lesions has an increasingly important role in controlling cancer incidence and mortality. New optical technologies are capable of identifying early pathology in tissues or organs in which cancer is known to develop through stages of dysplasia, including the esophagus, colon, pancreas, liver, bladder, and cervix. These diagnostic imaging advances, together as a field known as optical endomicroscopy, are based on confocal microscopy, spectroscopy-based imaging, and optical coherence tomography (OCT), and function as ""optical biopsies,"" enabling tissue pathology to be imaged in situ and in real time without the need to excise and process specimens as in conventional biopsy and histopathology. Optical biopsy techniques can acquire high-resolution, cross-sectional images of tissue structure on the micron scale through the use of endoscopes, catheters, laparoscopes, and needles. Since the inception of these technologies, dramatic technological advances in accuracy, speed, and functionality have been realized. The current paradigm of optical biopsy, or single-area, point-based images, is slowly shifting to more comprehensive microscopy of larger tracts of mucosa. With the development of Fourier-domain OCT, also known as optical frequency domain imaging or, more recently, volumetric laser endomicroscopy, comprehensive surveillance of the entire distal esophagus is now achievable at speeds that were not possible with conventional OCT technologies. Optical diagnostic technologies are emerging as clinically useful tools with the potential to set a new standard for real-time diagnosis. New imaging techniques enable visualization of high-resolution, cross-sectional images and offer the opportunity to guide biopsy, allowing maximal diagnostic yields and appropriate staging without the limitations and risks inherent with current random biopsy protocols. However, the ability of these techniques to achieve widespread adoption in clinical practice depends on future research designed to improve accuracy and allow real-time data transmission and storage, thereby linking pathology to the treating physician. These imaging advances are expected to eventually offer a see-and-treat paradigm, leading to improved patient care and potential cost reduction."

CD009323,0,22878576,0,[Modern diagnostics and stage-oriented surgery: therapy of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction].,"The basis for decision-making about an individualized surgical treatment of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction is tumor staging and exact evaluation of the topography of the tumor in the small junctional area. The diagnostics mainly comprise endoscopy, biopsy, endosonography, computed tomography and partially diagnostic laparoscopy. This results in a clinical TNM staging and an evaluation according to the AEG classification from oral to aboral in type I (esophagus), type II (cardia) and type III (subcardia). Endoscopic resection is only appropriate for the infrequent mucosal carcinomas whereas the majority of the junctional carcinomas are treated by surgical resection. This is combined with neoadjuvant treatment in case of T3 or resectable T4 carcinomas. A type I carcinoma is removed by radical transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy with high intrathoracic esophagogastrostomy after gastric pull-up. In case of type II or III carcinomas, a transhiatal extended gastrectomy including distal esophageal resection is performed with reconstruction by Roux en Y esophagojejunostomy in the lower mediastinum. However, some advanced type II carcinomas which cannot be resected R0 at the esophagus need esophagectomy and gastric pull-up. This surgical strategy is justified by the topography of the lesion and the corresponding lymphatic drainage. Very rare indications are seen for a limited resection with interposition of small bowel in some mucosal carcinomas or total esophagogastrectomy with colon interposition in very advanced tumors. The neoadjuvant treatment comprises especially chemoradiation for type I and chemotherapy for type II and III carcinomas and leads to a significant survival benefit compared to surgery alone."
CD009323,0,22874714,0,Laparoscopic resection of an epidermoid cyst within an intrapancreatic accessory spleen: a case report and review article.,We report a case of an epidermoid cyst within an intrapancreatic accessory spleen that was treated by laparoscopic excision. A 39-year-old man with no abdominal symptoms was incidentally found to have a cystic pancreatic lesion on computed tomography scan undertaken for suspected deep vein thrombosis. Further computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed similar findings and the laparoscopic resection of the distal pancreas and spleen was undertaken as malignancy could not be excluded. Microscopic analysis revealed a well-circumscribed epidermoid cyst within a thin splenic rim in the tail of the pancreas.

CD009323,0,22868357,0,Robot-assisted minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy is superior to the laparoscopic technique.,"Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) reduces postoperative morbidity, hospital stay, and recovery as compared with open distal pancreatectomy. Technical limitations of laparoscopic surgery may limit patient eligibility and require conversion to open or hand-assisted surgery to maintain patient safety. We hypothesized that robot-assisted distal pancreatectomy (RADP) was superior to LDP as a result of improved surgical manipulation and visualization, potentially expanding the indications for minimally invasive pancreatectomy."
CD009323,0,22864937,0,Totally laparoscopic pancreas-sparing duodenectomy.,"Pancreas-sparing duodenectomy (PSD) is a practical surgical procedure for patients with duodenal adenoma, which is difficult to resect endoscopically. We describe how we performed a totally laparoscopic PSD to resect a duodenal adenoma in a 64-year-old woman, who had been referred for treatment of a 50-mm villous polypoid mass in the second portion of the duodenum. We performed end-to-side anastomosis between the common duct of the bile and pancreatic ducts and the jejunal limb intracorporeally following the duodenal resection. A biliary leak developed, but resolved spontaneously and the patient was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 32. The surgical margin was free of neoplastic change. Although there is limited experience and appropriate indications must await future studies, this case demonstrates that laparoscopic PSD is feasible, safe, and effective for selected patients."
CD009323,0,22862957,0,Resuscitation by hyperbaric exposure from a venous gas emboli following laparoscopic surgery.,"Venous gas embolism is common after laparoscopic surgery but is only rarely of clinical relevance. We present a 52 year old woman undergoing laparoscopic treatment for liver cysts, who also underwent cholecystectomy. She was successfully extubated. However, after a few minutes she developed cardiac arrest due to a venous carbon dioxide (CO2) embolism as identified by transthoracic echocardiography and aspiration of approximately 7 ml of gas from a central venous catheter. She was resuscitated and subsequently treated with hyperbaric oxygen to reduce the size of remaining gas bubbles. Subsequently the patient developed one more episode of cardiac arrest but still made a full recovery. The courses of events indicate that bubbles had persisted in the circulation for a prolonged period. We speculate whether insufficient CO2 flushing of the laparoscopic tubing, causing air to enter the peritoneal cavity, could have contributed to the formation of the intravascular gas emboli. We conclude that persistent resuscitation followed by hyperbaric oxygen treatment after venous gas emboli contributed to the elimination of intravascular bubbles and the favourable outcome for the patient."
CD009323,0,22856493,0,Incisional hernia risk after hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery.,"Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) bridges traditional open surgery and pure laparoscopy. The HALS technique provides the necessary site for organ retrieval, reduces operative time, and realizes the postoperative benefits of laparoscopic techniques. Although the reported rates of incisional hernia should be theoretically low, we sought to determine our incidence of hernia after HALS procedures. A retrospective review of all HALS procedures was performed from July 2006 to June 2011. All patients who developed postoperative incisional hernias at the hand port site were confirmed by imaging or examination findings. Patient factors were reviewed to determine any predictors of hernia formation. Over the 5 years, 405 patients undergoing HALS procedures were evaluated: colectomy (264), nephrectomy (107), splenectomy/pancreatectomy (18), and ostomy reversal (10). The overall incidence of incisional hernia was 10.6 per cent. There were three perioperative wound dehiscences. The mean body mass index was significantly higher in the hernia group versus the no hernia cohort (32.1 vs 29.2 kg/m(2); P = 0.001). The hernia group also had a higher incidence of renal disease (18.6 vs 7.2%; P = 0.018). Mean time to hernia formation was 11.4 months (range, 1 to 57 months). Follow-up was greater than 12 months in 188 (46%) of patients, in which the rate of incisional hernia was 17 per cent. The rate of incisional hernia formation after hand-assisted laparoscopic procedures is higher than the reported literature. Because the mean time to hernia development is approximately 1 year, it is important to follow these patients to this end point to determine the true incidence of incisional hernia after hand-assisted laparoscopy."
CD009323,0,22854242,0,An incidental peri-adrenal cystic lesion.,"A 50-year-old man was found to have an incidental peri-adrenal cystic lesion on CT imaging which was removed laparoscopically. Histological examination showed a cystic structure composed of respiratory and cuboidal-type epithelium with underlying smooth muscle, cartilage and seromucinous glands. The differential diagnosis for such a lesion includes bronchogenic cyst or teratoma differentiated. This case report offers an overview of both the conditions and the difficulties encountered in the histological distinction."

CD009323,0,22844550,0,Adenocarcinoma of the small bowel in a patient with occlusive Crohn's disease.,"A 40-year-old male, diagnosed with mild Crohn's disease (CD) 11 years ago but with no prior abdominal surgeries, was diagnosed with a small bowel stricture, due to ongoing abdominal pain and intolerance of enteral diet, and referred for surgical treatment. Exploratory laparoscopy revealed a white solid mass causing a near total jejunal obstruction with significant proximal dilatation. An adjacent small node was sampled for frozen biopsy, revealing a lymph node infiltrated with adenocarcinoma. Laparoscopic assisted small bowel resection and appendectomy were carried out. Final pathological results supported the initial report of diffuse small bowel adenocarcinoma. In conclusion, once a small bowel stricture associated with CD is suspected, rapid action should be considered to avoid late diagnosis of a neoplasia."

The study presented a case of a 76-year old female patient who underwent nephrectomy, due to T2N0M0 clear cell renal carcinoma and was additionally diagnosed with two metachronous metastases to the gall-bladder and pancreas. Abdominal ultrasound performed 32 months after nephrectomy demonstrated the presence of cholelithiasis and gall-bladder polyp. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Clear cell renal carcinoma metastasis restricted to the gall-bladder mucosa was diagnosed on the basis of the histopathological examination. After surgery the patient remained under follow-up. In December, 2009 (47 months after nephrectomy) abdominal computer tomography (CT) revealed the presence of a tumor located in the tail of the pancreas. Distal pancreatic resection and splenectomy was performed. The histopathological examination confirmed the presence of clear cell renal carcinoma metastasis. The patient is in good general condition, under follow-up at the Oncological Outpatient Clinic."

CD009323,0,22842378,0,Incidental cystic endocrine tumor of the pancreas: a case report with immunohistochemical study.,"A large cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail was found incidentally in a 20-year-old female during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Pre-operative work up had revealed calculi in gall bladder and in addition, a cystic lesion in pancreas suggesting the possibility of a pseudocyst. A laparoscopic enucleation of the cyst was performed along with the removal of gallbladder. Microscopic examination of the resected specimen revealed a pancreatic cystic endocrine tumor; however, this tumor had produced no symptoms. Immunohistochemical studies of the tumor cells showed positivity for neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin indicating their neuroendocrine nature. Prognostic markers (CK19, CD10 and Ki67) indicated good prognosis. Although endocrine tumors of the pancreas are usually solid, cystic change occurs only rarely and such tumors should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients who have a cystic lesion in the pancreas in view of their rare transformation into a malignant tumor."

CD009323,0,22835010,0,Depletion of enteric gonadotropin-releasing hormone is found in a few patients suffering from severe gastrointestinal dysmotility.,"Many patients, especially women, suffer from severe gastrointestinal pain and dysmotility for several years without being diagnosed. Depletion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the enteric nervous system (ENS) has been described in some patients. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of GnRH in ENS and antibodies against GnRH in serum, in a dysmotility patient cohort of southern Sweden."
CD009323,0,22832801,0,Two cases of portal annular pancreas.,"Portal annular pancreas is one of the pancreatic fusion anomalies in which the uncinate process of the pancreas extends to fuse with the dorsal pancreas by encircling the portal vein or superior mesenteric vein. We report two consecutive patients with portal annular pancreas. The first case is a 71-year-old male patient who underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in the head of pancreas. His preoperative computed tomography scan showed the suprasplenic type portal annular pancreas. The second case is a 74-year-old female patient who underwent a laparoscopic anterior radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (RAMPS) for pancreatic body cancer. In operative finding, portal confluence (superior mesenteric vein-splenic vein-portal vein) was encased with the uncinate process of pancreas in both cases. Therefore, they required pancreatic division at the pancreatic neck portion twice. During the postoperative period, grade B and A, respectively, postoperative pancreatic fistulas occurred and were controlled by conservative management. Surgeons need to know about this rare pancreatic condition prior to surgical intervention to avoid complications, and to provide patients with well-designed, case-specific pancreatic surgery."
CD009323,0,22826784,0,Cystic pancreatic lymphangioma.,"Lymphangioma of the pancreas is a rare benign tumor of lymphatic origin. Retroperitoneal lymphangiomas account for 1% of all lymphangiomas. Herein, we report a case of cystic pancreatic lymphangioma diagnosed in 34 year-old female patient who was hospitalized for a slight pain in the epigastrium and vomiting. Radiological imaging revealed a large multiloculated cystic abdominal mass with enhancing septations involving the upper retroperitoneum. During the laparoscopic surgery, a well circumscribed polycystic tumor was completely excised preserving the pancreatic duct. The patient made a complete recovery and is disease-free 12 months postoperatively."

CD009323,0,22823174,0,Reversed intestinal malrotation with concurrent cecal carcinoma.,"A 57-year-old man was admitted with a type 2 (ulcerated with clear margin) cancer in the cecum. Contrast-enhanced CT showed that the superior mesenteric vein was anterior to the superior mesenteric artery, and the patient was suspected of having intestinal malrotation. A laparoscopic-assisted ileocecal resection was performed. At operation, the cecum and the transverse colon passed through the root of the mesentery behind the superior mesenteric artery with the duodenum. Therefore, this was thought to be a reversed-type intestinal malrotation. After the operation, 3D-CT colonography with duodenography images were reconstructed to retrospectively confirm the diagnosis of a reversed malrotation. These images clearly demonstrated the abnormal anatomy and overall orientation of the intestine. Patients with a reversed intestinal malrotation and concurrent cecal cancer are extremely rare. Herein, we present a patient who underwent a laparoscopic-assisted ileocecal resection for cecal cancer that presented concurrently with a reversed intestinal malrotation."
CD009323,0,22815028,0,Breast carcinoma with asymptomatic metastasis to the gallbladder.,"The biliary tract is an unusual site of metastasis from breast carcinoma, and this has rarely been reported in the literature.

CD009323,0,22811842,0,Current surgical management of pancreatic cancer.,"En bloc resection is the treatment of choice for localized pancreatic cancer. While the perioperative mortality associated with resection is low, it still carries a significant morbidity rate of up to 50% in certain high-risk subsets of patients. With advances in perioperative care, radical resection with inclusion of adjacent vascular structure to achieve negative margin status can be performed with comparable mortality and morbidity in high-volume centers. Early results with the use of minimally invasive technique in pancreatic surgery are promising. Recent data on perioperative care to decrease morbidity with pancreatic surgery will also be discussed."

CD009323,0,22800979,0,Acute and chronic pancreatitis: surgical management.,"Pancreatitis is becoming increasingly prevalent in children, posing new challenges to pediatric health care providers. Although some general adult treatment paradigms are applicable in the pediatric population, diagnostic workup and surgical management of acute and chronic pancreatitis have to be tailored to anatomic and pathophysiological entities peculiar to children. Nonbiliary causes of acute pancreatitis in children are generally managed nonoperatively with hydration, close biochemical and clinical observation, and early initiation of enteral feeds. Surgical intervention including cholecystectomy or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is often required in acute biliary pancreatitis, whereas infected pancreatic necrosis remains a rare absolute indication for pancreatic debridement and drainage via open, laparoscopic, or interventional radiologic procedure. Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by painful irreversible changes of the parenchyma and ducts, which may result in or be caused by inadequate ductal drainage. A variety of surgical procedures providing drainage, denervation, resection, or a combination thereof are well established to relieve pain and preserve pancreatic function."

CD009323,0,22791124,0,Successful laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: a case report and a reliable technique for pancreaticojejunostomy.,"Like other forms of laparoscopic surgery, laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (Lap-PD) is a minimally invasive procedure that can greatly reduce bleeding during surgery. We performed Lap-PD for a case of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. To remove the resected tissue from the body, we made a small incision directly above the line of transection of the distal pancreas (the cut stump). This procedure requires complex reconstructive procedures, which we performed through the same small incision. All reconstructive procedures, except for hepaticojejunostomy, were performed under direct visualization; hepaticojejunostomy was performed laparoscopically. The reconstructive surgery was effective and was as safe as open abdominal surgery. We also discuss the value of using an endoscopic linear stapler for Lap-PD pancreatic transection, to reduce extravasation of pancreatic fluid into the abdominal cavity during the resection of tumors involving the pancreatic ducts, such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm."

Here we present a case of a duodenal bulb carcinoid tumor successfully treated by laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection (LAEFR). An asymptomatic 65-year-old woman had a 10-mm, submucosal tumor on the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb. Abdominal CT revealed an enlarged lymph node adjacent to the duodenum and pancreas. Although we informed the patient of the need for pancreatoduodenectomy with a lymphadenectomy, the patient expressly requested LAEFR. After negative nodal metastasis was confirmed by an intraoperative frozen section of the enlarged nodes, LAEFR was performed using the endoscopic submucosal dissection technique under the laparoscopic assistance. The duodenal wall defect was closed by laparoscopy with an Albert anastomosis. The entire circumferential margin of the specimen was histopathologically negative for carcinoid tumor cells. In summary, LAEFR enables en bloc and whole-layer excision of nonperiampullary duodenal lesions with a sufficient surgical margin, both vertically and laterally. LAEFR is a minimally invasive and effective treatment for selected patients with duodenal carcinoid tumor."

A hypoechoic cystic tumor was detected incidentally by abdominal ultrasonography. It appeared to be a single cyst in the pancreatic tail with a contrasted mass lesion beside it. Laparoscopy-assisted spleen-preserving pancreatic tail resection was performed. Microscopic examination revealed that the cyst was surrounded by fibrous tissue and a thin layer of splenic tissue, adjacent to normal pancreatic parenchyma. The inner surface of the cyst was lined with non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. The diagnosis of an epidermoid cyst occurring in an intrapancreatic accessory spleen was confirmed. Laparoscopy-assisted spleen-preserving pancreatic resection is a safe and effective procedure for benign or low-grade malignant cystic diseases in the pancreas."
CD009323,0,22776305,0,Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver in association with spilled gallstones 3 years after laparoscopic cholecystectomy: report of a case.,"We report on a case of a female patient diagnosed with inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver in association with spilled gallstones 3 years after laparoscopic cholecystectomy for calculous acute cholecystitis. She was asymptomatic, but CT revealed an intrahepatic mass and two other extrahepatic masses between the liver and the diaphragm. Furthermore, diffusion-weighted MRI and PET suggested all three lesions could be malignant tumors. As the preoperative diagnosis was intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma with peritoneal disseminations, we performed a posterior segmentectomy of the liver combined with partial resection of the diaphragm. Histological examination showed the intrahepatic tumor was an inflammatory granuloma with abscess formations. There were bilirubin stones between the liver and the diaphragm. Therefore, the tumor was diagnosed as inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver in association with spilled gallstones. In conclusion, the liver tumor emerged after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and may involve inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver in association with spilled gallstones."
CD009323,0,22763897,0,Hemorrhagic ascites: are we missing endometriosis?,"Peritoneal tuberculosis, carcinomatosis and pancreatic ascites are often considered as differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic ascites. Endometriosis can rarely present as hemorrhagic ascites and closely mimic these conditions. When this occurs without common clinical features of endometriosis, it can create a diagnostic challenge to the treating physician. We present three patients with endometriosis who presented with hemorrhagic ascites; two of them did not have gynecological symptoms or significant pelvic disease. These patients were evaluated several times in many centers and even received multiple courses of anti-tuberculous treatment. The diagnosis was made by histologic examination of parietal peritoneum obtained by laparoscopy or laparotomy. The diagnosis was missed possibly because of the atypical presentation, lack of clinical suspicion and incomplete assessment. In conclusion, this potentially treatable condition should be considered as a differential diagnosis for hemorrhagic ascites in a premenopausal woman."
CD009323,0,22763577,0,Learning curve for laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy in a high-volume hospital.,"Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) for benign and borderline pancreatic lesions is recently becoming the treatment of choice in experienced centres. No data have been published on learning curve so far. The purpose of this study was to identify the learning curve period for performing LDP. Between March 2009 and August 2010 all patients with lesions of pancreatic body or tail were assessed for eligibility for LDP. Exclusion criteria were: major vessels contact in cancer patients, severe organ dysfunction, BMI > 35, and refusing laparoscopic approach. All laparoscopic procedures were carried out by the same surgical team with large experience in open pancreatic surgery. All patients were treated according to an early recovery after surgery protocol. Primary endpoint was conversion rate. Secondary endpoints were operative time, operative blood loss, postoperative morbidity, and length of stay (LOS). Sixty patients were assessed for eligibility. Thirty (50.0 %) patients met the exclusion criteria, while the other 30 patients underwent LDP. Spleen-preserving procedure was planned in the 17 patients with benign lesion and successfully performed in 15 (82.3 %). Overall conversion rate was 23.3 %, but it dropped significantly after the first ten patients (p = 0.01). Mean operative time progressively declined from 254 min in the first subgroup of ten patients to 206 min in the second (p = 0.09 vs. first), and 183 min in the third subgroup (p = 0.006 vs. first). No significant difference was found for operative blood loss, postoperative morbidity rate, and LOS in the different subgroups. Both conversion rate and operative time dropped after the first ten patients who underwent LDP. Strict selection criteria, high-volume hospital, and experienced team in open pancreatic surgery may have played a role in shortening the learning curve."

We reviewed a series of patients with cholecystitis receiving either partial or subtotal cholecystectomies and compared it with total cholecystectomies with respect to complications. A retrospective chart review was performed on all subtotal cholecystectomies performed for cholecystitis at University Medical Center of El Paso from June 2004 to December 2010. A similar number of patients who had total cholecystectomies for cholecystitis were selected as a comparison group from that same time period. A total of 116 patients who had subtotal and total cholecystectomies were reviewed (58 patients in each group). There were seven postoperative complications noted in the subtotal cholecystecomy (SC) group versus 14 for the total cholecystectomy (TC) group. Three patients in the SC group had cystic duct leaks, all successfully treated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with biliary stenting. There were two patients who had common bile duct injuries in the TC group and none in the SC group. Two patients had duodenal injuries in the TC group. Subtotal cholecystectomy is a viable alternative to total cholecystectomy in cases of complicated cholecystitis."

CD009323,0,22733352,0,The current state of robotic-assisted pancreatic surgery.,"Pancreatic surgery is challenging for both surgeon and patient. With the advent of minimally invasive surgical techniques, patient morbidity could be reduced. However, these techniques must conform to established principles of open pancreatic surgery with regards to meticulous dissection, haemostasis and oncologic results. The robotic platform is utilized in all facets of surgery, and is being increasingly applied in pancreatic surgery. As with the introduction of any new technology, this approach must undergo rigorous examination before widespread adoption of the technique. In this article, we review the techniques and outcomes of robotic-assisted pancreatic resections, focusing on robotic-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy, robotic-assisted distal pancreatectomy and robotic-assisted central pancreatectomy. As the outcomes of robotic-assisted surgery have yet to be rigorously evaluated against the gold standard of open surgery, this Review also highlights major laparoscopic pancreatic series in an effort to summarize the available literature on minimally invasive pancreatic surgery."

CD009323,0,22720865,0,Left-sided gallbladder: an incidental finding on laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Transposition of the gallbladder to the left side without situs inversus viscerum is rare. These gallbladders are situated under the left lobe of the liver between Segment III and IV or on Segment III to the left of the falciform ligament. This is a report of a 50-year-old woman who was admitted to our department with a history of pain in her right upper abdomen. The physical examination showed tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen without a Murphy's sign. Abdominal ultrasonography showed gall bladder stones without dilatation of the bile ducts. The patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy using the French position and four ports positioned as usual. We discovered a left-sided gallbladder located on the left of the round ligament. The gallbladder was excised as usual. Intraoperative cholangiogram showed neither dilatation of the bile ducts nor associated congenital anomalies of the biliary tree. The patient was discharged on the first postoperative day. Because routine preoperative examinations may not detect the anomaly, the latter may take surgeons by surprise during laparoscopy. Awareness of the unpredictable confluence of the cystic duct into the common bile duct and selective use of intraoperative cholangiography both contributed to the safe laparoscopic management of this unusual problem."

Clinical data from 39 patients diagnosed with XGC by pathological examination between 2002 and 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. As a result, in this group of patients, the male to female ratio was 30:9 and the average age of XGC onset was 62.2 years. Clinical manifestation of the disease was similar to general cholecystitis and preoperative CT examination showed that there were only 4 XGC cases, while the others were possibly misdiagnosed. Intraoperative observations showed that all the patients had gallbladder wall thickening. This was associated with gallbladder stones in 37 patients (94.9 %), choledocholith in 11 patients (28.2 %), and Mirizzi syndrome in 5 patients (12.8 %). In this study, intraoperative frozen section pathology was conducted in 14 patients and no gallbladder cancer was found. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed on 7 patients, of which two were transferred to laparotomy. Of the remaining 32 cases, 25 were subjected to open cholecystectomy, 3 to partial cholecystectomy, and 4 to the cholecystectomy and partial liver wedge resection. It was concluded that XGC is a unique type of cholecystitis with atypical clinical manifestations and is often difficult to diagnose preoperatively. Pathological examination is a key to diagnose XGC and cholecystectomy is the primary surgical treatment. In patients with choledochectasia or jaundice, for whom we cannot exclude calculus of common bile duct, common bile duct exploration should be considered. The prognosis of XGC appears to be good with the above approaches."

CD009323,0,22686860,0,Projected focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver with pronounced atypical ductular reaction resembling ductal plate and expressing KIT.,"A 26-year-old woman was found to have a left abdominal tumor in the space among the hepatic left lobe, stomach and spleen. A laparoscopic examination revealed that the tumor was a projected liver tumor, and resection of the tumor was performed. Grossly, the tumor was not encapsulated and measured 4 cm × 4 cm × 5 cm. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of mature hepatocytes, fibrous septae, abnormal vessels and ductular reaction (DR). A pathological diagnosis of projected focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) was made. Characteristically, the cells of the DR showed atypical features such as small cells and hyperchromatic nuclei. The DR assumed the features of ductal plate-like structures and immunohistochemically expressed KIT, suggesting that the cells of DR are stem cells and that when the stem cells proliferate they take a form of ductal plate-like structures, similar to fetal bile duct development. Immunohistochemically, the cells of DR were positive for cytokeratin (CK) AE1/3, CK CAM5.2, CK7, CK8, CK18, CK19, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA19-9, Ki-67 (labeling = 3%) and KIT, but negative for CK20, p53, TTF-1, CDX2, MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC6.

The difficult diagnosis, the role of laparoscopic surgery and the relationship between small bowel tumors and celiac disease are discussed. A 49-year-old man presented with recurrent melena, nausea, vomiting and anemia. A stenosis of the jejunum was documented by means of CT scan and video capsule enteroscopy. A laparoscopy was scheduled. A tumor, found in the first jejunal loop, was removed by laparoscopic surgery. Histopathology revealed a rare mucinous adenocarcinoma associated with epithelial changes secondary to celiac disease.

Posterior osteosynthesis in T10-L1 with laminectomy in T10-T12 and posterolateral arthrodesis in T11-T12 was performed because of a dorsal traumatic vertebral fracture. On hospital day 7, because of an acute abdomen, surgical laparoscopic exploration showed sterile bloody fluid without any evident hemorrhagic injury. On hospital day 11, the patient was reoperated on by the laparoscopic approach for increasing abdominal pain and fever: a peritoneal biliary fluid was aspirated. After conversion to open surgery, cholecystectomy was performed. Intraoperative cholangiography was considered as normal. On arrival at our institution 13 days after injury, the patient was operated on for a biliary peritonitis. Intraoperatively, a trans-cystic cholangiography showed a biliary leakage of the common bile duct; a T-tube was placed into the common bile duct; a subhepatic drainage was placed too.

These locally advanced cancers often involve the celiac axis or the common hepatic artery and are therefore declared unresectable. The extended distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac artery may offer a chance of complete resection. We present the case of a 48-year-old female with pancreatic body cancer invading the celiac axis. The patient underwent laparoscopy to exclude hepatic and peritoneal metastasis. Subsequently, a selective embolization of the common hepatic artery was performed to enlarge arterial flow to the hepatobiliary system and the stomach via the pancreatoduodenal arcades from the superior mesenteric artery. Fifteen days after embolization, the extended distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and en bloc resection of the celiac axis was carried out. The postoperative course was uneventful, and complete tumor resection was achieved.

CD009323,0,22549374,0,Laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision for right colon cancer.,"Laparoscopic colectomy for colon cancer has become a standard of care, with a number of publications highlighting its safety, improved postoperative recovery, and excellent oncologic outcomes. Complete mesocolic excision, recently reemphasized, is associated with superior oncologic outcomes, although this has not been discussed for laparoscopic surgery. A laparoscopic approach was performed for right colon cancer using a four-trocar technique. The key steps demonstrated are identification and high division of the ileocolic pedicle, medial-to-lateral mobilization of the ascending colon preserving the posterior mesocolic fascia, identification and high division of the right branch of the middle colic artery, mobilization of the greater omentum and hepatic flexure, completion of lateral mobilization of the ascending colon from the retroperitoneum, and mobilization of the small bowel mesentery up to the duodenum. A prospective series of 52 consecutive patients with right colon cancer underwent laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision with high-vessel ligation. Four of the patients required laparoscopic en bloc extended resections for local invasion. The median operative time was 136 min (interquartile range [IQR], 105-167 min), and the median blood loss was 20 ml (IQR, 10-45 ml). The median hospital stay was 3 days (IQR, 3-5 days). All the patients had an R0 oncologic resection with median margins of 12 cm, and a median of 22 lymph nodes (IQR, 18-29 lymph nodes) was retrieved. The median follow-up period was 38 months (IQR, 23-54 months). Of 14 patients with tumor-positive lymph nodes, 2 experienced distant recurrence. There were no local recurrences, but four patients experienced metastatic disease at a median of 37 months (IQR, 22-46 months). The median overall survival time was 38 months (IQR, 23-54 months). The embedded didactic video demonstrates a straight laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision with high-vessel ligation for a patient who had a right colon cancer. Laparoscopic right complete mesocolic excision is a safe and effective procedure associated with excellent 3-year oncologic outcomes and accelerated postoperative recovery."

We herein report the first case of insulinoma of the pancreas treated by RPS. RPS enucleation was performed for a 23-year-old Japanese female who was admitted to our hospital with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia attributable to an insulinoma. The preoperative examinations confirmed the diagnosis of a solitary insulinoma of the pancreatic tail. Enucleation of the insulinoma using RPS was performed. A 2.5-cm umbilical incision was made, and three laparoscopic trocars were individually inserted into the abdominal cavity via this incision. Another 3-mm trocar was inserted from the left subcostal region. All procedures that were usually performed in conventional laparoscopic surgery were also performed by RPS: intraoperative ultrasonography, mobilization of the tail of the pancreas, enucleation of the tumor, and suturing of the stump. A mechanical manipulator, the Radius Surgical System (Radius), was used for suturing and ligation. The Radius was sufficient to overcome in-line viewing and hand/instrument collisions, and enabled us to perform precise suturing and ligation. Serial blood sugar, C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR), and immunoreactive insulin (IRI) measurements revealed that all values were normal after resection. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. RPS was successfully applied for enucleation of a solitary mass in the tail of the pancreas, and represents an alternative to conventional laparoscopic surgery. This method is technically feasible and results in superior cosmesis. The Radius facilitated advanced laparoscopic surgery and may also have advantages in RPS."

CD009323,0,22487915,0,Diagnostic transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy for staging of pancreatic and esophageal cancer.,"Pancreatic and esophageal cancers are both gastrointestinal malignancies with relatively low long term survival. In part, the aggressiveness of these tumors is related to local and distant metastatic potential, subsequently affecting prognosis and treatment modalities. Currently, the mainstay of staging involves in-depth radiographic imaging with surgery offered for potentially curative tumors. As a result, staging becomes a key determinant in the role of surgical resection. As minimally invasive approaches continue to gain popularity, the idea of natural orifice surgery has been raised as a possible adjunct to staging neoplasias. Currently, the insertion of a perioral endoscope to gain access to the peritoneal cavity via a transgastric incision has been investigated, with demonstration of feasibility and efficacy in several animal studies and limited clinical studies. Similar techniques have been employed to gain access to the thoracic cavity via a transesophageal incision in early animal studies. This article aims to outline the advantages and limitations of natural orifice endoscopic surgery, and review the use of endoscopic techniques to assess the intraperitoneal cavity via a transgastric incision for determining local and widespread metastases with reference to pancreatic carcinoma.

CD009323,0,22458522,0,Pancreatic cancer surgery: the state of the art.,"Pancreatic cancer patients have an extremely poor survival prognosis, and surgical resection remains the only curative treatment. Greater experience in pancreatic surgery and developments in surgical techniques have reduced surgical mortality and morbidity rates. It has been suggested that experienced pancreaticoduodenectomy centers should have mortality rates of less than 5% and major complication rates of less than 40%. Surgical resection followed by combined adjuvant therapy is currently the standard treatment for resectable pancreas cancer. Patients with borderline or marginal resectable tumors are beginning to have favorable outcomes following neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation. A number of prospective randomized trials have concluded that ""extended"" pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head cancer, involving radical dissection of lymph nodes and peripancreatic soft tissue, does not appear to provide any survival benefits compared with ""standard"" pancreaticoduodenectomy. Conversely, extensive surgery for pancreatic tail or body cancer (i.e., radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy) can result in favorable R0 resection rates and survival outcomes. However, more prospective randomized trial data are required before these conclusions can be considered established. Laparoscopic approaches are being increasingly used in the field of pancreatic tumor surgery. Moreover, robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery has also been tried in some expert centers. Again, at present a lack of outcome data prevent any definitive conclusion at this stage on the usefulness of those approaches compared to standard open approaches. Finally, a major problem hindering efforts to identify optimal surgical treatment modalities for pancreas cancer is the lack of a clear definition and standardization of surgical procedures and pathologic descriptions. The American Hepato- PancreatoBiliary Association/Society of Surgical Oncology/Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract conference on pancreatic cancer held in 2008 resulted in a consensus statement as an important first step in overcoming this fundamental hurdle."

CD009323,0,22447440,0,Urgent MRI with MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) of acute cholecystitis and related complications: diagnostic role and spectrum of imaging findings.,"Acute cholecystitis, which is usually associated with gallstones, is one of the commonest surgical causes of emergency hospital admission and may be further complicated by mural necrosis, perforation, and abscess formation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly available in the emergency setting. Technically improved equipment and faster acquisition protocols allow excellent tissue contrast and MRI is now an attractive modality for imaging acute abdominal disorders. The use of MRI with MR cholangiopancreatography in the emergency setting provides rapid, noninvasive, and confident diagnosis or exclusion of acute cholecystitis and of coexistent choledocholithiasis. To familiarize the reader with these cross-sectional imaging appearances, this paper reviews MRI findings consistent with uncomplicated cholecystitis. These include gallbladder distension, intraluminal sludge and gallstones, impacted stones obstructing the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, thickening of the gallbladder wall, abnormal signal intensity and edematous stratification, and pericholecystic and perihepatic fluid, plus increased enhancement of the gallbladder wall and adjacent liver parenchyma when intravenous paramagnetic contrast is used. Furthermore, MRI allows prompt detection and comprehensive visualization and characterization of cholecystitis-related complications such as gangrene, perforation, pericholecystic abscess, and intrahepatic fistulization. Some previous literature reports, and our experience, suggest that, when available, MRI should be recommended to provide prompt and efficient triage of patients with suspected cholecystitis and inconclusive clinical, laboratory, and sonographic findings. It facilitates appropriate therapeutic planning, including the timing of surgery (emergency or delayed), approach (laparoscopic or laparotomic), and need for preoperative or intraoperative removal of stone(s) in the common bile duct."

Case-report and literature review].,"A 73-year-old man, who previously underwent laparotomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, was admitted in the emergency room for acute small bowel obstruction related to a strangulated Spieghelian hernia. On CT-scan, the hernia was located at the lateral border of the right rectus abdominis muscle below the external oblique muscle, among the transverse abdominis and internal oblique muscles layers. Spieghelian hernias (or hernia of the linea semilunaris) often occur at the level of a weak spot where the linea accurata crosses the linea semilunaris, when the posterior layer of the rectus gain changes its conformation. This weak spot is limited underneath by the inferior epigastric artery. When examining a patient with a previous history of laparotomy presenting with acute small bowel obstruction, it is mandatory to exclude a possible strangulated Spieghelian hernia before concluding to postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions. Spieghelian hernias are asymptomatic in approximately 90% of cases but entail a high risk of strangulation.

CD009323,0,22421760,0,[Laparoscopic surgery for pancreatic cancer].,"Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is currently in widespread use because of its technical simplicity, although laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy is practiced in only a limited number of surgical institutions due to the associated technical difficulties especially at reconstruction. The indication for the treatment of pancreatic cancer by a laparoscopic procedure remains controversial. Because pancreatic cancer is already advanced at the time of diagnosis in many cases, it requires a difficult radical operation in terms of lymphadenectomy with nerves plexus in laparoscopic surgery. The oncologic clearance of pancreatic resection may be achievable by laparoscopic surgery, although longer follow-up and larger series of treatment are still needed."

During the operation cystic duct and vessels are usually controlled by Hem-o-lok clips. However, recently we found clips dropping into CBD in 8 patients during fiberoptic choledochoscope 2-3 months after operation. Therefore, there is risk that clip can migrate during postoperative period, which probably lead to hemorrhage and bile leakage after LC if this occurs within postoperative few days, or even cause recurrent stone in CBD. So, using of Hem-o-lok clips may be not a safe method to control vessels and cystic duct during LC. To our knowledge, this condition has not previously been reported. In our view, other more effective and safe method ligating cystic duct and gallbladder vessels, such as effective and convenient thread knotting method, should be investigated."

We report the case of a 77-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with epigastric pain, melena and anaemia. After clinical examination, laboratory evaluation and radiological work-up the diagnosis of a jejunal intussusception was made. Exploratory laparoscopy revealed a large tumour arising from the jejunum, approximately 20 cm distal to the angle of Treitz. Small bowel resection with an end-to-end anastomosis was performed. Histological examination showed an intestinal melanoma. There are different theories concerning the origin of malignant melanoma in the small bowel. Although the small and large intestines normally contain no melanocytes, these cells have occasionally been found in the alimentary and respiratory tracts and even in lymph nodes, which supports the theory of a primary origin of melanoma at these sites. Since this was a solitary intestinal lesion and there was no history of cutaneous melanoma, we conclude that this could be an example of a very rare primary melanoma of the small intestine."

CD009323,0,22341251,0,The minimally invasive approach to surgical management of pancreatic diseases.,"Laparoscopic pancreas surgery has undergone rapid development over the past decade. Although acceptability among traditional surgeons has been low, emerging specialty centers are reporting excellent outcomes for advanced and complex operations, such as pancreaticoduodenectomy. A note of caution is necessary: These outstanding results are from skilled surgeons, many of whom are pioneers in the field, who have overcome the learning curve over many years of innovation. As the procedures gain wider practice, outcomes need to be carefully watched because many of these procedures are extremely demanding technically. Although many have suggested that controlled, randomized studies comparing laparoscopic pancreatic resections with open resections are necessary to establish the efficacy of laparoscopic procedure, the cumulative data on the safety and efficacy of the laparoscopic procedure argues against such an approach. The logistic difficulties of conducting such studies will be considerable given patient preferences, the need for multicenter studies, and the rapid adoption of the laparoscopic procedure among experienced pancreatic surgeons. A more reasonable approach to truly evaluate the safety of these procedures is the establishment of a national registry that can measure progress of the field and record outcomes in the wider, nonspecialty community. Hepatobiliary training programs should also establish a minimal standard of training for many of the advanced procedures, such as the pancreaticoduodenectomy, so that the benefit of laparoscopic surgery can be made available outside of just a few specialty centers."

Pathologically his tumor was papillary adenocarcinoma suspected to invade to the liver-bed minimally. A lymph node involvement was solitary located at right side of hepatoduodenal ligament (behind biliary tract). Case 2 was a 73-year-old man who was pathologically diagnosed to be advanced gallbladder carcinoma after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. CT scan and MRI revealed a mass sized 2 cm in diameter, at the gallbladder-bed, and PET exam showed a hot spot at this site only. Therefore, he underwent a radical surgery like case 1. Pathologically the tumor was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and a lymph node involvement was solitary and located behind a biliary tract.

CD009323,0,22198808,0,Neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors: guidelines for management and update.,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are a diverse group of rare neoplasms. Commonly referred to as islet cell tumors, PanNETs are classified as functional or nonfunctional depending on their production of specific pancreatic endocrine hormones (e.g. insulin, gastrin, glucagon, and others) and association with the resultant clinical syndromes. While most PanNETs are sporadic, syndromic patients, in particular those with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) and von Hippel Lindau (VHL), are at increased risk of developing these tumors. Recent investigations of patients with sporadic and syndromic PanNETs have elucidated critical pathways in tumor development, such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and its downstream growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Prognosis ranges from favorable for localized, low-grade neoplasms to poor for advanced, high-grade tumors. Regardless of the stage at presentation, surgery is the first-line therapy for patients with disease amenable to surgical resection. We favor formal pancreatectomy with conventional lymph node sampling for the vast majority of patients, either through open or laparoscopic techniques. Those with insulinomas, however, may be candidates for enucleation. Cytoreductive surgery is also recommended for patients with locoregional recurrences or hepatic metastases. Regional adjuvants such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and others are often employed in an attempt to palliate symptoms and prolong survival. Unfortunately, cytotoxic chemotherapy has been largely ineffective in treating patients with PanNETs. The somatostatin analogue octreotide, however, has been effective in palliating symptoms and slowing the progression of disease. Other promising systemic agents, including sunitinib and everolimus, have targeted critical PanNET signaling pathways. In summary, surgery remains the principal therapeutic strategy for patients with PanNETs, but continued research may identify more robust systemic therapies for those with advanced disease."

Between the transverse mesocolon and the pancreas and duodenum, there was a transverse retrocolic space, which was enclosed cranially by the radix of the transverse mesocolon. In CT images, healthy PRF was noted as slender line of middle density, continuing to the transverse fascia. The retrocolic spaces was unidentifiable, unless they were filled with retroperitoneal lesions.

Sixteen patients were identified; 2/16 patients had undergone distal pancreatectomy as a component of another multiorgan open procedure, and were thus excluded. The remaining 14 patients had consented for LDP. Conversion occurred in 4/14 cases. Converted patients trended towards increased OR, EBL, and LOS (P = not significant). No mortalities occurred, and overall morbidities included: pancreatic fistula (n = 2), splenic abscess (n = 1), and pneumonia (n = 1). LDP-splenectomy (n = 3/14) was associated with both increased EBL (683 mL ± 388 vs 168 ± 141, P < 0.002) and increased transfusion rate (3/3 vs 3/11, P = 0.05), as compared with LDP-splenic preservation. LDP with splenic artery preservation (LDP-SAP) was completed in 7 of 14 patients, with less OR (2 hours 29 minutes ± 53 minutes vs 3 hours 40 minutes ± 1 hour, P < 0.05), a decreased transfusion rate (14% vs 71%, P = 0.05), and decreased LOS (2.8 days vs 6.8 days, P = 0.002) compared with LDP without SAP. Pathology was intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) (n = 5), ductal carcinoma (n = 3), high grade dysphasia (n = 2), neuroendocrine tumor (n = 2), and pancreatitis (n = 2). Patients undergoing LDP-SAP demonstrated superior peri-procedural outcomes. This series of nonselected consecutive patients supports that LDP is technically feasible with a comparable procedural outcome to the selected-patient literature, suggesting potentially expanded indications for LDP."

CD009323,0,22184309,0,Raising the thinker: new concept for dissecting the cystic pedicle during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Imprecise dissection due to poor visualization of anatomic structures is among the major causes of biliary injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Developing new illustrational and rendering techniques represents an important part in decreasing visual deception and subsequent bile duct injuries. We use the model of one of the most well-known pieces of art, Rodin's The Thinker, to visualize the gallbladder and cystic pedicle structures. This minimizes visual deception before dissection, especially in cases with obscured structures. Our method, raising The Thinker, is based on the remarkable similarity between the sculpture and the topographic anatomy of the gallbladder. The method can be used not only for better orientation and visualization during laparoscopic cholecystectomy but also as a tool to complement the teaching of laparoscopic biliary anatomy to surgical residents and medical students."

As a pilot study, pigs (n = 6) underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy using a standard stapler. Daily drain output and lipase were measured postoperative day 5 and 14. In a second study, pancreatic transection was performed to occlude the proximal and distal duct at the pancreatic neck using a standard stapler (n = 6), or stapler with bovine pericardial strip buttress (n = 6). Results. In pilot study, 3/6 animals had drain lipase greater than 3x serum on day 14. In the second series, drain volumes were not significantly different between buttressed and control groups on day 5 (55.3 ± 31.6 and 29.3 ± 14.2 cc, resp.), nor on day 14 (9.5 ± 4.2 cc and 2.5 ± 0.8 cc, resp., P = 0.13). Drain lipase was not statistically significant on day 5 (3,166 ± 1,433 and 6,063 ± 1,872 U/L, resp., P = 0.25) or day 14 (924 ± 541 and 360 ± 250 U/L).

Pigment stones are the commonest type of gallstones in children, without recognizable predisposing factors in infants or secondary to a predisposing disease such as chronic hemolysis and ileal disease in children. In adolescents, idiopathic cholesterol gallstones accounts for the majority, such as in adults. Gallbladder stones are found in 80 to 90% of cases and common bile duct stones in 10 to 20% of cases. When common bile duct stones are found, a choledocal cyst with anomalous pancreatobiliary duct junction needs to be excluded. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography should be performed in first line. Cholecystectomy is not indicated for silent gallstones, except in children with a predisposing disease such as chronic hemolysis. Treatment of common bile duct stones includes interventional radiologic, endoscopic or surgical procedures. Stone extraction may be performed at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with or without sphincterotomy, combined with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In children without a predisposing disease or no residual gallstones indicating a cholescystectomy, conservative management (percutaneous cholangiography with biliary drainage) may be proposed in specialised centers, especially for infants. A hepaticojejunostomy is indicated in cases of choledocal cyst with anomalous pancreatobiliary duct junctions."

Case report and review of the literature.,"The small intestine is a frequent site of melanoma metastases and the most common cause of secondary intestinal tumors. Even though, its presentation with intestinal obstruction due to intussusception is very rare. We present a 47-year-old woman with a medical history of facial melanoma operated 17 years ago and recently diagnosed of cervical recurrence who complained of abdominal pain of one week duration accompanied with vomiting and abdominal distension. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed marked distension of the small intestine with features suggesting intussusception of the distal ileum. At laparoscopic exploration a massive ileocolic intussusception was found with invagination of the last 60 cm of ileum inside the cecum and ascending colon. Surgical reduction revealed a tumor of approximately 2 cm in the distal end of the intussuscepted intestine acting as the lead point. Resection of non-viable ileum along with the tumor and end-to-end anastomosis was performed. Many other lesions of smaller size were found distantly in the proximal small bowel but were not treated. The patient had a full recovery and was discharged three days after surgery. Pathological examination showed metastatic melanoma and a positron emission tomography (PET) scan confirmed disseminated disease with brain metastasis. The patient died three months after surgery. Intestinal occlusion due to metastatic disease is a rare condition but should be taken into account particularly in patients with history of cancer. Surgical intervention with a mini-invasive laparoscopic approach is feasible. Intestinal resection and anastomosis is mandatory for either curative or palliative intentions providing a satisfactory treatment."

Pancreatic tumor in the neck of the pancreas is a challenging issue. Pancreaticoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy with/without splenectomy are the usual modes of surgery for them. Central pancreatectomy is a rare surgical procedure, even in open surgery. With the development of laparoscopic experiences, a few cases of laparoscopic central pancreatectomy have begun to be reported, but they are believed to be still demanding tremendous laparoscopic skills and experiences. However, advancements in technology have encouraged surgeons to overcome the limitations of conventional laparoscopic surgery. Herein, we report a case of robot-assisted central pancreatectomy with pancreaticogastrostomy (transgastric approach). Wrist-like movements of effector instruments and stable 3-D visualization provided by the robot surgical system are believed to enhance the precise and safe laparoscopic performance.

Understanding of the anatomical structure of the pancreas and its surroundings is required in various situations in left upper abdominal surgery including the laparoscopic approach. Spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy is indicated for lesions confined to the pancreas. Two major spleen-preserving procedures reported are the Warshaw procedure that conserves the spleen by blood flow from the short gastric vessels and the Kimura procedure that preserves the spleen with splenic vessels. Considering the laparoscopic approach, the surgeon may preserve splenic vessels from the median toward the splenic hilum without mobilization of the spleen. A standard distal pancreatectomy using the medial approach is presented on video. The intraoperative complications of distal pancreatectomy can be minimized by avoiding splenic capsule injury, by careful differentiation of the splenic artery from the common hepatic artery, and by secure closure of the splenic vein stump. The incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula following distal pancreatectomy is reported to be 13% in a nationwide pancreatic cancer registry. Based on the results of an international randomized trial of hand-sewn and staple closure of the pancreatic stump, the closure method of the pancreatic stump can be the surgeon's choice."

Regardless of the various diagnostic modalities available, it is difficult to distinguish preoperatively the cystadenoma both from a simple liver cyst, and from a cystic carcinoma of the bile duct. An incomplete surgical removal of the cyst often results in a higher risk of size increase and recurrence, even considering that the lesion may degenerate into a cystadenocarcinoma. Between January 2004 and May 2011, 1,173 liver resections were carried out at the Hepatobiliary Surgery Unit of San Raffaele Hospital: 12 of these were performed for cystadenoma. Forty-six patients underwent laparoscopic liver cysts deroofing: definitive histological examination in six of these patients revealed instead the diagnosis of cystadenoma. In 50% of cases, the diagnosis of cystadenoma was therefore acquired as a result of an incidental finding. The patients were all female, median age 45 years. The liver resection included six cases of left hepatectomy, three left lobectomies, and three of the right hepatectomy. The operations were performed by laparotomy, with the exception of two left lobectomies completed laparoscopically. In all cases, the postoperative course was without major complications. The resection was radical in all cases and the median hospital stay was 5 days. At a median follow-up of 16 months (range 7-30), all patients are alive and disease free. Biliary cystadenomas can easily be misunderstood and interpreted as simple hepatic cysts. Radical surgical resection is necessary and provides good short- and long-term outcomes."

A 36-year-old woman with a cystic mass in the tail of the pancreas, which had been discovered incidentally at a medical checkup, was referred to our department for further examination. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasonography and positron emission tomography demonstrated a multilocular cyst in the tail of the pancreas without any evidence of malignancy, although differential diagnosis was extremely difficult because of the neoplasm-like appearance of the lesion. Therefore, we performed laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy under a preoperative diagnosis of mucinous cystic neoplasm. Postoperative pathologic examination demonstrated an epidermoid cyst arising from a heterotopic spleen within the pancreas. This is the first report of successful laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for an epidermoid cyst arising in an intrapancreatic accessory spleen. One virtually has no chance to diagnose an epidermoid cyst in an accessory spleen on the basis of preoperative diagnostic workup, and consequently the type of surgical resection (open vs. laparoscopic) would be conditioned by factors other than the clinical entity suspected at the preoperative period."
CD009323,0,22002275,0,Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy: does splenic preservation affect outcomes?,"Although the spleen is often routinely resected during both open and laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies, a splenectomy can increase the risk of postoperative and life-long infectious complications. Spleen-preserving laparoscopic pancreatectomies can technically be more difficult because of the delicate dissection of the splenic vessels. We performed a retrospective review of 34 laparoscopic pancreatectomies done at our institution. All procedures were done laparoscopically without hand assistance. Attempts were made in all patients to conserve the spleen, which was successful in 10 patients (29%). In the splenectomy group, 9 patients had 12 surgical complications (26%), which was statistically significant compared with the spleen-preserving group, in which there were no complications. This included 7 patients with a pancreatic leak (20%) and 3 with postoperative hemorrhage requiring reexploration (9%). Patients with spleen-preserving pancreatectomies had significantly less blood loss and shorter operative time compared with patients who underwent concomitant splenectomy. Splenic preservation should be attempted in all patients undergoing laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy unless there are overriding oncological or anatomic concerns."

The authors encountered such a case in a 10-year-old girl with a giant solid pseudopapillary neoplasm at the uncinate process of the pancreas. Imaging examination showed there was a distinct distance between the neoplasm and the main pancreatic duct. Using a 4-port transperitoneal laparoscopic technique, complete resection of the tumor was successfully performed.

CD009323,0,21964709,0,Laparoscopic surgery for pancreatic lesions: current status and future.,"Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery has been gaining increasing recognition in recent years, and its practice has increased despite its highly complex procedure and longer learning curve compared with surgeries for other abdominal organs. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and tumor enucleation are two of the fastest-growing techniques and are currently in wide use because of their comparable technical simplicity. Literature review showed that laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and enucleation are safe and efficient approaches for benign and low-degree malignant tumors; however, the indication for malignant tumors remains controversial. Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy is practiced in a limited number of surgical centers and presented as case reports or in small series. Although its feasibility was demonstrated by many surgeons, whether the laparoscopic procedure can achieve benefits comparable to or even more prominent than those of an open procedure has not been clinically proven. Prospective, randomized, controlled trials of laparoscopic operation versus open pancreatic surgery are necessary to justify the wide application and routine practice of the laparoscopic procedure for pancreatic lesions."
CD009323,0,21964708,0,Towards the optimization of management of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common neoplasm in the world, closely correlated with viral hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. The vast majority of HCC patients present at a late stage and are unsuitable for surgery due to limited liver functional reserve. Tumors can involve major vessels or hilar structures, necessitating major liver resection and/or rendering liver resection unfeasible. A series of new technologies have been developed to optimise HCC management. Stem cell therapy improves impaired liver functional reserve prior to liver resection. Intravascular radiofrequency ablation recanalises the portal vein invaded by tumour thrombus and endobiliary radiofrequency ablation restores and extends biliary patency of the bile duct invaded by malignancy. Laparoscopic radiofrequency assisted liver resection minimizes blood loss and avoids liver warm ischemia, while increasing parenchymal sparing. These benefits combined maximize the safety of liver resection."

A 55-year-old lady presented with a 24-hour history of vomiting and rigors 10 months after a radical total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction for a gastric adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) showed a complete small bowel obstruction and a mesenteric swirl sign, indicating a possible internal hernia. The entire small bowel was found at laparotomy to have migrated through the mesenteric defect adjacent to the site of the previous jejunojejunostomy and was dark purple and aperistaltic. The small bowel was reduced through the defect. At a second laparotomy, the small bowel looked healthy and the defect was repaired. Postoperative recovery was unremarkable. Of numerous signs described, the mesenteric swirl sign is considered the best indicator on CT of an internal hernia following Roux-en-Y reconstruction in gastric bypass surgery.

These complications include intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation with fistula formation or abscess, free perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding, urologic complications, cancer, and perianal disease. In these cases, operative therapy should be directed to the specific indication for surgery, resecting only the segment of bowel involved in the complicating process while preserving as much bowel length as possible in order to prevent short-bowel syndrome.

A review of the first 29 MIPS procedures for malignant and premalignant tumors of the pancreas with the aid of a sterilizeable robotically-controlled camera holder was undertaken. As opposed to other robots currently available, this device allows for hand-assistance by the operating surgeon. Fourteen minimally invasive distal pancreatectomies (MIDP) (10 laparoscopic, 3 hand-assisted, 1 converted to open), 13 MIPDs (6 laparoscopic, 5 hand-assisted, 2 converted to open), and 2 laparoscopic central pancreatectomies have been performed. Seventeen (59%) of these patients were treated for cancer. Of these, 11 underwent a MIPD and 6 a MIDP. There were postoperative complications in seven patients (24%) at 30 days. Thirty and 90 day mortality was 3%.

Gynecologic examination did not show the clue of PID and in the analysis of ascites, low SAAG, predominant lymphocyte count and high level of adenosine deaminase were noted. Although the best impression was tuberculous peritonitis on the base of these findings, the laparoscopic finding was consistent with PID and the PCR for C. trachomatis infection in cervical swab was positive.

CD009323,0,21808595,0,Local resection by combined laparoendoscopic surgery for duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor.,"Combined laparoendoscopic surgery is a novel surgical method which consists of both endoscopic surgery from inside the gastrointestinal tract and laparoscopic surgery from the outside. We report a case of duodenal GIST, in which combined laparoendoscopic local resection was attempted. The lesion was resected endoscopically using endoscopic submucosal dissection technique under laparoscopic assistance. Laparoscope was used for originating the orientation of the tumor, intra-operative EUS, and monitoring serosal injury from the peritoneal cavity. Postoperative hemorrhage occurred; however, precise orientation of the lesion helped us to manage the patient with minimal invasive reoperation. And thus, the bowel integrity was completely preserved, by avoiding segmental duodenal resection and pancreaticoduodenectomy. This novel, less invasive surgical procedure may become an attractive option for the lesions originating in the anatomically challenging portion of the GI tract for endoscopic or laparoscopic surgery alone."

Using a laparoscopic approach, a slightly asymmetric and hypertrophied pylorus was visualized. The unusual age of presentation and appearance of the pylorus led to the decision to perform an open exploration for suspicion of a pyloric duplication. An incision of the pyloric muscle exposed and confirmed a duplication cyst. Further exposure revealed accessory pancreatic tissue communicating from the cyst to the main body of the pancreas. The duplication cyst and accessory pancreas were resected, and the patient had an uneventful recovery. Pyloric duplication is a rare cause of congenital extrinsic obstruction in the newborn. Even rarer is a communication of the duplication cyst with the pancreas. Resection of the duplication cyst and the aberrant pancreatic tissue and duct is recommended."

CD009323,0,21691916,0,Laparoscopic resection of small bowel lipoma causing obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.,"Small bowel lipomas are rare gastrointestinal benign neoplasms, whose signs and symptoms are often obscure. When symptoms are clinically present, one of the most common is usually gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. It is very difficult to make a precise preoperative diagnosis in the absence of evident signs. Definitive diagnosis can only be made through histopathological examination, after the surgical resection. We report a case of obscure and persistent GI bleeding in a 78-year-old woman. Through the combination of endoscopy and computed tomography (CT), it was possible to identify a small bowel lesion, being its direct cause. CT showed a certain fat component within the mass pinpointing the hypothesis of a lipoma. We then performed a laparoscopic resection of 21 cm of the middle jejunum, including the mass and an intussusception. The results of the subsequent histopathological examination of the resected specimen allowed us to conclude that the lesion was an intestinal lipoma.

Ten patients with pancreatic cancer underwent laparoscopic pancreatic resection, including pancreaticoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy in our institution. Eight of the 10 patients recovered without any complications and were discharged on the 10-29th postoperative day. The remaining 2 patients developed pancreatic fistula and were discharged on the 46 and 60th postoperative day, respectively. All lesions were well clear of surgical margins in 6 patients (R0). In the remaining 4 patients, microscopic neoplastic change was found at the surgical margin (R1). Those 4 patients developed tumor recurrence, including liver metastases or peritoneal dissemination, and 3 of the 4 died of the primary disease. Although experience is limited, laparoscopic pancreatic resection of pancreatic cancer can be feasible, safe, and effective in carefully selected patients.

CD009323,0,21683190,0,Robotic lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (Puestow).,"A lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (LPJ), also known as the Puestow procedure, is a complex procedure performed for chronic pancreatitis when the pancreatic duct is dilated and unable to drain properly. Traditionally, these procedures are performed with open surgery. A minimally invasive approach to the LPJ using rigid handheld nonarticulating instruments is tedious and rarely performed. In fact, there are no prior laparoscopic case reports for LPJ in children and only a small handful of cases in the adult literature. This lack of laparoscopic information may be an indication of the difficulty in performing this complex operation with nonarticulating laparoscopic instruments. The advantages of robotic surgery may help overcome these difficulties. We present the first robotic LPJ ever reported in a 14-year-old child with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis. This case demonstrates the utility of this advanced surgical technology and may lead to a new minimally invasive option for both adults and children with chronic pancreatitis requiring surgical intervention."

Intraoperative laparoscopic biliary ultrasonography (IOUS) allows identification of portal structures before division of any structure, but the impact of IOUS on LC for acute biliary disease has not been clearly reported. A retrospective review was conducted of all patients who underwent cholecystectomy over a 29-month period. IOUS was performed after release of the medial and lateral peritoneal attachments of the gallbladder. Of the 65 patients, 43 (66%) had an urgent operation. Mean operative time was 89.6 minutes (range 45 to 196 minutes). IOUS was used routinely, when available, in 50 patients (77%). The biliary anatomy was completely observed in 48 patients (96%). IOUS identified significant biliary abnormalities in 20 patients (40%) including presence of a foreshortened cystic duct (CD) (<1 cm) in 7 patients (14%), common bile duct stones in 4 patients (8%), abnormal CD anatomy in 4 patients (8%), and abnormal vascular anatomy in 8 patients (16%).

In clinical routine, we moved from intralumenal surgery toward surgery in the perirectal area and finally the free abdomen. In the context of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery, we have modified the length and diameter of optics and tube and developed new mechanisms for steering long curved instruments. This technology is then used for transvaginal cholecystectomy and transanal rectosigmoid resection. Global clinical application of transanal endoscopic microsurgery has proven superiority in preciseness and clinical results for adenomas and early cancer.

CD009323,0,21640474,0,Laparoscopic ultrasound enhances diagnosis and localization of insulinoma in pancreatic head and neck for laparoscopic surgery with satisfactory postsurgical outcomes.,"This study explored the value of laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) for tumor localization in laparoscopic pancreatic surgery of insulinomas, especially for tumors located at anatomically unfavorable positions. Twenty-eight patients with insulinomas were enrolled in this study between July 2007 and March 2009. Various image examinations were performed preoperatively. An iU22 ultrasound system equipped with a 5.0-9.0 MHz transducer was used for LUS. The tumor localization and postsurgical outcomes were evaluated. Intraoperative LUS precisely localized 33 insulinomas in 26 of 28 patients, whereas the preoperative imaging studies detected 27 of 33 (82%) tumors. No definite tumor in the pancreas and extra-pancreatic organs was identified in two patients by both preoperative and intraoperative imaging examinations. Of 33 tumors, 32 (97%) were localized in the pancreas (14 in the head and neck, 18 in the body and tail), whereas one (3%) was found in the duodenal ligament. Successful laparoscopic resection of insulinoma was performed in 21 of 26 patients, including resection of 11 tumors located in the head and neck of the pancreas. Five patients required conversion to open surgery. All insulinomas were benign with a mean size 13.8 mm. Four patients had pancreatic-related complications that spontaneously healed within 3 weeks after surgery. The median hospital stay was 8.5 days. Our study demonstrates that laparoscopic pancreatic resection under the guidance of advanced LUS is not only feasible and safe for tumors located at the body and tail but also for tumors located at the head and neck of the pancreas."

The two-layer method (TLM) is one of several cold storage solutions that seeks to preserve organs and cells avoiding in vivo and in vitro ischemia. We compared the retrieval of beta-like elements from exocrine pancreatic cells using TLM versus University of Wisconsin (UW) solutions. For this purpose pancreata laparoscopically harvested from 20 female pigs were preserved in UW solution or TLM before digestion. The resulting exocrine cells were divided into 2 groups: the first was cultured in a designed medium to allow differentiation into beta-like cells and the second was cryopreserved before the differentiation process at -196 °C for 8 weeks before culture in the same medium. The results revealed that TLM was better than UW as a preservation solution in terms of beta-cell viability and insulin secretion. We suggest that the use of TLM solution allows one to obtain less damaged cells for research purposes.

CD009323,0,21611948,0,Establishment of pure NOTES procedure using a conventional flexible endoscope: review of six cases of gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors.,"An increasing number of reports have recently been published on hybrid natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). These reports do not address how to complete an operation with a flexible endoscope alone (pure NOTES), but rather how to combine use of an endoscope and a laparoscope. Surgical procedures using flexible and rigid endoscopes have been developed using different processes and concepts. Recognizing this conceptual difference, we conducted a study to address how to establish a pure NOTES procedure. Six patients with gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) underwent hybrid NOTES. Each case was retrospectively reviewed to determine the appropriateness of the treatment and the usefulness of the endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) method, double-scope method, spaced perforation method, duodenal balloon occlusion method, and loop clip technique.

Over the past decade, modest advances have been made in addressing the fundamental challenges of NOTES surgery including transluminal access and closure techniques, and advancement of NOTES-specific technology. Despite these encouraging initial efforts significant obstacles to widespread acceptance of NOTES as a surgical option persist. Moreover, due to the well-documented safety and efficacy of laparoscopic techniques, the question remains as to the best candidate NOTES procedure. Presently, interest has shifted from true NOTES to hybrid procedures and single incision laparoscopic surgery, due to the lure of more immediate success. Additionally, there is also a growing awareness of the potential applications of natural orifice surgery techniques to the present field of therapeutic endoscopy. Research into transluminal access and closure has born several techniques and devices that are now being explored in endoscopic procedures such as full-thickness resection, endoscopic myotomy, direct endoscopic pancreatic necrosectomy and bariatric endoscopy.

We describe a patient with biliary obstruction due to a huge simple hepatic cyst treated with laparoscopic resection. A 60-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital because of a nontender mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Laboratory tests revealed the following: serum total bilirubin, 0.6 mg/dL; serum aspartate aminotransferase, 100 IU/L; serum alanine aminotransferase, 78 IU/L; serum alkaline phosphatase, 521 IU/L; and serum gamma glutamic transpeptidase, 298 IU/L. Abdominal computed tomography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a huge hepatic cyst, 13 cm in diameter, at the hepatic hilum, accompanied by dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct and obstruction of the common bile duct. We diagnosed biliary obstruction due to a huge hepatic cyst at the hepatic hilum, and laparoscopic surgery was performed. A huge hepatic cyst was seen at the hepatic hilum. After needle puncture of the huge cyst, the anterior wall of the cyst was unroofed, and cholecystectomy was done. Intraoperative cholangiography through a cystic duct revealed stenosis of the duct. Subsequent decapsulation of the cyst was performed in front of the common bile duct. After this procedure, cholangiography revealed that the stenosis of the common bile duct had resolved. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the hepatic cyst was benign. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the results of liver function tests normalized. The patient was discharged 7 days after operation. Computed tomography 3 months after operation revealed disappearance of the hepatic cyst and no dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct."

Reports to suggest that laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is feasible and safe have been increasingly published. Robotic surgical system has been introduced and is expected to provide unique advantages in laparoscopic surgery. However, robot-assisted pancreatic surgery has not yet been performed by many surgeons. A 45-year-old female patient with abdominal discomfort was found to have pancreatic cyst in the body of the pancreas. Mucinous cystic tumor of the pancreas was the most favourable preoperative diagnosis. She underwent spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy by using da Vinci surgical robot system. Splenic artery and vein were so tightly adherent to the pancreatic cyst that segmental resection of splenic vessels was required. Postoperative course was uneventful. She was able to come home in 5 days after surgery. Postoperative follow up color doppler ultrasound scan, taken on 2 weeks after surgery, showed minimal fluid collection around surgical field and no evidence of splenic infarction with good preservation of splenic perfusion. Robot-assisted spleen preserving distal pancreatectomy is thought to be feasible and safe. Several unique advantages of robotic system are expected to enhance safer and more precise surgical performance in near future. More experiences are mandatory to confirm real benefit of robot surgery in pancreatic disease."

However, late complications after definitive surgery develop occasionally, including intrahepatic stones and cholangitis, because of bile stasis resulting from anastomotic stricture, intrahepatic bile duct stricture, and remnants of intrahepatic ductal dilatation. In type IV-A choledochal cysts in particular, biliary stricture is frequently observed around the hepatic hilum, and ductoplasty for stricture is necessary.

It tends to disseminate early via lymphatic, peritoneal, endobiliary, and hematogenous pathways. Diagnosis is made intra-operatively in only a quarter of cases, by examination of the opened cholecystectomy specimen in the operating room by the surgeon; this procedure should be routine. For incidentally-discovered cancers, survival was 28% at five years. Prognostic factors include age, TNM stage, gallbladder perforation during cholecystectomy and less-than-optimal resection at re-operation. Whether the laparoscopic route for the initial cholecystectomy has an impact on survival remains a subject of debate. R0 surgery is the only potentially curative treatment: simple cholecystectomy with clear margins is adequate resection for stage T1a tumors; extended cholecystectomy with lymphadenectomy and possibly resection of the bile duct is required for more advanced stages. After curative resection, neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not, so far, proven effective. Improvement of surgical practices (systematic review of cholecystectomy specimens in the OR, prevention of gallbladder perforation with bile spillage during surgery, early re-intervention for optimal resection) could improve the prognosis of these cancers."

Leakage from an injured duct of Luschka (subvesical duct) follows the cystic duct as the most common cause of postcholecystectomy bile leaks. Although endoscopic sphincterotomy, plastic-stent placement, or nasobiliary-drain placement are effective in healing biliary leaks, in patients in whom leakage persists and the symptoms worsen despite conventional endoscopic treatment, re-exploration with laparoscopy and ligation of the injured subvesical duct should be considered. We present herein the case of a 31-year-old woman with refractory bile leakage from a disrupted subvesical duct after cholecystectomy that could not be managed with endoscopic sphincterotomy and plastic-stent placement. A newly designed, fully covered, self-expandable metal stent (FC-SEMS) was successfully placed for the treatment of refractory bile leaks in this patient.

CD009323,0,21448834,0,[Biliary diseases - new insights and developments].,"This article focuses on the new insights and developments in biliary tract disorders. In patients with large bile duct stones, balloon dilation after the after endoscopic sphincterotomy appears to be an effective alternative to mechanical lithotripsy. A 2-month biliary stenting reduces stone size and number of stones. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with cholezysto- and choledocholithiasis appears to be safe and might prevent biliary complications in the period following sphincterotomy. A bile sample collected during cholangiography for microbiological analysis is a simple, potentially valuable, diagnostic tool in patients with cholangitis. Each center should recognize its own patterns of infection to ensure ideal targeted therapy. In patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), development of fatigue is an independent risk factor of increased mortality. The risk of osteoporosis is increased in women with PBC and their risk of fracture increased significantly already at a T-score lower than -1.5. For PBC-patients not responding on UDCA-therapy, fenofibrate may be a new therapeutic approach. The incidence of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) increases significantly in Scandinavia. In PSC patients with dominant stenosis the additional presence of inflammatory bowel disease is associated with an increased risk of cancer and a decreased survival. The risk of osteoporosis in PSC patients is significantly increased, especially in those with long-standing inflammatory bowel disease. In patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma, bilateral stenting of the bile ducts is associated with better prognosis. The combination therapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin is an appropriate option for the treatment of patients with advanced biliary cancer."

Of the 911 patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria, 664 underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and 247 underwent laparoscopic colonic resection. No intra-operative or post-operative bleeding related to absorbable clip use occurred in either procedure. No bile duct injuries or cystic duct leakages were observed. There were no peri-operative deaths with either procedure. In this experience, absorbable clips demonstrated easy handling and high reliability. They provided safe hemostasis and permitted complete and adequate oncologic resection."

CD009323,0,21390138,0,State-of-the-art imaging techniques in endoscopic ultrasound.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has recently evolved through technological improvement of equipment, with a major clinical impact in digestive and mediastinal diseases. State-of-the-art EUS equipment now includes real-time sono-elastography, which might be useful for a better characterization of lesions and increased accuracy of differential diagnosis (for e.g. lymph nodes or focal pancreatic lesions). Contrast-enhanced EUS imaging is also available, and is already being used for the differential diagnosis of focal pancreatic masses. The recent development of low mechanical index contrast harmonic EUS imaging offers hope for improved diagnosis, staging and monitoring of anti-angiogenic treatment. Tridimensional EUS (3D-EUS) techniques can be applied to enhance the spatial understanding of EUS anatomy, especially for improved staging of tumors, obtained through a better assessment of the relationship with major surrounding vessels. Despite the progress gained through all these imaging techniques, they cannot replace cytological or histological diagnosis. However, real-time optical histological diagnosis can be achieved through the use of single-fiber confocal laser endomicroscopy techniques placed under real-time EUS-guidance through a 22G needle. Last, but not least, EUS-assisted natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) procedures offer a whole new area of imaging applications, used either for combination of NOTES peritoneoscopy and intraperitoneal EUS, but also for access of retroperitoneal organs through posterior EUS guidance."

CD009323,0,21374729,0,Accessory spleens at autopsy.,"Accessory spleens (AS) may be formed during embryonic development when some of the cells from the developing spleen are deposited along the path from the midline, where the spleen forms, over to its final location on the left side of the abdomen. An accessory spleen is usually near the spleen's hilum, but it may be embedded partly or wholly in the tail of the pancreas. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and distribution of AS during routine forensic autopsies. AS were investigated in 720 consecutive autopsy cases. Fifty-four AS were found in 48 (6.7%) cases. AS were found in hilum of the main spleen in 28 cases, the great omentum in 13 cases, the pancreas in 5 cases, and the pelvis in 2 cases. There were two AS in two cases and three AS in another two cases. Awareness of the possible presence of AS is important because when splenectomy is performed for some conditions such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura, failure to remove the AS may result in the failure of the condition to resolve. Additionally, during medical imaging, AS may be confused for enlarged lymph nodes or neoplastic growths. In conclusion, autopsy series are useful for determining the incidences and the other features of AS in different populations, in addition to those studies using CT scans and those studies obtained during laparoscopic or open surgeries."

A 21-year-old male patient had suffered from hypoglycemia episodes for 3 years and was diagnosed to have insulinoma based on biochemical and endocrinological evaluations. Various localization approaches revealed a distinct tumor outside the pancreas. With intraoperative endoscopy, the tumor in duodenohepatic ligament was identified and successfully resected. Pathologic evaluation revealed an ectopic insulinoma with ectopic pancreas. Therefore, when the biochemically confirmed insulinoma could not be well-definitely localized, the possibility of ectopic insulinoma should be suspected. In addition, radiography examinations and operation exploration should extend to the field where ectopic pancreas usually presents."

However, quality of life after either total or proximal gastrectomy is not so satisfactory. The authors report a novel surgical procedure, laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy (LAsTG), by which a very small remnant stomach is preserved, for the surgery of selected EGCs in the upper stomach. Twenty-three patients with EGC in the upper stomach underwent LAsTG. After lymph node dissection and mobilization of the stomach, the stomach was transected about 2 cm proximal to the tumor and a very small remnant stomach was preserved. An anvil was inserted transorally into the remnant stomach by using the OrVil system. The reconstruction method was Roux-en-Y, and hemidouble-stapling gastrojejunostomy with a circular stapler was performed intracorporeally. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery. Mean operation time and blood loss were 266.7 min and 54.6 ml, respectively. The overall incidence of early postoperative complications was 17.4%, and two patients underwent reoperation because of duodenal stump leakage and stenosis of the Y-anastomosis, respectively. During the follow-up period, two patients experienced gastrojejunostomy stenosis and both were treated successfully by endoscopic balloon dilation. LAsTG may be performed in selected patients with EGC in the upper stomach. With the described method, a very small remnant stomach can be preserved."

A 63-year-old woman underwent surgery for a clear cell adenocarcinoma of the ovary and received adjuvant chemotherapy. Eighteen months after the operation, she presented with recurrent occult bowel hemorrhage without evidence of an abdominal mass. Nine months later, a rapidly growing abdominal mass was detected. Laparoscopy revealed a solitary tumor of the ileum covered with an intact serosal layer. Partial ileectomy was performed for tumor resection. Histological examination revealed cells resembling the primary ovarian tumor in the mucosal surface of the small bowel along with an intact serosa. The tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 7 and negative for cytokeratin 20, suggesting an ovarian origin.

Typical symptoms can be observed only in 30% of patients. From among all diagnostic procedures angiography of branches of the coeliac trunk seems to be the most important due to it's potentially therapeutic value in case of performing TAE. Actually treatment of haemobilia depends on patient's general condition, tumor localization and size, and intensity of bleeding. TAE should be considered in all cases of haemobilia. Surgery should be performed in cases of haemobilia caused by small, resectable neoplastic tumors.

I describe a new procedure my colleagues and I devised to achieve parenchymatous hemostasis using electrocautery greased with lidocaine gel. After achieving good results in experimental studies and obtaining approval from our ethics committee, we used electrocautery greased with lidocaine gel for hemostasis in the following 36 procedures: multisegmental hepatectomy to remove hepatic tumors (n = 6); partial hepatectomy to allow hepatojejunostomy for intrahepatic biliary obstruction (n = 10); laparoscopic liver biopsy (n = 4); subtotal splenectomy (n = 8; for portal hypertension in 5 patients, splenic ischemia in 2, and Gaucher's disease in 1); laparoscopic splenic biopsy (n = 1); and bone resection (n = 7; as pelvic-femoral resection in 6 patients and to remove a rectal tumor invading the coccyx in 1). This procedure was easy to perform and achieved complete hemostasis of the minor blood vessels in all patients. No postoperative bleeding occurred and the follow-up course was satisfactory.

CD009323,0,21249684,0,Laparoscopic versus Open surgery for small bowel Crohn's disease.,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that most commonly involves the terminal ileum and colon (55 percent). Surgical treatment is required in approximately 70 percent of patients. Multiple procedures and repeat operations are required in 30 - 70 percent of all patients (Duepree 2002) but the disease remains incurable.Laparoscopy has gained wide acceptance in gastrointestinal surgery with potential advantages of faster return to normal activity and diet, reduced hospital stay, reduced postoperative pain, better cosmesis (Duepree 2002, Dunker 1998, Milsom 2001, Reissman 1996), improved social and sexual interaction (Albaz 2000) and its use is accepted in benign and malignant colorectal diseases. Laparoscopic surgery offers additional advantage of smaller abdominal fascial wounds, low incidence of hernias, and decreased rate of adhesive small-bowel obstruction (Albaz 2000) compared with conventional surgery reducing the need for non-disease-related surgical procedures in CD population.There are concerns about missing occult segments of disease and critical proximal strictures due to limited tactile ability, earlier recurrence due to possible reduced immune response induced by laparoscopy, technical difficulty due to fragile inflamed bowel and mesentery and the existence of adhesions, fistulas, and abscesses (Uchikoshi 2004).

We herein report a 56-year-old Japanese woman who was pointed out to have a space occupying lesion in the left lateral segment of the liver. Hepatitis viral-associated antigen/antibody was negative and liver function tests including lactic dehydrogenase, peripheral blood count, tumor markers and soluble interleukin-2 receptor were all within normal limit. Imaging study using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were not typical for hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, or other metastatic cancer. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography examination integrated with computed tomography scanning showed high standardized uptake value in the solitary lesion in the liver. Under a diagnosis of primary liver neoplasm, laparoscopic-assisted lateral segmentectomy was performed. Liver tumor of maximal 1.0 cm in diameter was consisted of aggregation of lymphocytes of predominantly B-cell, containing multiple lymphocyte follicles positive for CD10 and bcl-2, consistent with a diagnosis of HPL rather than MALT lymphoma, although a definitive differentiation was pending. The background liver showed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/early non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The patient is currently doing well with no sign of relapse 13 months after the surgery. Since the accurate diagnosis is difficult, laparoscopic approach would provide a reasonable procedure of diagnostic and therapeutic advantage with minimal invasiveness for patients.

CD009323,0,21224799,0,Update on laparoscopic pancreatectomy in 2010.,"Minimally invasive surgery has been proven to be a safe and effective method of surgically managing several gastrointestinal conditions. In the last ten years, increased expertise in laparoscopic surgery and the availability of new surgical devices have contributed to the development of laparoscopic pancreatic surgery. Currently, distal pancreatectomies for benign/low-grade malignant tumors represent the majority of pancreatic resections performed laparoscopically. They are characterized by improved postoperative short-term outcomes compared to open surgery. Pancreaticoduodenectomy still represents a formidable technical challenge for laparoscopy. However, laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy has been proven to be safe and feasible with outcomes comparable to those of open surgery if performed at experienced centers. Robotic surgery, recently introduced in the field of minimally invasive surgery, improves the view and the maneuverability of the instruments compared to standard laparoscopic surgery. The feasibility and safety of robotic pancreatectomy have been recently reported for complex pancreatic resection. This approach has the potential to bridge the gap between minimally invasive surgery and complex pancreatic surgery, allowing the indications for minimally invasive pancreatic surgery to be extended. Almost 15 years after its description, laparoscopic pancreatic surgery is seeing an exponential growth in its applications. The growing experience in laparoscopy and the introduction of robotics will further expand the field of minimally invasive pancreatic surgery in the next several years."

Despite its peculiar histological characteristics it can still be confused with interrelated differential diagnosis like inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT) or solitary fibrous tumours. The clinical differential diagnosis is however much wider. To date seven cases of multiple peritoneal CFTs are on record. The authors present a case discovered incidentally during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with no previous history and no radiological diagnosis achieved despite having undergone magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and normal routine perioperative investigation. The patient is disease-free 12 months after diagnosis. The case report is followed by a detailed literature review."

CD009323,0,22678942,0,Insulinoma presenting as postprandial hypoglycaemia.,"Although insulinoma commonly presents as fasting hypoglycaemia it can rarely present as postprandial hypoglycaemia. We describe a case of insulinoma presenting as postprandial hypoglycaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A 60-year-old man presented with a 6 year history of postprandial hypoglycaemic symptoms. A diagnosis of T2DM was made using a standard oral glucose tolerance test to which patient's postprandial hypoglycaemia was attributed. He was given dietetic advice for postprandial hypoglycaemia and was followed up routinely. After 2 years, hypoglycaemic symptoms worsened by exercise and delayed meals. A number of supervised fasting glucose measurements failed to demonstrate biochemical hypoglycaemia. His insulin, c-peptide and pro-insulin levels were mildly elevated but plasma glucose levels were normal. A CT scan showed 20 mm lesion in the pancreas which was confirmed as insulinoma with pancreatic arterial calcium stimulation studies. Laparoscopic resection confirmed benign insulinoma and hypoglycaemia resolved. Our case illustrates the importance of considering insulinoma as a cause of postprandial hypoglycaemia."

CD009323,0,21186005,0,Surgical management of congenital hyperinsulinism of infancy.,"Congenital hyperinsulinism of infancy (CHI) is characterized by inappropriate insulin secretion resulting in persistent hypoglycemia, which can lead to irreversible severe neurological damage in the infant. Many patients with CHI will respond to medical therapy, but surgery is necessary in those that do not. There are 2 main histologic subtypes, diffuse and focal, both of which may require different surgical strategies. Near-total pancreatectomy is the procedure of choice for diffuse CHI, whereas a localized resection is curative in focal CHI. Open surgery is the traditional approach to pancreatic resection. However, laparoscopy is increasingly used, particularly in localized resection for focal disease. We describe both methods of pancreatectomy."

CD009323,0,21181472,0,Laparoscopic liver resection.,"More than 3,000 laparoscopic liver resections (LLR) are performed worldwide for benign disease, malignancy, and living donor hepatectomy. Minimally invasive hepatic resection approaches include pure laparoscopic, hand-assisted laparoscopic, and a laparoscopic-assisted open ""hybrid"" approach, where the operation is started laparoscopically to mobilize the liver and begin the dissection, followed by a small laparotomy for completion of the parenchymal transection. Surgeons should have an advanced understanding of hepatic anatomy, extensive experience in open liver surgery, and technical skill to control major vascular and biliary structures laparoscopically before embarking on LLR. Although there is no absolute size criterion, smaller, peripheral lesions (<5 cm) that lie far from major vessels and anticipated transection planes are most amenable to LLR. Although the majority of reported LLR are non-anatomic resections or segmentectomies, several surgical groups are now performing laparoscopic major hepatic resections with excellent safety profiles. Patient benefits from LLR include less operative blood loss, less postoperative pain and narcotic requirement, and a shorter length of hospital stay, with comparable postoperative morbidity and mortality to open liver resection. Comparison studies between LLR and open resection have revealed no differences in width of resection margins for malignant lesions or overall survival after resection for hepatocellular cancer or colorectal cancer liver metastases. Advantages of LLR for HCC in particular include avoidance of collateral vessel ligation, decreased postoperative hepatic insufficiency, and fewer postoperative adhesions, all of which are features that enhance subsequent liver transplantation."

CD009323,0,21175495,0,Endoscopic occlusion of cystic duct using N-butyl cyanoacrylate for postoperative bile leakage.,"Bile leak after cholecystectomy is well described, with the cystic duct remnant the site of the leak in the majority of cases. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with biliary stent placement has a high success rate in such cases. When ERCP fails, options include surgery, and percutaneous and endoscopic transcatheter occlusion of the site of bile leak. Here, we describe a case of endoscopic transcatheter occlusion of a persistent cystic duct bile leak after cholecystectomy using N-butyl cyanoacrylate glue. A 51-year-old man had persistent pain and bilious drainage following a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The bile leak persisted after endoscopic placement of a biliary stent for a confirmed cystic duct leak. A repeat ERCP was carried out and the cystic duct was occluded with a combination of angiographic coils and N-butyl cyanoacrylate glue. The patient's pain and bilious drainage resolved. A follow-up cholangiogram confirmed complete resolution of the cystic duct leak and a patent common bile duct."

CD009323,0,21160842,0,Extent of surgical resections for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.,"Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) can involve the main pancreatic duct (MD-IPMNs) or its secondary branches (BD-IPMNs) in a segmental of multifocal/diffuse fashion. Growing evidence indicates that BD-IPMNs are less likely to harbour cancer and in selected cases these lesions can be managed non operatively. For surgery, clarification is required on: (1) when to resect an IPMN; (2) which type of resection should be performed; and (3) how much pancreas should be resected. In recent years parenchyma-sparing resections as well as laparoscopic procedures have being performed more frequently by pancreatic surgeons in order to decrease the rate of postoperative pancreatic insufficiency and to minimize the surgical impact of these operations. However, oncological radicality is of paramount importance, and extended resections up to total pancreatectomy may be necessary in the setting of IPMNs. In this article the type and extension of surgical resections in patients with MD-IPMNs and BD-IPMNs are analyzed, evaluating perioperative and long-term outcomes. The role of standard and parenchyma-sparing resections is discussed as well as different strategies in the case of multifocal neoplasms."
CD009323,0,21154206,0,[Unresectable pancreatic cancer--palliative interventional and surgical treatment].,"In most cases pancreatic cancer appears in a non-curatively resectable stage at time the diagnosis is made. Thus, palliative treatment concepts come to the fore in these patients. Patients without metastases, but presenting with marginally resectable or locally non-resectable tumours should not be treated in a palliative therapeutic scheme. These patients should be enrolled in neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy trials. After finishing treatment and restaging, a potentially curative resection can be achieved in approximately one-third of these patients. Within the scope of the best possible palliative care, excision of metastases together with resection of the primary cancer represents a therapeutic option to be contemplated in selected cases. For distinct locally unresectable or metastasised advanced pancreatic cancer, treatment of bile duct or duodenal obstruction is an essential part of the comprehensive palliative therapy. However, both endoscopic / percutaneous stenting procedures and surgical bypass makeshifts constitute safe and highly effective therapeutic alternatives in this context. In the case of operative drainage of the biliary tract the prophylactic creation of a gastro-intestinal bypass (double bypass) is recommended. The decision on a surgical versus an endoscopic procedure for palliation depends considerably on the tumour stage and the estimated prognosis and has to be determined interdisciplinary and individually in each case."
CD009323,0,21150413,0,"The prevention of major bile duct injures in laparoscopic cholecystectomy: the experience with 13,000 patients in a single center.","Major bile duct injury (MBDI) is one of the most serious complications associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). This study reports our experience in preventing MBDI during LC. Between September 1991 and August 2004, 13,000 cases of LC were performed at Kunming General Hospital. Systemic strategies, including selection of proper patients for LC based on the surgeons' experience, dissection techniques in Calot's triangle, selective use of laparoscopic ultrasonography, and indication of conversion to an open approach were developed and introduced to avoid MBDI. In our series, the overall incidence of MBDI was 0.085%, 0.60% (3 of 500) over the first period from September 1991 to September 1992, 0.17% (5 of 3000) over the second period from October 1992 to September 1996, and 0.03% (3 of 9500) over the third period from October 1996 to August 2004. The MBDI included transection of the common bile duct (CBD) due to mistaking CBD for cystic duct (n=6), cautery injury (n=3), laceration of the CBD at the junction of cystic duct and CBD (n=1), and clip partially of common hepatic duct due to blind hemostasis (n=1). The incidence of MBDI in our institution is acceptable. We believe the system strategies are effective to avoid MBDI in LC. LC is a safe procedure with an incidence of biliary injury comparable with that for open cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,21150408,0,Laparoscopic resection of ileal lipoma diagnosed by multidetector-row computed tomography.,"Intussusception is rare in adults and it is difficult to diagnose on admission. We present the case of a 43-year-old woman with the chief complaint of nausea and upper abdominal pain. Abdominal multidetector-row computed tomography showed ileo-ileal small bowel intussusception with an intraluminal soft tissue mass with attenuation numbers suggestive of a lipoma. The patient was treated with a laparoscopic-assisted extracorporeal partial resection of the small bowel including ileal lipoma, followed by a functional end-to-end anastomosis. Histologic diagnosis of the resected tumor, 2.4×2.0×2.0 cm, was an intestinal lipoma. This case serves as the basis of a review of small bowel intussusception in adults secondary to lipomas. It focuses on the utility of multidetector-row computed tomography and the cosmetic, physical, and economic benefits of laparoscopic surgery as well as the rarity of the disease."
CD009323,0,21150405,0,Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for a large pancreatic lymphoepithelial cyst: a rare entity.,"Lymphoepithelial cysts (LECs) of the pancreas are rare true pancreatic cysts. Their cause is not known. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes many benign and malignant cystic lesions of the pancreas and surrounding organs. A combination of imaging modalities and fine needle aspiration might narrow the differential diagnosis. However, the final diagnosis can only be achieved with certainty after resection of the cyst. In this study, we report the largest LEC of the pancreas to have been resected laparoscopically. A 43-year-old man presented with upper abdominal pain, a 7.5 cm mutlioculated cystic mass in the pancreatic body and tail on imaging, and a raised serum cancer antigen-19-9. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy was performed. Histologic examination revealed a LEC.

CD009323,0,21150399,0,Two cases of hepatocellular carcinoma located adjacent to the Glisson's capsule treated by laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation with intraductal chilled saline perfusion through an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube.,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a commonly used local therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, for tumors located adjacent to the Glisson's capsule in the hepatic hilar region, RFA may cause bile duct injury and may be difficult to perform using the standard procedure. We describe 2 HCC cases in which RFA was performed laparoscopically under general anesthesia while cooling bile ducts to prevent bile duct injury. An endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube was preoperatively inserted, through which chilled saline was rapidly infused during laparoscopic RFA for HCC adjacent to the Glisson's capsule in the hepatic hilar region. The patient was discharged from hospital without intraoperative or postoperative complications. Follow-up contrast-enhanced CT revealed complete tumor cauterization and no evidence of late bile duct stenosis. This procedure is performed under general anesthesia and, unlike those performed under local anesthesia, is associated with minimal stress to patients and minimal risk of bile duct injury."

There have been reports of laparoscopic ISR [3, 4], but discussion of the specific techniques used in this laparoscopic surgical procedure have not been sufficient. For better outcomes of this sophisticated procedure, extreme care must taken to prevent perforation of the rectal wall and to preserve the external sphincter muscle. The most difficult steps for ISR are the circular dissection and separation of the internal sphincter muscle from the external sphincter and puborectalis using the perineal approach.

CD009323,0,21128317,0,Management of mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the actual management of mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) of the pancreas. A systematic review was performed in December 2009 by consulting PubMed MEDLINE for publications and matching the key words ""pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasm"", ""pancreatic mucinous cystic tumour"", ""pancreatic mucinous cystic mass"", ""pancreatic cyst"", and ""pancreatic cystic neoplasm"" to identify English language articles describing the diagnosis and treatment of the mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. In total, 16 322 references ranging from January 1969 to December 2009 were analysed and 77 articles were identified. No articles published before 1996 were selected because MCNs were not previously considered to be a completely autonomous disease. Definition, epidemiology, anatomopathological findings, clinical presentation, preoperative evaluation, treatment and prognosis were reviewed. MCNs are pancreatic mucin-producing cysts with a distinctive ovarian-type stroma localized in the body-tail of the gland and occurring in middle-aged females. The majority of MCNs are slow growing and asymptomatic. The prevalence of invasive carcinoma varies between 6% and 55%. Preoperative diagnosis depends on a combination of clinical features, tumor markers, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic ultrasound with cyst fluid analysis, and positron emission tomography-CT. Surgery is indicated for all MCNs."
CD009323,0,21128064,0,Lymph node metastasis from undifferentiated-type mucosal gastric cancer satisfying the expanded criteria for endoscopic resection based on routine histological examination.,"A 58-year-old woman was found to have a 45-mm abdominal mass adjacent to the pancreas on screening ultrasonography, and subsequent esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a small gastric cancer (13 mm in diameter). We initially performed endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), and routine histological examination of the specimen sectioned at 2-mm intervals revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and signet ring cell carcinoma confined to the mucosa without lymphatic-vascular capillary involvement or ulceration. These findings satisfied the expanded criteria for ESD we reported recently. We next performed laparoscopic excisional biopsy of the abdominal mass, and histological examination with immunohistochemical staining revealed a metastatic lymph node (LN) resulting from the gastric cancer. Distal gastrectomy with extended lymphadenectomy was then performed and histological examination indicated no residual cancer cells or any additional LN metastases. After the above-described clinical course, further analysis was conducted because of the highly unusual nature of this case; 60 additional deep-cut sections from the resected specimen were performed, with one section showing lymphatic involvement in the mucosa on hematoxylin and eosin staining. This case suggests practical limitations in determining lymphatic involvement through routine histological examination, which may not always be able to detect LN metastasis."

CD009323,0,21103287,0,"The society for gastrointestinal intervention. Are we, as an organization of disparate disciplines, cooperative or competitive?","This is the Fourth Annual Meeting of the Society for Gastrointestinal Intervention, a multi-disciplinary group of practitioners committed to a minimally invasive approach to both the diagnosis and treatment of digestive disorders. The key concepts are minimally invasive and multi-disciplinary which can be construed as practicing in parallel with occasional lines of procedural and clinical interaction or inter-disciplinary in which patients are acutely cared for by a team, with treatments tailored to the patient and not the discipline that touches the patient first. In reality, many of us exist in both worlds. Most universities and large clinics are structured in departments along traditional training lines. As such, Interventional Radiology is housed in the Radiology Department, Laparoscopic Surgery (and potentially NOTES), as a component of the General Surgery Division, and Therapeutic Endoscopy usually resides within a gastroenterology structural framework. These divisions have historically been kept separate by multiple forces: salaries and budgets usually reside in a larger division. As a group, the amount of practice devoted to GI disorders is variable (for instance, minimally invasive surgeons may approach the adrenal glands or lung lesions in some institutions and interventional radiologists often sample tissue in multiple areas outside the GI tract, and by virtue of access to the vascular tree, can stent, embolize, or TPA almost any area of the body), as well as inherent differences in our individual abilities to access organs. I have already mentioned that angiographic capabilities allow the interventional radiologist access to virtually every GI organ and those capabilities allow therapeutic options for bleeding, tumor embolization, stenting of stenotic lesions, and formation of intravascular shunts. As such, there is very limited interdisciplinary competition here although capsule endoscopy as well as double and single balloon enteroscopy have improved the endoscopist's diagnostic and potential therapeutic reach. However, many of these diagnostic triumphs for obscure or massive GI bleed are simply to tattoo lesions that require surgical removal by laparoscopic or traditional surgery. Cooperation. However, there are potential competitive areas in the treatment of GI vascular lesions also. Whereas endoscopic band ligation has supplanted EVS, splenic devascularization, and most shunting procedures for patients with esophageal varices, endoscopic techniques have had less long-term success with glue injection for gastric varices. Multiple randomized, prospective trials have suggested therapeutic primacy of TIPS with embolization of recalcitrant vessels as an option or back-up. Despite this, therapeutic endoscopists have learned valuable lesions from our IR colleagues and studies are underway using endoscopically injected coils in addition to cyanoacrylate in an attempt to improve acute and long-term bleeding control. Nor is there any major competition in the treatment of primary or metastatic liver tumors by chemoembolization, RF current, or other thermal modalities, although selected patients with single lesions or multiple lesions isolated to a single lobe may be better handled surgically if there is curative intent. Finally, there is little IR, and progressively less, surgical competition for the treatment of high-grade dysplasia or superficial malignancies in the setting of Barrett's esophagus which are adequately treated in most patients by mucosectomy, RF ablation, or cryotherapy but require direct mucosal visualization to direct this therapy. The same has proven true for many years for colorectal polyps, superficial gastric cancers, and ampullary adenomas that had historically all been treated with major surgical resections. Still, there are many patients with advanced lesions who are good operative candidates who should be approached with conventional or minimally invasive surgery with the intent of operative cure. Cooperative, not competitive. The potential for competition between disciplines comes in mundane situations and clinical settings that have historically been ""owned"" by a single discipline. On the one hand, placement of PEGS and PEJs, initially done endoscopically, can be done with equal facility and occasional failure, by endoscopists and interventional radiologists, reserving failed attempts for minimally invasive surgery. What resources are utilized with these three methods? Are there advantages to defining the mucosa of the gut lumen in all, or even a subset of patients? By way of contrast, acute cholecystectomy tubes in high surgical risk patients have usually been the domain of the radiologist, although I described transcystic duct gallbladder decompression endoscopically 2½ decades ago. With the advent of new devices delivered under EUS control, the gallbladder will now be readily accessible endoscopically. What does this mean both for the acutely ill patient without a window to approach their gallbladder radiologically? Will this play a bit part and a cooperative technique to expand our therapeutic armamentarium or will it become competitive therapeutically not only for IR but for minimally invasive surgeons? The same may be said for EUS's ability to inject genes, caustics, or chemo-therapeutic agents into organs adjacent to the lumen. What is the role of TNFerade injection into unresectable pancreatic cancers and the role of absolute alcohol or Taxitol to treat cystic neoplasms of the pancreas? The real issue of competition or cooperation between the disciplines comes when treating patients with unresectable and obstructing GI neoplasms, from my perspective. The latter may occur almost anywhere in the GI tract but, of course, are more commonly noted proximally (esophagus, stomach, duodenum) and distally (left colon) as well as proximal and distal biliary obstructions. Recognizing that the occasional mid-small bowel and many proximal colon lesions are better handled with an endoscopic approach because of loss of vector force and difficulty pushing a catheter through large diameter, acutely angulated lumens, all others are fair game from my perspective. To my knowledge, although there are studies demonstrating the superiority of SEMS over open or laparoscopic bypass for malignant gastric outlet obstruction insofar as return of gut function, hospitalization time, and resource utilization, there are no studies demonstrating the superiority of one discipline or another in the placement of SEMS. Nor have cost data emerged suggesting the superiority of one technique over another from a cost standpoint. Unless or until we have such studies, this suggests to me that institutional interest and expertise should play a major role in how these unfortunate patients have continuity of their GI tract re-established. The situation is a bit more complex in pancreaticobiliary malignancy. There are 2 prospective randomized trials (level 1 evidence) that suggest that patients with proximal strictures (Bismuth II-IV) in conjunction with bile duct and gallbladder cancer, respectively, may be more successfully stented percutaneously and certainly it is easier to deliver brachytherapy or PDT under protocol to these patients who have indwelling external drains. In contrast, there are no data, positive or negative, to suggest that PTBD is a preferable treatment for distal biliary malignant obstruction, and in most parts of the world, the endoscopic approach has supplanted the percutaneous one just as metal stents have replaced plastic prostheses to preclude recurrent bouts of stent dysfunction and need for additional ERCP. The question posed at the beginning of this syllabus contribution: Are we competitive or cooperative? The answer is obviously both but, hopefully, our choice of treatment should depend less on who touches the patient first and more on skill sets within an institution and what is the best treatment for this particular individual. The importance of the SGI is technical and informational cross-fertilization. If your university or clinic will not allow blurring of training barriers to put therapeutic endoscopists, minimally invasive surgeons, and interventional radiologists together as a department or institute, you can nevertheless work together as a team in the best interest of your patients."

One-hundred and thirty-two patients with distal gastric cancer underwent D2 LDG with a novel sequence of lymph node dissection between August 2004 and June 2008. Live anatomy in each step was observed simultaneously to ensure and confirm the newly developed methodology. Dissections in LDG were standardized as sequential steps: Dividing the gastrocolic ligament and getting access to the prepancreatic space--lymph node dissection in the lower left area--lymph node dissection in the lower right area--lymph node dissection in the upper right area--lymph nodes dissection centrally--lymph node dissection between liver and stomach. All dissections were successfully performed in peripancreatic spaces and their extensions. Gastric vessels were located by special landmarks, traced along vascular trunks and bifurcations, and identified by fine dissection technique in vaginavasorum. Sequential dissection around the pancreas was an effective method for D2 LDG. It was ensured by anatomical knowledge in each step: Vessels and fascial spaces around a central landmark, the pancreas."

However, one major concern in using abdominal laparoscopy is missed lesions, in the past this has not been adequately explored. The aim of this retrospective study, therefore, is to evaluate cancerous lesions that are missed during emergency laparoscopic surgeries. The medical records of 2074 patients who had a laparoscopy from March 1996 to April 2006 for acute abdomen symptoms, including diagnostic laparoscopy (n = 119), laparoscopic appendectomy (n = 1336), laparoscopic duodenorrhaphy (n = 30), and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 589) were reviewed. Missed cancerous lesions included cecal cancer (n = 2), sigmoid cancer (n = 1), and jejunum lymphoma (n = 1). The incidence of missed cancerous lesions in an emergency laparoscopic surgery is 0.19%, mainly due to its lower tactile sensitivity compared to the direct hand palpation and masqueraded by inflammatory process. Therefore, careful observation is recommended for post-emergency laparoscopic patients and follow-up should be performed within three months, especially for patients with intra-abdominal and/or severe inflammation status."

The main argument in favor of this procedure is that it helps prevent a delay of chemotherapy in cases of unresectable tumors or peritoneal/lymph node metastasis. We report a technique of performing this exploration through single-incision laparoscopy. VIDEO: The umbilicus is incised, and a purse-string suture is applied. An 11-mm nondisposable trocar is inserted for a 10-mm, 30° angled scope. Curved and reusable instruments (Karl Storz-Endoskope, Tuttlingen, Germany) are inserted transumbilically. Laparoscopic exploration of the cavity allows the visualization of suspected peritoneal or lymph node metastasis. Peritoneal lavage for cytology is performed. Biopsy is accomplished through the curved shape of the instruments, which establishes the working triangulation inside the abdomen as well as externally. Laparoscopic ultrasonography of the liver and of the pancreas (after opening the lesser sac) is performed after replacement of the 11-mm trocar with a 13-mm trocar and the use of a 5-mm scope. The procedure can be continued either by laparoscopy or by open surgery. At completion, the umbilicus is meticulously closed to avoid complications."

Intraoperative US may be used for applications such as staging and localizing tumors; performing regional metastatic surveys; documenting arterial and venous patency; identifying endocrine tumors; distinguishing pancreatitis from a neoplasm; and guiding biopsy, duct cannulation, and drainage of abscesses or cysts. The scanning approach and technique vary according to the application, with many different equipment and transducer options and sterilization methods available. With increasing clinical demands for intraoperative US, it is essential that radiologists be familiar with its uses and technique. In addition, to properly perform intraoperative US and accurately interpret the images, knowledge of normal and variant pancreatic and vascular anatomy and relevant landmarks is needed.

CD009323,0,20975505,0,Revisional surgery after gastrectomy for gastric cancer: review of the literature.,"Recent reports have shown that morbidity and mortality after gastrectomy for gastric cancer vary between authors, countries, and procedures. Common complications related to gastrectomy are postoperative bleeding, anastomotic leakage, pancreatic juice leakage, intra-abdominal abscess, intestinal obstruction, wound dehiscence, and so on. Recently, laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer has developed, especially in Japan and East Asian countries because it is less invasive. Several retrospective studies have shown that the operative complication rate is similar to that of conventional open surgery. Although most postoperative complications can be successfully treated by conservative therapies, surgical management is occasionally needed to prevent a fatal outcome. This review article provides insight into how surgeons can make efforts to reduce postoperative complications through proper preoperative evaluation and improved surgical skills during the initial gastrectomy. In addition, it reviews guidance for timely revisional surgery to allow salvage of patients with serious acute operative complications based on clinical findings made by a group of experienced surgeons."

The causes of obstruction included adhesive band in 16 patients; and small bowel lymphoma, metastatic esophageal cancer, small bowel gangrene, Meckel diverticulum, gallstones ileus, and incarcerated incisional hernia in two. Using the Fisher two-sided test, no significant predictor for conversion was identified using gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, previous bowel obstruction, history of adhesiolysis, abdominal distention, pelvic surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation, malignancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, coronary artery disease, hypertension, or hypercholesterolenemia. The Wilcoxon two-sided test did not show significance for age, weight, number of previous abdominal surgeries, or small bowel diameter. The postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group compared with those who needed conversion (3 vs. 9 days) with P = 0.0019. No mortality was noted in any patients. The laparoscopic is safe and feasible for the management of SBO. We believe that the laparoscopic approach should be offered to all patients with SBO unless there is an absolute contraindication to laparoscopic surgery."

CD009323,0,20832296,0,Advances in cancer surgery: natural orifice surgery (NOTES) for oncological diseases.,"Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is a new concept that attempts to reduce the impact of surgery on the patient. In surgical oncology several studies have already revealed that a minimally invasive approach provides at least the same, if not a better, long-term outcome. One could hypothesize that a less invasive approach such as NOTES could further enhance such advantages. Since its initial description, NOTES has become clinical reality and today nearly every organ is accessible by a transluminal approach, in at least the experimental setting. Subsequent to published research, first clinical studies on NOTES in oncology were reported and the accuracy of transgastric peritoneoscopy for staging of pancreas cancer was shown to be similar to laparoscopy in humans. A NOTES gastro-jejunostomy via transgastric access has also been proposed to decrease invasiveness of palliative treatment of duodenal, biliary and pancreatic cancers. Colorectal cancer resection via transanal access would offer a clear-cut patient advantage over laparoscopic and would not be subject to the frequent criticism of violating an innocent second organ, as the colon or rectum is always breached in a colectomy. Natural orifice endoluminal therapies, such as endoscopic submucosal dissection, already have been clinically applied for several years. Improved techniques or instruments evolving from NOTES technology might enhance its widespread use for the treatment of early malignancies and thereby again will provide a tremendous benefit for the patient. Although still somewhat controversial, the subject of natural orifice surgery in oncological disease indicates that current laboratory efforts to introduce NOTES into cancer surgery could be ready for cautious clinical investigations. The final determination of patient benefit will need well-constructed prospective study."
CD009323,0,20828420,0,Indications and recommended approach for surgical intervention of metastatic disease to the gallbladder.,"Metastatic disease to the gallbladder is unusual. The most common malignancy metastatic to the gallbladder is melanoma, followed by renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and breast cancer. Due to the unusual nature of the disease, there are no trials available for review. Thus, the management for these patients has been based on institutional experience and review of case series. The indications for surgical intervention for melanoma are metastatic disease discrete to the gallbladder and biliary symptoms, which are uncommon for melanoma, but might occur due to cystic duct obstruction culminating in cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy without a lymphadenectomy is emerging as the preferred approach for this metastatic deposit. The vast majority of patients with metastases to the gallbladder from RCC carry a good prognosis and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be considered. Patients with metastases to the gallbladder from the breast classically present with biliary symptoms and commonly undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which invariably demonstrates a deposit in the gallbladder from lobular breast cancer. In the present report, we review the indications for surgical intervention from various malignancies metastatic to the gallbladder and the current consensus for the laparoscopic approach from the diverse metastatic deposits to the gallbladder."

CD009323,0,20817146,0,Hypercalcitonemia revealing a somatostatinoma.,"Somatostatinoma are rare well-differentiated endocrine tumors with malignant behavior arising from the pancreas and duodenum. They are defined by somatostatin positive immunostaining of the majority of tumor cells. The main clinical features are diabetes, diarrhea and biliary lithiasis related to somatostatin production. Somatostatinoma secreting both calcitonin and somatostatin may be unrecognized as a small number of such observations have been published. We report the case of a 57- year-old woman referred for weight loss, diarrhea and worsening diabetes. Computer tomography scan revealed multiple hypervascular liver lesions suggestive of metastases. High plasma calcitonin level was evidenced, with normal chromogranin-A value, and high plasma somatostatin results lately communicated. Calcitonin secretion of extra-thyroidal origin was suspected leading to the identification of a pancreatic mass by further multiphase CT. The patient underwent left pancreatectomy with surgical hepatic resection. Histological and immunostaining studies confirmed definitive diagnosis of somatostatinoma secreting both somatostatin and calcitonin. Plasma calcitonin should be measured in the assessment of duodeno-pancreatic endocrine neoplasm. Calcitonin determination is available, more reproducible than other specific pancreatic endocrine markers and could be effective for diagnosis and follow-up of such foregut-derived endocrine neoplasia."

We report the case of an infected pancreatic pseudocyst which was treated by surgical procedure using these useful devices. A 69-year-old man was followed up in our hospital after severe acute pancreatitis. He had undergone drainage surgeries twice for intractable pancreatic abscess followed by severe acute pancreatitis. He was admitted to our hospital complaining of loss of appetite, hiccups, and high fever. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed an infected pancreatic pseudocyst which compressed the gastric wall. Internal drainage into the stomach was performed using Lap-Protector and circular stapler. The patient recovered uneventfully.

CD009323,0,20712045,0,Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery in pancreatic diseases.,"Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is a surgical technique that has received considerable interest in recent years. Although minimal access surgery has increasingly replaced traditional open abdominal surgical approaches for a wide spectrum of indications, in pancreatic diseases its widespread use is limited to few indications because of the challenging and demanding nature of major pancreatic operations. Nonetheless, there have been attempts in animal models as well as in the clinical setting to perform diagnostic and resectional NOTES for pancreatic diseases. Here, we review and comment upon the available data regarding currently analyzed and performed pancreatic NOTES procedures. Potential indications for NOTES include peritoneoscopy, cyst drainage, and necrosectomy, palliative procedures such as gastroenterostomy, as well as resections such as distal pancreatectomy or enucleation. These procedures have already been shown to be technically feasible in several studies in animal models and a few clinical trials. In conclusion, NOTES is a rapidly developing concept/technique that could potentially become an integral part of the armamentarium dealing with surgical approaches to pancreatic diseases."

CD009323,0,20639849,0,Carcinoma gallbladder.,"Carcinoma gallbladder (CaGb) is a rare disease. The aetiology of CaGb is yet not known. However the risk of CaGb is increased in anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction (APBDJ), gall stones, xanthogranulomatus cholecystitis, calcified or porcelain gallbladder, cholelithiasis with typhoid carriers, gallbladder adenoma, red meat consumption and tobacco uses. There are protective effects of vegetables on CaGb. Most of the cases present with advanced disease. In early carcinoma of a gallbladder sign and symptoms mimic benign disease. The diagnosis is established by ultrasonography, computerized tomography and guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Biochemical tests are of very little value in making a diagnosis. The treatment depends on the clinical stage at presentation. Surgery offers the best chance of cure. In stage T1a, laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy alone is curative, and in T1b, cholecystectomy with hepatoduodenal lymph node dissection without combined resection of an adjacent organ is required. Segment S4a+5 hepatectomy combined with extrahepatic bile duct resection (BDR) and D2 lymph node dissection is a highly recommended operation for the treatment of T2 and T3 CaGb. The dye injection method is useful in determining the appropriate extent of hepatic resection for advanced CaGb. Resurgery is required only in those cases where tumour has invaded the serosa and/ or adjacent structures when diagnosed postoperatively. Biliary bypass is required for palliation.

These injuries are potentially avoidable with proper techniques and correct interpretation of the anatomy. The scope of the injury can range from a simple cystic duct leak to the injury of the left and right hepatic duct confluence. The key to successful outcomes from these injuries is to know when a referral to a specialized tertiary center is necessary. Evaluation and treatment of bile duct injuries is complex and often requires the expertise of an advanced endoscopist, interventional radiologist, and hepatobiliary surgeons. Before any planned intervention or operative repair, detailed evaluation of the biliary system and its associated vasculature is required. Better outcomes are achieved when patients are referred to centers specialized in biliary injury evaluation, treatment, and performing pretreatment planning early."

The presence of short or absent cystic duct is unusual and represents a co-factor of biliary injury especially during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Thus, its knowledge is important to avoid ductal injury in hepato-biliary surgery. We experienced the case of a 40-year-old woman with symptomatic cholelitiasis, who underwent to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. At surgery, an accidental bile duct lesion was carried, during Calot's triangle dissection, due the particular difficulties in dissecting an extremely short cystic duct found at the junction of the common hepatic duct and common bile duct. No vascular anomalies were present. The biliary leakage from the common bile duct was intraoperative identified and subsequentially treated by the endoscopic method. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with sequential biliary endoprosthesis insertion was completed without conversion to open surgery. The endoscopic stenting was the definitive treatment for the leakage. No evidence of biliary stent complication was observed during the follow-up.

The patient experienced cold sweats on fasting, received diagnosis of insulinoma, and was referred to our hospital for laparoscopic surgery. Blood biochemistry studies showed low fasting blood glucose of 42 mg/dL, serial immunoreactive insulin of 15.2 microU/mL, and a Fajans index (immunoreactive insulin/blood glucose) of 0.36 (normal <0.30). Contrast-enhanced early-phase computed tomography of the abdomen showed a circular, intensely stained, 1.6-cm-diameter tumor in the pancreatic body close to the main pancreatic duct. A solitary insulinoma of the pancreatic body was diagnosed on the basis of the result of hematologic studies, and diagnostic imaging results. Because of the location of the tumor, we elected to perform distal pancreatectomy preserving the spleen and splenic vessels, rather than enucleation. Insulin and blood glucose levels were monitored during surgery. Before removal of the tumor, insulin levels remained consistently high, never decreasing to less than 10 microU/mL. After surgery, insulin levels decreased rapidly, to less than 5 microU/mL within 30 minutes and subsequently remained at the new low level, leading us to conclude that the entire tumor had been removed. There were no postoperative complications, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on day 7. There was no major intraoperative bleeding other than at the resected surface. The patient was ambulatory soon after the procedure, and had a brief hospital stay therefore, the surgery was judged to have been highly useful in this case."

CD009323,0,20590893,0,Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery: a review of present results and future prospects.,"Pancreatic surgery is still associated with a relatively high morbidity and mortality compared with other specialties. This is a result of the complex nature of the organ, the difficult access as a result of the retroperitoneal position and the number of technically challenging anastomoses required. Nevertheless, the past two decades have witnessed a steady improvement in morbidity and a decrease in mortality achieved through alterations of technique (particularly relating to the pancreatic anastomoses) together with hormonal manipulation to decrease pancreatic secretions. Recently minimally invasive pancreatic surgery has been attempted by several centres around the world which has stimulated considerable interest in this approach. The majority of the cases attempted have been distal pancreatectomies, because of the more straightforward nature of the resection and the lack of a pancreatic ductal anastomosis, but more recently reports of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy have started to appear. The reports of the series to date have been difficult to interpret and although the results are claimed to be equivalent or better than those associated with a traditional approach a careful examination of the literature and comparison with the best results previously reported does not presently support this. In the present review we examined all the reports of pancreatic procedures performed laparoscopically and compared the results with those previously achieved at open surgery."

CD009323,0,20583448,0,Usefulness of laparoscope-assisted antrectomy for gastric carcinoids with hypergastrinemia.,"The mechanisms responsible for development of gastric carcinoid tumors (type I carcinoids) in type A atrophic gastritis are hyperplasia of enterochromaffin-like cells that are associated with hypergastrinemia, and tumorigenesis. Endoscopic resection and gastrectomy are applied as treatment modalities for gastric carcinoids associated with gastrin hypersecretion. However, since the underlying pathology is the hyperplasia of gastrin-secreting cells and over-production of gastrin in the antropyloric region, antrectomy seems a logical treatment modality. To date, we have performed laparoscopic-assisted anterectomies in 3 cases of type I gastric carcinoid. The lesions have regressed or disappeared in 2 cases, in which resections of the foci were not performed. Furthermore, no has been observed in the other case, in which laparoscopic resection was performed. A laparoscopic antrectomy for type I gastric carcinoid is a minimally invasive treatment relevant to the pathology of the disease, and it is also expected to produce regression or even spontaneous resolution of the tumor."

Metastatic neoplasms may involve the small intestine via contiguous spread, peritoneal metastases or hematogenous metastases. Because the small intestine is relatively inaccessible to routine endoscopy, diagnosis of small intestinal neoplasms is often delayed for months after onset of symptoms.

CD009323,0,20496131,0,A safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy depends upon the establishment of a critical view of safety.,"Bile duct injuries (BDI) during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) occur more frequently than during an open cholecystectomy. Many expert surgeons learn to perform procedures safely based on their experience. Above all, the critical view of safety (CVS) introduced by Strasberg in 1995 is the standard practice to prevent BDI during an LC. The CVS is achieved by clearing all fat and fibrous tissue in Calot's triangle, after which the cystic structures can be clearly identified, occluded, and divided. Failure to successfully create this view may be an indication for conversion to an open cholecystectomy. The Japan Society for Endoscopic Surgery (JSES) introduced an accreditation examination in 2004. The critical view is an important factor used to judge a safe dissection. The annual ratios of successful applicants were 63% in 2004, 45% in 2005, 36% in 2006, 39% in 2007, and 44% in 2008. Biennial questionnaire surveys by JSES show that the laparoscopic BDI rates were 0.66% in 1990-2001, 0.79% in 2002, 0.77% in 2003, 0.66% in 2004, 0.77% in 2005, 0.65% in 2006, and 0.58% in 2007. Therefore, 2007 was the first year in which the rate was below 0.6%. A decreasing BDI rate is therefore expected because successful candidates will introduce technical improvements to colleagues in their hospitals and local regions."

This surgery must fulfil a series of technical requirements so as to be really effective, as it has to be R0, with no tumour rupture, with preservation of the pseudo-capsule, etc. Although the majority of GIST are gastric, their location in other anatomical areas, such as the oesophagus, duodenum or rectum, require the surgeon to use more complex techniques. Laparoscopy is increasingly used; however, we must avoid its use, due to there being few experienced groups or if there are large tumours. The use of neoadjuvant therapy has revived great interest by allowing to resection tumours that were once non-resectable or in very compromised anatomical locations, with less aggressive surgery. The use of pre-surgical biopsy is not exempt from serious risks, thus it should only be used for establishing a neoadjuvant treatment or if there are diagnostic doubts with other diseases in high risk patients."

Common bile duct stones are a common clinical problem for which there now exist a range of treatment modalities. Official guidelines in the UK advocate the use of plastic biliary endoprostheses in the treatment of common bile duct stones only as a short-term measure prior to definitive endoscopic or surgical clearance. Long-term use of such stents is associated with several complications related to stent insertion, occlusion, and migration. Organ perforation resulting from plastic biliary stents is very rare and can occur either as an early complication at stent insertion or as a late complication resulting from stent migration and pressure necrosis. Although duodenal, small-bowel, and colonic perforations have been described, we have found no reports of extra-hepatic bile duct perforation occurring as a complication of plastic biliary stents. We present three cases of biliary tree erosion and perforation by plastic stents placed in patients with common bile duct stones cleared endoscopically prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy and discuss the possible implications of this previously unreported phenomenon."

Using an endoscopic surgical spacer (SECUREA) that we developed, we performed laparoscopic enucleation of a pancreatic tumor in a patient with pancreatic mucinous cystadenoma. The SECUREA is a polyurethane sponge with a radiopaque marker. It is elliptic-cylindrical and measures 6.5 cm on the major axis, 3.5 cm on the minor axis, and 2 cm in height. Herein, we report the intraoperative findings and examine the usefulness of SECUREA for laparoscopic enucleation. The spacer was introduced into the abdominal cavity through a 12-mm trocar, and was grasped with forceps to isolate or extend organs and tissues, thereby ensuring a safe and relatively uncontaminated surgical field. In addition, the high absorptiveness and water-holding capacity of the sponge facilitated removal of exudate, which created a clearer operative field and reduced the technical challenges of drainage manipulation. Indeed, replacement of the sponge was unnecessary because it returned to its original state after the liquid it contained had been aspirated. Our findings suggest that the SECUREA increases safety and reduces the technical difficulties of laparoscopic enucleation."

On careful assessment we suspected a mucoid cystic tumor (MCT), and performed a laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. Blood loss was 380 g, and operating time was 310 min. Case 1: A 27-year-old woman was found to have a hypoechoic 2 x 2 cm mass on ultrasound examination of the body of the pancreas. We performed laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy for solid pseudopapillary tumour (SPT) of the pancreas. Blood loss was minimal, and operating time was 182 min. The other 5 cases were operated upon using the open method. All were female, with an average age of 54.8 years. The average blood loss was 387 g. Operating time was 321 min. Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery is generally thought to be difficult owing to the need for lymph node resection, and because nerve plexus invasion occurs with malignant tumors such as pancreatic cancer. The present case series was reported to demonstrate the techniques that have evolved the safety of the operation and its future potential related to the minimally invasive nature of the surgery."

We evaluated a new technique for pancreatic stump reinforcement with synthetic glue after laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. Ten female domestic pigs were divided into 2 groups; in group A (n=5), the pancreas was transected using an EndoGIA stapler, whereas in group B (n=5), the pancreas was transected using a Ligasure device and the pancreatic stump was reinforced with a hydrogel sealant. The clinical postoperative course was uneventful in all the cases. No differences were observed in pancreatic remnant healing between the groups, and only minor microscopic alterations of the healing process were found in the groups. The technique using Ligasure transection reinforced by the hydrogel sealant seems to be comparable with the standard transection technique using the stapler."

During open cholecystectomies (OC), the prevalence of bile duct injuries has been estimated at only 0.1-0.2%. We report 3 cases of BTI during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). CASE 1: Ascalesi Hospital, Naples 2003-2007, 875 LC (BTI 0,11%). During the dissection of triangle of Calot a partial resection of biliary common duct was made. Immediately the lesion was evident and sheltered in laparoscopy, suturing with a spin reabsorbable, without biliar drainage. The post-operative outcome was good, without alteration of the some parameters, and the patient was discharged after three days. At the last follow-up (January 2006) the cholangiography didn't show stricture or leakage. CASE 2: General and Laparoscopic Surgical Unit San Giovanni di Dio Hospital Frattamaggiore 2004-2007, 720 LC (BTI 0,13%). Patient affected by cholecystitis with gallstones. The patient did not present jaundice, but abdominal pain, leucocitosis, fever and US evidence of parietal gallbladder inflammation. LC was performed after 36 h; during operation, common biliar duct was misidentified for subverted anatomy caused by inflammation. The common bile duct was clipped, and the patient presented jaundice after three days after operation. The colangiography was performed showing the stop. Therefore a reoperation was needed and laparotomic Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was performed. CASE 3: Dpt of Emergency Surgery, Second University of Naples 2000-2007, LC 520 (BTI 0,19%). Patient affected by more than 20 years symptomatic cholelithiasis, with only obesity risk factor; she underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and sudden bleeding of the cystic artery, poor vision and probably the long history of symptoms, producing a flogistic alteration of the anatomy, caused a misidentification of the cystic duct and the common bile duct with complete or lateral clipping of the common hepatic duct. The error was unrecognized intra-operatively but after progressive jaundice the postoperative colangiography showed a nearly complete stop by two clips. Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy with intraoperative cholangiographic control was performed."

We performed an analysis of a clinical series in order to study the clinical and biological spectrum of presentation, the preoperatory imagistic diagnosis and results of the surgical approach. Between 1986-2009, 30 patients with symptoms suggesting an insulinoma were hospitalized in our department. Preoperatory localization of insulinomas was possible in 16 patients. The most sensitive imagistic methods were ecoendoscopy and magnetic resonance. Intraoperatory ultrasound was performed in 16 patients and its sensitivity in detection of insulinomas was 93%; the combination between intraoperative ultrasound and manual exploration of pancreas by the surgeon reached a 100% sensitivity. Before the intraoperatory ultrasound was used the tumor excision was predominantly done by extensive pancreatic resection, while after this was available in our centre more conservative (enucleo-resection) procedures were chosen. In 1 patient the resection was done by laparoscopy, and in 1 patient by robotic surgery. The dimensions of the tumor were less than 2 cm in most of the patients; 2 had nesidioblastosis and 2 had multiple insulinomas; all 28 patients proved to have benign insulinomas at histological specimens.

CD009323,0,20184064,0,Small bowel malignant melanoma--report of three cases and review of literature.,"Malignant melanomas have a predilection to metastasize to the small bowel. Three patients with malignant melanoma involving the small bowel are reported. Two patients were operated on for small bowel obstruction and the third for gastrointestinal bleeding with anemia. Two patients remained well 6 month and 2 years, respectively, after surgery. One patient died of metastatic cerebral melanoma 6 months postoperatively. One should suspect small bowel metastasis in every patient with malignant melanoma in his past medical history, who presents with recent changes in bowel habits, intestinal obstruction or gastrointestinal bleeding. Preoperative assessment can only raise the suspicion, even with advanced imaging methods: capsule endoscopy, enteroscopy, CT or PET-CT. The only therapeutic procedure is surgical resection, offering both short term survival as well as an improvement in the quality of life. Although prognosis is dismal there are factors associated with prolonged survival: complete surgical resection with no residual primary or metastatic tumor, so-called primary small bowel tumors in patients aged more then 60 years, LDH < 200 U/L, lack of tumor spread in mesenteric lymph nodes."

CD009323,0,20177936,0,Video. Pure natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) cholecystectomy.,"Enthusiasm for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has been partly tempered by the reality that most NOTES procedures to date have been laparoscopically assisted. After safely performing transvaginal cholecystectomy in an IACUC-approved porcine model, the authors embarked on an institution review board (IRB)-approved protocol for ultimate performance of pure NOTES cholecystectomy in humans. They describe their experience performing a true NOTES transvaginal cholecystectomy after safely accomplishing three laparoscopically assisted or hybrid procedures in humans. One of the patients was a 35-year-old woman presenting with symptoms of biliary colic. Ultrasound confirmed gallstones, and her liver enzymes were normal. Pneumoperitoneum to 15 mmHg was obtained via a transvaginal trocar placed through a colpotomy made under direct vision. A double-channel endoscope then was advanced into the abdomen. To overcome the retracting limitations of currently available endoscopes, the authors used an extra-long 5-mm articulating retractor placed into the abdomen via a separate colpotomy made under direct vision using the flexible endoscope in a retroflexed position. Endoscopically placed clips were used for control of both the cystic duct and the artery. These techniques obviated the need for any transabdominally placed instruments or needles. This patient was the first to undergo a completely NOTES cholecystectomy at the authors' institution, and to their knowledge, in the United States. She was discharged on the day of surgery and at this writing has not experienced any complication after 1 month of follow-up evaluation. Performance of NOTES transvaginal cholecystectomy without aid of laparoscopic or needleoscopic instruments is feasible and safe for humans. Additional experience with this technique are required before studies comparing it with standard laparoscopy and hybrid techniques are appropriate."

CD009323,0,20158114,0,[Recent changes in perioperative nutritional support in patients undergoing thoracoscopic esophagectomy].,"The advent of thoracoscopic esophagectomy (TSE) has enabled early patient recovery in association with changes in perioperative nutritional support. This article reviews recent changes in the perioperative nutritional support for patients undergoing TSE. TSE associated with a laparoscopic procedure facilitates the recovery of gastrointestinal motility and function while decreasing the incidence of vocal cord paralysis and/or difficulties in swallowing due to accurate mediastinal lymph node dissection. Thus, recent trends in perioperative nutritional support have been early oral feeding and perioperative enteral feeding using a disease-specific polymeric immunoenhancing or immunomodulating enteral formula. Although TSE is associated with less surgical invasiveness, nutritional support still plays an important role in perioperative care to prevent postoperative complications and contribute to the early recovery of nutritional status. Moreover, since TSE is now performed to treat advanced esophageal cancer, patients are frequently malnourished preoperatively and therefore in the group at high risk for postoperative complications. The early start of oral feeding after the evaluation of swallowing function, selecting the appropriate route for enteral nutrition, and sufficient calorie intake during the perioperative period are essential to prevent postoperative pulmonary and/or infectious complications and consequently to improve patient quality of life."

CD009323,0,20148760,0,Clinical PET imaging of insulinoma and beta-cell hyperplasia.,"Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (PHH) is caused by solitary benign insulinoma or hyperplasia of pancreatic beta cells. In infants, PHH is caused by functionally defective hyperplastic beta cells, which are either diffusely or focally distributed in the pancreas. In adults, insulinoma is the most common cause of PHH, but recently, an increasing number of beta-cell hyperplasias has been reported among adults. The cause of adult beta-cell hyperplasia is not known. Whether the increased use of bariatric surgery in the treatment of severe obesity plays a role here is under investigation. Accurate localization of disease focus in both insulinoma and focal beta-cell hyperplasia provides an important support for surgery, especially as the use of laparoscopic surgery has increased. Conventional imaging of these challenging pancreatic lesions has evolved during recent years, but current imaging methods still lack sufficient sensitivity or are invasive. In most pancreatic NETs, the usefulness of positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) for lesion detection is limited because of the low glucose turnover of these tumors. Based on the capacity of pancreatic beta cells to take up and decarboxylate amine precursors, several investigators have studied patients with pancreatic NETs using aminoacid precursors, such as [(18)F]dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and [(11)C]hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), in an attempt to increase the sensitivity of PET scanning.

CD009323,0,20146582,0,"Insulinoma: pathophysiology, localization and management.","Insulinoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that causes oversecretion of insulin and, as a result, patients present with symptoms of hypoglycemia. Fortunately, insulinomas are usually benign and solitary, and surgical cure rates are highly favorable. Most of these tumors occur sporadically, but they can also be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type-1 syndrome. The diagnosis is confirmed by a supervised fast, and early detection is important. Several preoperative and intraoperative techniques with various success rates have been employed in order to localize the lesion. When technically feasible, tumor enucleation is the procedure of choice; however, a more formal resection may be necessary for certain tumors. In the age of laparoscopy, the role of laparoscopic surgery in the management of insulinomas is continuing to attract attention. This review will discuss the historical background, pathogenesis, diagnosis, localization and management of insulinomas."

CD009323,0,20076819,0,Staging laparoscopy in digestive cancers.,"BACKGROUND. Laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography may assist in the more accurate staging of digestive cancers. We assessed the diagnostic value of staging laparoscopy in patients with cancers of lower esophagus, stomach, liver, biliary tract, pancreas and colon. MATERIAL AND METHOD. Extended staging laparoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasonography and peritoneal cytology were performed in 165 patients with primary digestive cancers, admitted between January 2006 and December 2008 at three tertiary referral hospitals participating in the study. Staging laparoscopy was immediately followed by open surgery in 63 patients without distant metastases or with uncertain primary tumor resectability, and in 20 colorectal cancer patients with resectable hepatic metastases. The sensibility, sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of staging laparoscopy for distant metastases and tumor resectability were assessed against the findings on open surgery and the final pathological report. RESULTS. An unnecessary laparotomy was avoided in 36 of the 99 patients (36.4%) without distant metastases on imaging pre-therapeutic staging. The staging laparoscopy sensitivity for distant metastases varied between 66% and 100% and the diagnostic accuracy between 87% for the lower esophageal cancer and 100% for the biliary tract tumors. The overall morbidity of staging laparoscopy was 2.5% and the mortality 0. CONCLUSION. Staging laparoscopy avoids unnecessary laparotomies and changes the therapeutic plan in a significant number of patients. It can be performed just before the planned surgery or as a separate diagnostic procedure. The laparoscopy indications in digestive cancers are changing fast, with ongoing new developments in cancer treatment and laparoscopic technology."

CD009323,0,20046176,0,Experience in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is accepted as the procedure of choice for gallstone diseases but like all other procedure it is also not free from unwanted events. In this study, the authors have analyzed their experience in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and its complications and their management. Amongst the total 4957 laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) performed by the authors between April 1995 to May 2005 the male, female ratio was 1:5.6 (744 and 4213). 15.33%(760) of LC were carried out for the patients with acute cholecystitis. The age ranged from 9 years to 98 years. Mean operating time was 37 minutes (7 m to 187 m). Average hospital stay was 2.23 days (20 h to 7d). Peri-cholecystic adhesions including cholecysto-enteric fistulae and acute inflammation were the main reason for difficult dissection. This could be anticipated from the history of recurrent attack, high fever, severe pain and thick walled gall bladder (GB) on ultrasonography (USG). The main per-operative problem the authors came across was hemorrhage 5.2%(258), iatrogenic perforation of the gallbladder 15.12%(755) and common bile duct (CBD) injuries 0.12%(7). Conversion to open procedure was necessary in 0.68%(36) cases, most commonly due to obscure anatomy as a result of chronic inflammatory adhesions 0.56%(28), the other reasons for conversion were to deal with the CBD injury 0.04%(2), cholecysto-colic fistula 0.02%(1), unsuspected malignancy 0.06%(3) and uncontrolled bleeding 0.04%(2). The postoperative complications were port site infection and stitch granuloma 0.75%(37), bile leakage 0.08%(4), hemorrhage 0.06%(3), sub-hepatic abscess 0.02%(1), peritonitis due to gut perforation 0.04%(2) and retained bile duct stones 0.06%(3). Two deaths were due to septicemia resulting from gut perforation. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe procedure in the hands of a surgeon with adequate exposure to open surgery and properly oriented in minimally invasive surgery. Complications can be reduced to minimum if meticulous principle of dissection is followed. The unwanted events can mostly be managed laparoscopically without conversion. But decision for conversion should be taken early if there is any confusion and thus mortality and morbidity could be minimized."

Preoperative imaging findings suggested the presence of a tumor, which developed as an epidermoid cyst and originated from an intrapancreatic accessory spleen; however, the possibility of malignancy could not be ruled out. We therefore performed a laparoscopic-assisted distal pancreatectomy with a splenectomy for both diagnostic and treatment purposes. Five laparoscopic ports were created. After the spleen and pancreatic tail were dissected from the retroperitoneum laparoscopically, they were pulled out through a 7-cm left subcostal incision and resected with an endoscopic linear stapler. The operative time was 227 min and the blood loss was 400 ml. The postoperative course was uneventful. The final pathological diagnosis was in agreement with the preoperative diagnosis.

CD009323,0,19964407,0,Image-guided preparation of the Calot's triangle in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most common way to remove the gallbladder nowadays. Compared to open surgery, laparoscopy results in shorter hospital stays, reduced postoperative pain, and smaller incisions. Proper localization of the cystic artery is of great importance in laparoscopic cholecystectomy in order to ensure safe stapling and avoiding injury to the artery. In this study, we evaluate an image-guided method for artery detection. The performance of this method was evaluated in detecting arteries in 35 laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients. This method uses the artery's pulse to distinguish it from veins and biliary ducts. By subtracting the systolic and diastolic images, the change regions are detected and shown on a monitor. In 35 laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures the method can correctly detect all arteries that are not too deep and can move superficial tissues with zero false-negative and 12% false-positive rates. Using the second mode of the method that needs more time for processing, the false-positive rate decreased to 4% with zero false-negative. The image-guided technique is a sensitive, noninvasive, and cost-effective method to detect arteries in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, even if it is covered with fat or other tissues. It is possible to install the program on any ordinary laparoscopy set and it displays the artery's region on the monitor."

This study examined the evolving use and the performance of these two methods as primary technique for routine bile duct imaging, so as to detect common bile duct stones (CBDS) and to prevent common bile duct injury (CBDI). A prospective database permitted to evaluate the results of the two methods in 968 consecutive cholecystectomies. Nine hundered and twenty five were performed by laparoscopy, 18 (1.9%) by laparotomy and 25 (2.6) necessitated a conversion. The systematic use of the IOC was gradually replaced by a systematic use of the LUS. The success to delineate and evaluate the CBD, the detection of a CBDS, any type of bile duct complication, especially of CBDI, were registered. All the CBDS suspected by LUS were controlled by IOC. The patients were followed during 1 and 6 months. Six hundred and eighty five IOC and 269 LUS were performed. The procedure was technically unsuccessful in 35 IOC (5.1%) (mainly due to difficulty in catheterising the cystic duct) and in 2 LUS (1%) (due to steatosis). Concerning the detection of CBDS, 31 were detected by IOC (4.5%) and 16 by LUS (6%). Five IOC were considered as false positive, 1 as false negative (sensitivity and specificity of 96,9 and 99,2%) and 1 LUS as false positive (sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 99,6%). Five CBDI were detected in the complete seria: 2 during the dissection before the IOC, 1 thermic injury, 1 late stenosis, 1 lateral stenosis by the cystic clip detected by LUS.

It permitted to detect CBDS with a high specificity and sensitivity, and CBDS and was not followed by an increase in CBDI."
CD009323,0,19943563,0,[Left laparoscopic lobectomy].,"The authors present a case of a 61-year-old patient diagnosed with a hepatic tumor located in the second segment with expression on the anterior (diaphragmatic) side. The diagnosis and treatment applied in this case are presented. The specific feature was the surgical intervention because it was performed a left laparoscopic lobectomy using the LigaSure Atlas sealer. The short hospitalization period and quick recovery make this method an efficient one, with a wide application. Laparoscopic surgery started with a cholecystectomy which was performed by Mouret in 1987. Since then it knew a continuous development with progressive extension of this type of approach to almost all of the digestive tract organs, cavitary as well as parenchymal organs like liver or spleen. Second and third bisegmentectomy was made for the first time in 1996 by Azagra. The segments II, III, IVb, V and VI are the most frequently resected in hepatic laparoscopic surgery. Surgeons are more interested in left hepatic lobe diseases because of the anatomy which makes the approach of the biliary and blood vessels easier. Lately we assist to an increase of hepatic cancer incidence, primary or secondary; therefore we consider necessary the development of hepatic laparoscopic surgical techniques."
CD009323,0,19942828,0,Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy with the majority of patients dying within one year of diagnosis. While surgical resection with negative margins offers the only hope for cure only a small minority of patients are amenable to resection at the time of diagnosis owing to the propensity for early metastasis. While most advances in the last several decades have revolved around improvements in surgical techniques and postoperative outcomes, some modest inroads have been made with modern chemotherapy. This review discusses the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer and highlights some of the current issues. A Medline database search was performed to identify relevant articles using the keywords ""pancreatic adenocarcinoma"", ""diagnosis"", ""CA19-9"", ""pancreaticoduodenectomy"", ""adjuvant therapy"", ""chemotherapy"", and ""microRNA"". Additional papers were then identified by a manual search of the references from the key articles. While high quality CT is often the only imaging modality needed for preoperative evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cholangiography, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) have been utilized for diagnosis, staging, and/ or palliation. The controversies of pylorus preservation, extended lymphadenectomy, and laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy are discussed. Randomized controlled trials regarding the use of 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine are also reviewed. Early detection and aggressive surgical resection in combination with protocol-driven adjuvant therapy and novel molecular approaches are the only hope for cure. This review summarizes the recent literature on the abovementioned topics."

CD009323,0,19896600,0,A novel modification of traditional 2-port laparoscopic surgery using a 5-mm flexible scope.,"In embryonic natural orifice transumbilical endoscopic surgery, more than 1 port is inserted through the umbilicus. In the present study, embryonic natural orifice transumbilical endoscopic surgery combined with a flexible scope was used to further improve gynecologic surgery. A surgical incision was made in the umbilical region to enter the abdominal cavity using the closed approach. A 12-mm port was placed at the umbilical incision, and the 5-mm flexible scope was inserted through the port. Another surgical port was then made in the left inguinal region for insertion of a 5-mm port while monitoring it with the flexible scope. The flexible scope was then inserted through the 5-mm inguinal port, and another 5-mm port was inserted caudal to the 12-mm port while monitoring the umbilical region with the flexible scope. The 12- and 5-mm ports were inserted through the same umbilical incision so that they were positioned vertically. The surgeon stood on the left side of the patient to manipulate the 12-mm umbilical port with the right hand and the 5-mm inguinal port with the left hand. An assistant surgeon inserted the flexible scope through the 5-mm umbilical port and manipulated it with the left hand to secure the view during surgery by appropriately adjusting the angle of the flexible scope. With the present technique, the flexible scope did not interfere with the forceps inside or outside of the body cavity because its angle could be freely set. Since March 2, 2009, we have performed 8 procedures using this surgical technique including 1 salpingectomy, 3 ovarian cystectomies, 2 total laparoscopic hysterectomies, 1 linear salpingostomy, and 1 total laparoscopic myomectomy. Intracorporeal suturing was performed in all cases but one because a suture needle could be easily inserted through the 12-mm port. Furthermore, total laparoscopic myomectomy could be completed using a 12-mm power mocellator inserted through the 12-mm port. The flexible scope and forceps did not hinder each other either inside or outside of the body cavity. Use of the flexible scope enables the conventional rigid straight forceps to be used in almost the same manner as with the conventional laparoscopic technique."
CD009323,0,19894016,0,Surgical technique: new advancements for expanding indications and safety: the Western experience.,"The technical issues discussed herein represent part of the panorama of innovative approaches proposed for the surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); in particular, the attention is focused on the recent advances in the field of planning the surgical strategy and performing liver dissection via ultrasound guidance. It is described how recent technical advances have allowed the range of scenarios for which surgery is indicated in liver cirrhosis patients with HCC to be widened. Indeed, the ability to spare the liver parenchyma with respect to liver inflow and outflow and its biliary drainage as well as to perform the anatomic removal of subsegmental portions of the liver has enabled surgeons to provide new therapeutic horizons, and will probably result in modifications to the therapeutic flow charts of HCC patients once the new horizons are fully accepted by nonsurgical specialists devoted to the treatment of these complex patients."

CD009323,0,19886143,0,Increased incidence of pancreatic fistulas after the introduction of a bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement in distal pancreatic resections.,"Pancreatic fistula is a major cause of morbidity after distal pancreatic resection. When resections are performed with linear stapling devices, the use of bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement has been suggested to decrease the rate of pancreatic fistula. Our objective was to investigate the incidence of pancreatic fistula when using the Gore Seamguard staple line reinforcement in stapled distal pancreatic resections. A retrospective review of 30 consecutive patients with stapled distal pancreatectomy was conducted. A broad definition of pancreatic fistula was used. Clinicopathologic factors and outcomes were compared between groups. Pancreatic fistula was diagnosed in 11 of 15 patients (73%) and three of 15 patients (20%) in the Seamguard and non-Seamguard groups, respectively (P = 0.002). Pancreatic parenchymal transection at the neck of the gland was associated with pancreatic fistula, whereas laparoscopic procedures, splenic preservation, or additional organ resection were not. On multivariate analysis, the association between Seamguard use and pancreatic fistula was significant (P = 0.005). In conclusion, after introduction of the Gore Seamguard bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement, we experienced a significant increase in the rate of pancreatic fistula. This experience raises concern about the efficacy of this device in limiting pancreatic fistula after stapled distal pancreatic resection."

CD009323,0,19885707,0,Metabolic/bariatric surgery Worldwide 2008.,"Periodically, the state of bariatric surgery worldwide should be assessed; the most recent prior evaluation was in 2003. An email survey was sent to the leadership of the 36 International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders nations or national groupings, as well as Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Responses were tabulated; calculation of relative prevalence of specific procedures was done by weighted averages. Out of a potential 39, 36 nations or national groupings responded. In 2008, 344,221 bariatric surgery operations were performed by 4,680 bariatric surgeons; 220,000 of these operations were performed in USA/Canada by 1,625 surgeons. The most commonly performed procedures were laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (AGB; 42.3%), laparoscopic standard Roux-Y gastric bypass (RYGB; 39.7%), and total sleeve gastrectomies 4.5%. Over 90% of procedures were performed laparoscopically. Comparing the 5-year trend from 2003 to 2008, all categories of procedures, with the exception of biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch, increased in absolute numbers performed. However, the relative percent of all RYGBs decreased from 65.1% to 49.0%; whereas, AGB increased from 24.4% to 42.3%. Markedly, different trends were found for Europe and USA/Canada: in Europe, AGB decreased from 63.7% to 43.2% and RYGB increased from 11.1% to 39.0%; whereas, in USA/Canada, AGB increased from 9.0% to 44.0% and RYGB decreased from 85.0% to 51.0%. The absolute growth rate of bariatric surgery decreased over the past 5 years (135% increase), in comparison to the preceding 5 years (266% increase). Bariatric surgery continues to grow worldwide, but less so than in the past. The types of procedures are in flux; trends in Europe vs USA/Canada are diametrically opposed."
CD009323,0,19882099,0,Distal pancreatectomy with preservation of the spleen.,"Distal pancreatectomy (resection of the pancreatic body and tail) can be performed with or without preservation of the spleen. Splenic preservation has the advantages of fewer postoperative complications such as abscesses in the resection bed, shorter length of hospitalization, and avoidance of the long-term risk of post-splenectomy sepsis related to encapsulated bacteria. Two techniques can be used to save the spleen: either by dissecting out the splenic artery and vein with division of the arterial and venous branches between the pancreas and the splenic artery and vein; or by resecting the splenic artery and vein along with the pancreas but with careful preservation of the vascular collaterals in the splenic hilum, which allows the spleen to survive on the short gastric vessels (Warshaw technique). The latter method has been shown to be associated with a shorter operation, less blood loss, and a shorter hospitalization. In general the Warshaw technique is easier, especially for laparoscopic pancreatectomy. The subsequent appearance of enlarged gastric veins (varices) is to be expected as a consequence of loss of the splenic vein but has not led to bleeding from these natural collaterals during long-term follow up."

Laparoscopic subtotal cholecystectomy (LSC) is an option, which is still too infrequently used."
CD009323,0,19845186,0,Should all distal pancreatectomies be performed laparoscopically?,"Despite the relatively slow start of laparoscopic pancreatectomy relative to other laparoscopic resections, an increasing number of these procedures are being performed around the world. Operations that were once considered impossible to perform laparoscopically, such as pancreaticoduodenectomy and central pancreatectomy are gaining momentum. Technology continues to improve, as does surgical experience and prowess. There are both enough experience and data (though retrospective) to confirm that LDP with or without spleen preservation appears to be a safe treatment for benign or noninvasive lesions of the pancreas. Based on the fact that LDP can be performed with similar or shorter operative times, blood loss, complication rates, and length of hospital stay than ODP, it can be recommended as the treatment of choice for benign and noninvasive lesions in experienced hands when clinically indicated. It is very difficult to make clear recommendations with regard to laparoscopic resection of malignant pancreatic tumors due to the lack of conclusive data. As long as margins are negative and lymph node clearance is within accepted standards, LDP appears to have no untoward oncologic effects on outcome. Certainly more data, preferably in the manner of a randomized clinical trial, are needed before additional recommendations can be made. Potential benefits of laparoscopic resection for cancer include the ability to inspect the abdomen and abort the procedure with minimal damage if occult metastases are identified. This does not delay the onset of palliative chemotherapy, which would be the primary treatment in that circumstance. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that there is a greater likelihood of receiving systemic therapy if a laparotomy is avoided in patients who have radiologically occult metastases. Patients may also undergo palliative laparoscopic gastric and biliary bypass if indicated. Faster wound healing may also translate into a shorter waiting time before initiating adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. If the patient develops a wound infection, the infection should be more readily manageable with smaller incisions. Although not proven clinically relevant in humans, the reduction in perioperative stress associated with laparoscopic resection may translate to a cancer benefit for some patients. One report compared markers of systemic inflammatory response in 15 subjects undergoing left pancreatectomy. Eight had hand-access laparoscopic procedures and the rest had standard open surgery. The subjects in the laparoscopic group had statistically lower C-reactive protein levels than the open group on postoperative days one (5.5 mg/dL versus 9.7 mg/dL, P = .006) and three (8.5 mg/dL versus 17.7 mg/dL, P = .003), suggesting that the laparoscopic approach to left pancreatectomy is associated with less inflammation. While this report is underpowered, it supports the notion that MIS cancer surgery may induce less of a systemic insult to the body than standard open cancer surgery. More work in this area is necessary before any firm conclusions can be drawn. An important issue to consider is that of training surgeons to perform these complex procedures laparoscopically. Not all pancreatectomies are amenable to the laparoscopic approach, even in the most skilled hands. As such, only a percentage of cases will be performed this way and expectations to educate surgeons adequately to perform advanced laparoscopic procedures can be unrealistic, resulting in more ""on-the-job"" training. Another aspect that draws some controversy is that of the totally laparoscopic procedure versus the hand-access approach. No laparoscopic instrument provides the tactile feedback possible to obtain with the hand. The HALS approach allows for this, and the opportunity to control bleeding during the procedure. HALS also provides a way to improve confidence during the learning-curve phase of these operations. Finally, it is important to remember that if the procedure is failing to progress laparoscopically, or if cancer surgery principles are likely to be violated, the surgeon (and the patient) must be willing to abort the laparoscopic approach and complete the operation using standard open technique. During the next few years we can expect to see more robust outcome data with laparoscopic pancreatectomy. The expectation is that more data will come to light demonstrating benefits of laparoscopic pancreatic resection as compared with open technique for selected patients. Several groups are considering randomized trials to look at these endpoints. Although more retrospective and prospectively maintained data will certainly be presented, it is less likely that randomized data specifically examining the question oflaparoscopic versus open pancreatectomy for cancer will mature, due to some of the limitations discussed above. Additional areas of discovery are in staple line reinforcement for left pancreatectomy and suturing technology for pancreatico-intestinal anastomosis. Robotic surgery may have a role in pancreatic surgery. Improving optics and visualization with flexible endoscopes with provide novel surgical views potentially improving the safety of laparoscopy. Another area in laparoscopic surgery that is gaining momentum is that of Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES). NOTES represents the ""holy grail"" of incisionless surgery. Can we enucleate a small tumor off the pancreatic body by passing an endoscope through the gastric (or colonic) wall, and bring the specimen out via the mouth or anus? Can we use this approach for formal left pancreatectomies? Pioneers have already developed a porcine model of left pancreatectomy. This technology must clear several hurdles before it is cancer ready; however, technology is moving at a rapid pace."

Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery is an advanced laparoscopic procedure with a significant learning curve. It should be considered only by surgeons with extensive experience in open pancreatic surgery who possess advanced laparoscopic 'skills. Early reports suggest that laparoscopic pancreatic surgery can be accomplished with acceptable morbidity and mortality for the resection of small benign and low-grade malignant lesions in the body and tail of the pancreas and for the internal drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts. Its role in the management of lesions in the head, neck, and uncinate process of the pancreas is yet to be determined."

Delay in diagnosis of ZES is still a significant problem, and clinical suspicion should be elevated. The single best imaging modality for localization and staging of ZES is somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. Goals of surgical treatment for ZES differ between sporadic and MEN-1-related cases. All sporadic cases of ZES should be surgically explored (including duodenotomy) even with negative imaging results, because of the high likelihood of finding and removing a tumor for potential cure. Surgery for MEN-1-related cases should be focused on prevention of metastatic disease, with surgery being recommended when pancreatic tumors are greater than 2 cm. The role of Whipple procedure, especially for MEN-1 cases, should be explored further. Laparoscopic and endoscopic treatments are more experimental, but may have a role."

CD009323,0,19806301,0,Laparoscopic and robotic donor pancreatectomy for living donor pancreas and pancreas-kidney transplantation.,"Pancreas transplantation is a widely accepted procedure that can efficiently restore euglycemia and prevent progression of complications. In most instances, the limiting factor for deceased donor organ transplantation is the availability and quality of the available organs. Living donor pancreas transplant was introduced at the University of Minnesota in 1979. Because of the potential risks for the donor and the technical challenges in the recipient operation, this procedure has not become very popular since then. In 1999, in the attempt to decrease the morbidity associated with open distal pancreatectomy, the first laparoscopic donor distal pancreatectomy with hand-assisted technique was performed at the same institution. In 2000, the FDA approved the robotic surgical system Da Vinci for general use. Since then, the system has been extensively used at our institution to perform living donor nephrectomy. The only case reported worldwide of robotic distal pancreatectomy and nephrectomy for living donor pancreas-kidney transplantation was successfully performed by our team in 2006 at the University of Illinois at Chicago and proved as a promising technique. The application of minimally invasive techniques has allowed an increased acceptance of the procedure among potential donors and may, therefore, increase the number of donors for this life-saving transplant.

Sudden right upper quadrant tenderness appeared 2 days after admission. Ultrasonography revealed a large thick-walled cystic gallbladder and an inflammation-induced hyperechoic cystic duct. The long axis of the gallbladder was in a horizontal rather than a vertical alignment. Computed tomography demonstrated a markedly enlarged gallbladder with a slightly thickened wall and an enhanced twisted cystic pedicle. The diagnosis of gallbladder torsion led to laparoscopic detorsion and cholecystectomy. The gallbladder was gangrenous and was rotated counterclockwise with the attachment of the mesentery to the inferior surface of the liver.

He was discharged on the 8th hospital day, but 2 days later he was admitted to the hospital again because of vomiting and abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a narrow space between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and aorta as well as distension of the proximal duodenum. Upper gastrointestinal radiographic studies with gastrografin showed abrupt vertical cut-off sign of the third part of the duodenum. Therefore, we diagnosed SMA syndrome. We started conservative management by nasogastric tube and total parenteral nutrition through a central venous line. The patient was able to eat on day 24 and was discharged on day 34 after the treatment. SMA syndrome is considered as a postoperative complication after abdominal surgery, but it is extremely rare.

CD009323,0,19760934,0,Pelvic peritonization after laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection for low-rectal carcinoma treatment: surgical technique.,"Abdominoperineal resection is a standard method of low-rectum carcinoma treatment. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates, which decreased with the development of preoperative diagnostic procedures, new surgical techniques and new surgical instruments. In this article, laparoscopic pelvic peritonization was used after laparoscopic rectum amputation for low-rectum carcinoma treatment. Pelvic peritonization is performed after laparoscopic recto-sigmoid extirpation, using the extended absorbable intracorporeal suture with titanic clip application after every second suture. The role of titanic clip is to grasp the extended suture and to mark the postoperative irradiation field. Laparoscopic pelvic peritonization after laparoscopic abdominoperineal rectum amputation is a simple procedure with clinical importance in possible adhesion and postirradiatic enteritis prevention. This procedure can satisfy all oncological requirements and minimally invasive surgery principles and is acceptable for every patient in which rectum amputation is indicated."
CD009323,0,19757350,0,[Metastasis of an esophageal carcinoma at a PEG site--case report and review of the literature].,"We describe the case of a 54-year-old man with a tumour of the proximal esophagus (cT3-4,N1,M0), who underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for enteral feeding. Primary radiochemotherapy was initiated shortly after PEG insertion. Five months after PEG insertion the patient detected a nodule at the site. The general practitioner diagnosed this nodule as a brotic reaction. Another six weeks later, ulceration that had grown along the PEG probe at the PEG site was observed on gastroscopy. The primary tumour was not visible. Histological examination showed an abdominal wall metastasis of the esophageal cancer. Despite subtotal gastrectomy with en-bloc resection of the tumour, distant metastasis developed. The patient died six months after surgery. About 47 cases of abdominal wall metastases as late complications at the site have been reported until now. The mechanism of tumour spread of PEG site is a subject of controversial discussion. As direct mechanical tumour implantation is the most likely mechanism, an alternative method like operative (laparoscopic) or radiological PEG placement should be considered in cases with advanced, stenotic tumours."
CD009323,0,19755797,0,A case of giant mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas resected with laparoscopic surgery.,"We report a case of giant mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) of the pancreas that was successfully treated with laparoscopic surgery. A 29-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of an abdominal tumor that had been detected during a routine medical examination. The tumor was diagnosed as an MCN of the pancreas. We performed laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. The patient could begin oral feeding 3 days after the operation. No complications occurred either during or after surgery. The outcome in this patient was excellent, with cosmetically acceptable small scars in the skin. Therefore, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy may become a therapeutic option for patients with large MCNs of the pancreas."
CD009323,0,19752834,0,[Postoperative imaging of the peritoneum and abdominal wall].,"CT scan is the gold standard for follow-up after abdominal surgery and diagnosis of postoperative complications. During the immediate postoperative period, asymptomatic and rapidly regressing peritoneal collections of fluid and gas are often present. Transient ileus is classically present as well. The diagnosis of postoperative peritonitis is difficult on imaging; fluid collections are frequent and easily detected. The main postoperative peritoneal complication is small bowel obstruction, either early and due to inflammatory changes, or delayed and due to adhesions or less frequently to other causes, including transmesenteric hernia. Other rare complications include desmoid tumors and gossypiboma. Wall complications, after laparotomy as well as laparoscopic surgery, are mainly hematoma, infections and wound hernia."
CD009323,0,19752830,0,[Imaging of the postoperative biliary tract].,"For a long time, imaging of the biliary tract after surgical procedures was performed with invasive procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. Due to recent advances in diagnostic imaging, non-invasive techniques are now favored. While US remains the initial imaging modality, it is frequently followed by CT and/or MRCP. Image interpretation should always be performed in keeping with clinical and laboratory findings as well as the type of surgical procedure. The most appropriate imaging modality is selected based on these data. In patients with jaundice or biliary tract stenosis, MRCP, with use of an optimal technique and 3D acquisition, is the imaging modality of choice. In non-jaundiced patients with non-distended biliary tract and suspected bile leak, MRCP should be completed by the injection of a liver-specific contrast agent with biliary excretion to achieve non-invasive biliary tract opacification. In patients with malignancy, CT is preferred due to its high spatial resolution and ability to demonstrate small anastomotic tumor recurrences. CT should also be performed in patients with suspected hepatic artery or portal vein injury in addition to biliary tract injury or to detect distant complications."
CD009323,0,19750892,0,Treatment of duodenal duplication by trans-umbilical exploratory minimal laparotomy.,"Duodenal duplication cysts are rare congenital lesions usually diagnosed in infancy, although they may present in adulthood. Prenatal diagnosis is difficult, and postnatal diagnosis relies on ultrasonography, barium swallow, contrast-enhanced computerized tomography, magneticresonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. A female newborn was diagnosed with an abdominal cyst (size around 6 x 5 x 4 cm) at gestational age (GA) 24 weeks, by regular prenatal examination. After her birth at GA 37 weeks, we performed abdominal ultrasonography and RI, but there was no definite diagnosis. The usual management of an abdominal cyst involves resection by laparotomy (requiring a large incision) or laparoscopy (requiring several small incisions). We performed an exploratory trans-umbilical minimal laparotomy excision for surgery, and the pathology revealed duodenal duplication. In our case, there was no recurrence of the cyst after 18 months follow-up, and the operation scar was almost undetectable. Trans-umbilical minimal laparotomy excision may be considered as an alternative choice for the management of abdominal and duodenal duplication cysts."

CD009323,0,19725289,0,Laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy: a comparison of outcomes.,"Laparoscopic (lap) pancreatic surgery has been increasingly reported since its introduction in 1992. A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients undergoing elective lap and open distal pancreatectomy from 2002 to 2007 was performed. Univariate analysis was completed to evaluate perioperative variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to model predictors of postoperative pancreatic fistula. One hundred forty-eight subjects underwent distal pancreatectomy; 98 completed open, 44 lap, and six converted to open. There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative morbidity or mortality between the surgical approaches. Decreased operative time (156 vs 200 minutes, P < 0.01), blood loss (157 vs 719 mL, P < 0.01), and length of stay (5.9 vs 8.6 days, P < 0.01) were seen in the lap group. There was no significant difference in the rate of all pancreatic fistula formation (50 vs 46%, P = 0.94) or clinically significant leaks (18 vs 19%, P = 0.97) between techniques. A preoperative biopsy-proven cancer, increasing body mass index, history of pancreatitis, and male gender were significant predictors of having a pancreatic fistula. Lap and open distal pancreatectomy are performed safely at high-volume pancreatic surgery centers. This report provides ongoing support of the feasibility and safety of the lap approach with improved perioperative outcomes and equivalent pancreatic fistula rate."

A 45-year-old man was referred with hypoglycemia and diagnosed solitary insulinoma in the pancreas. Laparoscopic pancreatic enucleation was performed using an ultrasonic dissector. The tumor was extracted and the surgical margins were microscopically negative. Six years later, he presented with hypoglycemia again. Multiple small well-enhanced lesions were detected by computed tomography distant from the resection stump of the first operation. He underwent resection of all visible lesions with omentum and wide excision of the soft tissue surrounding the pancreas after preoperative arterial stimulation and venous sampling test. The postoperative course of the second operation was uncomplicated and the patient presents no sign of hypoglycemia after 12 months."

Here, we describe a severe cholecystitis patient who was treated successfully with percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder scopic lithotripsy by laser. The patient initially underwent percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage. Subsequent examination revealed a gallbladder stone impacted in the cystic duct. As the patient had a short and thick cystic ductal lumen, we decided to try to crush the stones through the fistula of the gallbladder drainage tube. We first dilated the fistula until it was approximately 12 Fr in size and then performed the percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder scopic lithotripsy procedure. Laser lithotripsy was performed twice to ensure clearance of all stones, including those in the common bile duct. The result was successful nonoperative treatment of a patient with Mirizzi syndrome involving a common bile duct stone, using laser lithotripsy via a cholangiofiber scope. This case suggests that laser lithotripsy is a feasible optional treatment method for severe cholecystitis patients having a percutaneous drainage tube."

CD009323,0,19597822,0,The role of arterial stimulation and simultaneous venous sampling in addition to cross-sectional imaging for localisation of biochemically proven insulinoma.,"Insulinomas, although rare, cause considerable morbidity but are frequently amenable to surgical cure. Laparoscopic surgery can now be considered if the tumour is localised pre-operatively, but the optimal imaging approach has not been determined. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of different imaging investigations, including CT, MRI, endoscopic ultrasound, octreotide scintigraphy and arterial stimulation with simultaneous venous sampling (ASVS), to localise insulinomas. All patients with biochemically proven insulinoma at our institution underwent ASVS along with other imaging investigations as part of their routine investigation. The results of these investigations were compared with histological findings. Twenty-eight patients with biochemically proven insulinoma confirmed by histology were identified. Ultimately ASVS localised a lesion in all patients. Seventeen patients (61%) had laparoscopic surgery. Tumor-detection rates for other imaging investigations included 43.5% of cases using CT, 71% using MRI, 86% using endoscopic ultrasound and 33% using octreotide scintigraphy. In four patients, the ASVS was the only test to correctly localise the lesion. ASVS should be considered routinely before surgery to ensure accurate localisation of insulinomas."

CD009323,0,19590637,0,Novel laparoscopic bipolar radiofrequency energy technology for expedited hepatic tumour ablation.,"Monopolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a well accepted modality for local control of hepatic tumours, but its effectiveness is challenged by prolonged ablation time, an inconsistent ablation zone and susceptibility to energy loss from convective heat loss from adjacent high-velocity blood flows ('heat sinks'). Bipolar RFA employs a dual parallel electrode array; the energy wave travels unidirectionally between and not around electrodes. This 'line-of-sight' delivery streams energy between two fixed points and concentrates energy delivery to the area between the probes. Bipolar RFA is postulated to yield reduced ablation time and to reduce or eliminate convective heat loss from adjacent high-velocity blood flows. The current study evaluated the feasibility, time and safety of this novel FDA-approved bipolar RFA technology using a laparoscopic approach in human liver tumours."
CD009323,0,19585074,0,Laparoscopic pancreatic resection: some benefits of evolving surgical techniques.,"Laparoscopic pancreatic resection began to be reported in the first half of the 1990s, with subsequent reports focusing primarily on the safety and usefulness of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (Lap-DP) for benign and low-malignancy lesions of the pancreatic body and tail (such as chronic pancreatitis, neuroendocrine tumor, mucinous cystic neoplasm, and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm). Recently we have also begun to see retrospective case-control studies comparing these techniques with open surgery, with Lap-DP showing advantages not only in terms of esthetics related to the surgical wound, but also with regard to reduced intraoperative bleeding, postoperative recovery time, and days of postoperative hospitalization. Prospective randomized controlled trials are still needed for confirmation, but it appears likely that this technique will become a standard surgical procedure for the treatment of diseases of the pancreatic body and tail. In contrast, laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (Lap-PD) remains controversial in the minds of many pancreatic surgeons. This is primarily due to the difficulty of laparoscopic reconstruction following resection. However, there have recently been a number of single-center reports on the use of this procedure in at least 20 patients per center, showing that Lap-PD is associated with considerable reduction in intraoperative bleeding. Our own experience has been similar. In carefully selected patients, we find Lap-PD to be a useful surgical procedure."

CD009323,0,19568608,0,Long-surviving patients with recurrent GIST after receiving cytoreductive surgery with imatinib therapy.,"In the treatment of recurrent or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), good prognoses may not be expected by surgery alone. Recently, imatinib has been applied for the treatment of GISTs, resulting in improved patient survival. However, long-term success is limited due to the development of resistance. Herein, we report two cases of long-surviving patients with recurrent GIST after receiving cytoreductive surgery with imatinib therapy. A 49 year-old man was diagnosed to a duodenal GIST with single hepatic metastasis, and an antrectomy including the duodenal lesion with intraoperative radiofrequency ablation were performed in April, 2002. After four months, a new metastatic hepatic lesion was identified. Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation was done, and imatinib therapy was started. A 56 year-old man underwent laparoscopic segmental resection of the distal ileum and partial excision of parietal peritoneum in March, 2001 to treat a malignant GIST of the distal ileum that was attached to parietal peritoneum. After six months, recurrence of GIST with peritoneal seeding and hepatic metastasis was found, and he underwent cytoreductive surgery including right hemicolectomy and wedge resection of liver. After surgery, there was no residual tumor grossly and imatinib therapy was started. In both cases, they were doing well with no evidence of recurrence for 5 years with imatinib therapy. Therefore, in patients with a recurrent GIST, improved survival can be expected with imatinib therapy after cytoreductive surgery."

CD009323,0,19562465,0,Left-sided approach for suprapancreatic lymph node dissection in laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy without duodenal transection.,"Laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with extended lymph node dissection has not yet been widely adopted for the treatment of gastric cancers because of the perceived complexity of the procedure. Suprapancreatic lymph node dissection is one of the most important and demanding procedures in this approach. The techniques of duodenal transection within the abdominal cavity or taping of the common hepatic or splenic artery had traditionally been adopted for suprapancreatic nodal dissection during open surgery. In 2005, we developed a new laparoscopic procedure to safely and simply perform suprapancreatic lymph node dissection in LADG. We introduced a left-sided approach for the dissection of lymph nodes in the left gastropancreatic fold, where the body of the stomach is turned over and lifted ventrally to expose the left gastropancreatic fold through the opened lesser sac, without duodenal transection, and the suprapancreatic lymph nodes are resected en bloc in reverse order, i.e., including the lymph nodes along the proximal splenic artery (station 11p), around the celiac artery (station 9), and along the common hepatic artery (station 8a). Between April 2005 and December 2007, a total of 391 patients with cT1,2 gastric cancer underwent this surgical approach. In all patients, surgery was completed safely with favorable outcomes; mean operating time was 239 min and mean blood loss was 63 ml. The complication rate was 4.6% (18/391); there were ten conversions (2.6%) and no mortality. The aim of the present study was to describe the surgical technique of our new approach for LADG with extended lymph node dissection and to evaluate the treatment outcomes achieved by this technique."

Distal pancreatectomy has significant postoperative morbidity and would permit rigorous examination in a controlled trial setting.
CD009323,0,19556903,0,Laparoscopy in the management of peritoneal carcinomatosis.,"The use of videolaparoscopy in the assessment of peritoneal carcinomatosis extent is now universally accepted. This procedure allows us to define with certainty the origin of the neoplasm, the peritoneal cancer index (PCI), the involvement of the small bowel and its mesentery, the feasibility of surgery and the index of attainable cytoreduction, the evaluation of an eventual multiorgan resection, and finally results in no mortality and very low morbidity.The indications for laparoscopy are as follows: staging of the carcinomatosis already diagnosed with imaging (CT scan and MRI), staging of carcinomatosis of dubious origin (biopsy), restaging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, restaging during follow-up in the case of dubious imaging, and restaging after adjuvant chemotherapy.Open (Hasson) technique has always been used in the introduction of the first trocar, and the changing position of the surgical bed allows for the evaluation of all the abdominal quadrants, limiting viscerolysis to the essential minimum to avoid iatrogenic lesions. Associating the intraoperative ultrasound has allowed us to reduce understaging of lesions at the depth of the diaphragm, of hepatic metastases and neoplastic masses at the pancreatic tail, and of the omental retrocavity.In all the cases in which diagnostic laparoscopy was followed by peritonectomy, we found a good correlation between open surgery data and the laparoscopic PCI. We excluded patients from peritonectomy if the staging laparoscopy showed a significant involvement of the small bowel or mesentery.We used videolaparoscopy to stage 197 cases of peritoneal carcinomatosis and achieved full laparoscopic PCI assessment in 196 of 197 (99.49%) cases, whereas only 4 of 197 (2.03%) cases were understaged before the routine use of laparoscopic ultrasound. Four complications were observed: 2 cases (1.02%) involved an infection of the trocar insertion site, which was treated with antibiotic therapy, and 2 cases (1.02%) involved diaphragm perforation and intraoperative bleeding, respectively, both resolved with videolaparoscopic technique. Two trocars were sufficient in 184 of 197 cases. There was no mortality and no port site metastasis.More recently, we have used videolaparoscopic surgery in the treatment of neoplastic ascites that did not respond to chemotherapy for palliative purposes, which resulted in the total disappearance of the ascites. It is now possible, in light of acquired experience, to evaluate with precision the indications, the technique, and the limits of the method both in the assessment of the carcinomatosis extent and in its palliation. In 28 cases of neoplastic ascites nonrespondent to chemotherapy, we were able to implement fully laparoscopic hyperthermic chemotherapy for the palliative treatment of the ascites, with total disappearance of it in all cases. The l-hyperthermic intraperineal chemotherapy was carried out at 42 degrees C for 90 minutes with 1.5% dextrose solution as a carrier. The chemotherapy solution was cisplatin and doxorubicin, or mitomycin, depending on the type of primary tumor. The drains were left in place and were removed when profuse drainage ceased.Ascites were controlled in all treated cases. A computed tomography scan performed in follow-up showed a small, clinically undetectable, fluid accumulation in the pelvis of 1 patient. Neither mortality nor morbidity was observed in connection with the procedure."
CD009323,0,19553047,0,[Hepatic surgery. What progress? What future?].,"Progress in liver surgery has increased the safety of all types of anatomical liver resections and has, in association with chemotherapy and interventional radiology, extended the limits of resectability for many primary and secondary liver tumors. This progress has been achieved thanks to a better method of vascular clamping, vascular reconstruction and better techniques and instruments to achieve more precise liver transection of this extremely vascular organ with a good haemostasis on the cut surface. These technical advances have allowed the procurement of partial liver grafts from living donors for transplantation and have also extended the scope of laparoscopic access to practically all types of hepatic resections. Preoperative manipulation of the liver volume with hypertrophy of the future liver remnant has made complex and extended hepatectomies feasible. These major hepatic resections are often performed in the background of damaged liver parenchyma due to chronic liver disease, steatosis and chemotherapy-induced lesions. A better knowledge of the functional anatomy with a clearer understanding of the role of venous drainage in the recovery of liver function and the process of regeneration have been the major factors which have facilitated these extended resections. The future of hepatic surgery, which is constantly influenced by the continuous technical progress with computer-aided reconstruction of the tumor zones and vascular and biliary anatomy, is certainly going to see a robotic-assisted surgical approach. Indications will change. While major and complex resections will still be required for advanced tumors, very few benign lesions will be operated in the future. Huge changes will happen in the management of malignant lesions where surgery will become a part of a combined therapeutic strategy where oncologic and radiointerventional treatments will have a major role. Surgery could then be limited to the resection of residual nodules susceptible to harbour persistent viable tumor cells."

The method is effective in the treatment of malign lesions of the III and IV duodenum and during laparoscopic subtotal colectomy with anastomosis between the ascending colon and the rectum. Ultimately, the procedure allows for the verticalization of the duodenal C and the anterior positioning of the mesenteric vessels, facilitating biopsy and resection of the III and IV duodenal portions and allowing anastomosis of the ascending rectum, avoiding both subtotal colectomy and the risk of torsion of the right colic loop. Although the procedure calls for extensive experience with advanced video-laparoscopic surgery, it is both feasible and repeatable. In our experience we have observed no mortality or morbidity."

It took many years to get to this stage for various obstacles had to be overcome. In the end, it was the low intra- and postoperative complication rates together with the rapid reconvalescence of the patients and their wish to be quickly discharged from hospital which led to an unstoppable diffusion of the method. With the increased use of the procedure and the expertise of the surgeons, it entered the field of gynaecological oncology and met similar reservations. Once again the same convincing advantages helped overcome the resistance. Thus, laparoscopic surgical procedures have secured a place in the treatment of corpus and cervical carcinomas, as their surgical safety has been proved. The aim of future examinations should be the proof of non-inferiority compared to the open techniques because the advantages of the laparoscopic procedure have been sufficiently proved.

Because carcinoid tumors of the gastrointestinal tract tend to spread to the submucosal layer even during the early stages of the disease, the possibility of tumor seeding in the vertical margin of the tumor cannot be eliminated by conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). In addition, because the duodenal wall is thinner than the gastric wall, EMR performed for duodenal lesions may be associated with a high risk of accidental perforation. In this article, we introduce a minimally invasive endoscopic full-thickness resection technique after laparoscopic repair for the local resection of duodenal carcinoid tumors."
CD009323,0,19506584,0,Surgical management of pancreatic endocrine tumors.,"Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) are uncommon but clinically challenging and fascinating tumors with an annual incidence of 1 per 100,000 people. PETs present as either functional pancreatic tumors or as nonfunctional pancreatic tumors. Functional tumors are commonly associated with a specific hormonal syndrome directly related to a hormone secreted by the tumor, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or organic hyperinsulinism. Nonfunctional tumors do not secrete a hormone resulting in a pathologic syndrome of clinical symptoms. The natural history of PETs is highly variable. Small, benign neoplasms, such as 90% of all insulinomas, are readily curable by surgical resection; however, most other functional and all nonfunctional pancreatic tumors have a much less favorable prognosis. Patients with completely resected tumors generally have a good prognosis, and an aggressive surgical approach in patients with advanced disease may also prolong survival. Many features of the management of pancreatic endocrine tumors, such as timing and extent of resection, and the use of laparoscopic procedures, are currently under debate. This Review describes the current status of surgical treatment for pancreatic endocrine tumors, and discusses the new developments in this field."

CD009323,0,19495882,0,Evolving treatment strategies for gallbladder cancer.,"Gallbladder cancer is an uncommon cancer that has traditionally been associated with a poor prognosis. In the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, incidental gallbladder cancer has dramatically increased and now constitutes the major way patients present with gallbladder cancer. While patients with incidental gallbladder cancer have a better survival than patients with nonincidental gallbladder cancer, incidental gallbladder cancer can be associated with a varied prognosis. Imaging with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and [18]F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), as well as diagnostic laparoscopy, all have varying roles in the workup of patients with incidental gallbladder cancer. For patients with T1b, T2, and T3 incidental gallbladder cancer re-resection is generally recommended. At re-exploration, many patients with incidental gallbladder cancer will have residual disease. Definitive oncologic management requires re-resection of the liver, portal lymphadenectomy, and attention to the common bile duct. The extent of the hepatic resection should be dictated by the ability to achieve a microscopically negative (R0) margin. Routine resection of the common bile duct is unnecessary but should be undertaken in the setting of a positive cystic duct margin. If an incidental gallbladder cancer is discovered at the time of surgery, whether the surgeon should directly proceed with a more definitive oncologic operation should depend on the surgeon's skill-set and experience. Gallbladder cancer has a propensity to recur. Although data for adjuvant therapy following resection are limited, some data do suggest a survival benefit for adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. Management of patients with gallbladder cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach with input from a surgeon skilled in hepatobiliary surgery."

CD009323,0,19443996,0,Liver cyst with biliary communication successfully treated with laparoscopic deroofing: a case report.,"A 56-year-old woman visited our hospital because of high fever and right hypochondralgia. Abdominal computed tomography showed a liver cyst 10 cm in diameter and dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct. Percutaneous transhepatic drainage of the cyst guided by ultrasonography disclosed that the cyst contained a brown milky fluid, and cystography showed biliary communication. Thus, the cyst was diagnosed as an infectious hepatic cyst with biliary communication. Treatments for liver cysts include aspiration therapy, alcoholic sclerotherapy, laparoscopic fenestration, fenestration by laparotomy, cystojejunostomy, cystectomy, and hepatectomy. Because a simple liver cyst is benign, treatments should be low-risk and minimally invasive; thus, we performed laparoscopic fenestration. Fenestration should not be performed if the case is complicated by infection or biliary communication. Although cystography showed biliary communication, the cyst was not visualized with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, and we concluded that the biliary communication was small. Operation time was 95 minutes, and blood loss was 10 g. Pathological findings of the liver cyst were consistent with a simple cyst. The postoperative course was good, and the patient left the hospital 10 days after the operation. Eighteen months have passed since the operation, and no recurrent cysts have been detected with computed tomography. This is the second report of liver cyst with biliary communication successfully treated with laparoscopic deroofing. Laparoscopic fenestration is a useful method for treating simple benign liver cysts because of its minimal invasiveness and may be useful in cases with small biliary communication."

In this article, we report 2 cases of successful laparoscopic near-total pancreatectomy for PHH. Two infants underwent surgery at the age of 60 and 54 days and at body weights of 7700 and 5700 g, respectively. Four ports were used for the patient 1 and three ports plus fixation sutures of the stomach to the abdominal wall for stomach traction were used for patient 2. The pancreas was dissected free from the spleen and splenic vessels and was mobilized beyond the right side of the superior mesenteric vein. The head of the pancreas was transected by using the Harmonic Scalpel (Tokyo, Japan), leaving only 1 cm of the pancreas along the duodenal C-loop. The operative times were 180 and 160 minutes. There was neither an intra- nor a postoperative abdominal complication. Oral feeding was resumed on the postoperative day 1. The blood glucose level increased immediately after the operation.

CD009323,0,19392847,0,Systematic approach of postoperative gastric conduit complications after esophageal resection.,"Complications after esophagectomy related to ischemia of the graft are dreaded. Prompt assessment of the situation is essential. The series presented describes our experience regarding the evaluation of gastric tube complications. A score is presented classifying flexible endoscopy and CT-scan findings. A retrospective analysis from the charts of 47 consecutive patients who underwent esophagectomy for cancer was conducted. Patients who underwent upper endoscopy during admittance were entered in this study. Findings on flexible endoscopy and CT scan were systematic scored. According to the findings, different attitudes were taken. Between January 2006 and December 2007, 47 patients underwent esophagectomy for cancer. Eleven (23%) out of 47 patients were suspected to have complications related to the viability of the anastomosis. Median period to deterioration was 5 days. In 3 (27%) patients, stent placement was the only intervention necessary. In 2 (18%) patients, stent placement was combined with drainage of abscesses in the upper mediastinum. Five (46%) patients required a new right thoracotomy, with drainage of mediastinal abscesses and empyema. In 2 patients a limited resection and a new cervical anastomosis with a stent was created. Mean intensive care admission and hospital admittance was 30.2 days and 67.9 days, respectively. Two patients (18%) died during hospital admittance. All cervical anastomosis required postoperative dilatation. No complications related to the use of flexible endoscopy were seen. An aggressive policy is adopted in patients deteriorating following esophagectomy. CT-scanning of the thorax and a flexible endoscopy of the gastric conduit should always be performed. Direct therapy should be adopted without delay."
CD009323,0,19391338,0,[Role of laparoscopy in acute obstruction of the small bowel: personal experience and analysis of the literature].,"Small bowel obstruction is caused by postoperative adhesions in most patients. The traditional surgical treatment has been laparotomy with adhesiolysis and possible resection of the ischaemic intestine. The laparoscopic approach has proved feasible but not without risks. We analysed our experience in the management of acute small bowel obstruction and then reviewed the literature in an attempt to identify the real role of laparoscopy. From January 2003 to June 2008, 19 patients operated on for small bowel obstruction were identified. We evaluated our performance in terms of the aetiology of the obstruction, operative time, length of postoperative hospital stay, conversion rate, and major morbidity and mortality. Postoperative adhesions were responsible for the occlusion in 13 cases; a single band was identified in 47% of patients (9 cases). Neoplastic disease (3 cases), a gallstone ileus, Crohn's disease and an internal hernia were the remaining cases. Laparoscopic treatment was only possible in 7 patients with single adhesions (77%), and a conversion was carried out in the remaining 12 cases (63%), including ""laparoscopy-assisted"" cases (6 cases). The duration of the intervention (89 +/- 21 min vs 135 +/- 27.5 min) and postoperative hospitalisation (3.6 +/- 1 days vs 6.25 +/- 1.6 days) were in favour of the completely laparoscopic group as compared to the laparoscopy-assisted group. A case of postoperative peritonitis due to bowel perforation required a second intervention. With an appropriate selection of patients, confirming the high incidence of the single adhesions responsible for the occlusion and the resulting high success rate of laparoscopy, we believe that only an initial laparoscopic approach can help identify such favourable situations."

This is a report on a patient with multiple endocrine abnormalities, who did not fulfill the criteria of known syndromes (MEN) and the clinical-anesthetic particularities that influenced the anesthetic management. CASE REPORT A 23-year old female patient with episodes of hypoglycemia difficult to control, associated with Cushing's disease and prolactinoma without symptoms of pituitary compression and with normal thyroid and parathyroid. Investigation found a retroperitoneal mass of unknown origin which in face of the clinical presentation raised the hypothesis of insulinoma. The patient also referred to be a Jehovah's Witness. Biopsy of the mass by video-laparoscopy and enucleation of the insulinoma were proposed. On physical exam the patient was overweight, had protruding teeth, she was classified as Mallampati 3 and had symptoms of sleep apnea. Laboratorial exams revealed hematocrit 58%. Pre-anesthetic medication consisted of oral midazolam (7.5 mg) and clonidine (200 microg). Fentanyl (150 microg), clonidine (90 microg), propofol (150 mg) and pancuronium (8 mg) were used for anesthetic induction and she was intubated without intercurrences. Central venous access and invasive blood monitoring were instituted. Intravenous infusion of D5W with electrolytes was instituted and capillary glucose levels were monitored every 30 minutes, which did not demonstrate any episodes of hypoglycemia during the surgery. The patient remained hemodynamically stable even during the pneumoperitoneum. She developed postoperative episodes of hypoglycemia, which motivated the re-operation."

CD009323,0,19347662,0,NOTES and endoscopic pancreatic necrosectomy for the GI endoscopist.,"Endoscopists seek to conduct more aggressive surgical procedures that surpass the limitations of existing endoscopic procedures. Endoscopic pancreatic necrosectomy and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) are typical examples of this new trend; both are performed through the gastrointestinal wall without a skin incision. Endoscopic necrosectomy is effective for managing organized pancreatic necrosis and abscesses. The necrotic tissues are removed endoscopically by directly entering the cavity of the organized pancreatic necrosis. NOTES is a possible advance over surgical intervention, as it is a less invasive, more cosmetic, and effective procedure. There are various approaches, including the esophagus, stomach, colon, and vagina; Various procedures are possible using NOTES, such as cholecystectomy, appendectomy, full-thickness stomach resection, splenectomy, gastrointestinal (GI) anastomosis, and peritoneoscopy. The requirements for NOTES include high proficiency in endoscopic techniques, including knowledge of various devices, anatomy, and surgical procedures. Since most GI endoscopists have no surgical background, to increase the usage of NOTES, GI endoscopists should form and lead teams that include various specialists. We believe that endoscopic necrosectomy and NOTES represent a major shift in the treatment paradigm because physicians can treat beyond the gastrointestinal wall and endoscopic procedures will replace surgical treatment."

This paper describes a totally laparoscopic pylorus-preserving PD performed for an intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm. After the laparoscopic resection, an end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy including duct-to-mucosa anastomosis without a stenting tube, an approximation of the pancreas stump and jejunal wall, an end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy, and an end-to-side duodenojejunostomy were performed intracorporeally. The patient recovered without any complications and was discharged on the 14th postoperative day. The surgical margin was free of neoplastic changes. Although the experience is limited and the appropriate indications must await future studies, this case indicates that a laparoscopic pylorus-preserving PD can be feasible, safe, and effective in highly selected patients."
CD009323,0,19319644,0,Perineal hernia as a rare complication after laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection: report of a case.,"We report what seems to be the second documented case of perineal hernia after laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection (APR) and describe its successful repair with transperineal intraperitoneal mesh. An 89-year-old woman complained of a large, painful perineal swelling 4 months after APR for rectal cancer. Computed tomography (CT) showed small intestine protruding through the pelvic floor into the perineal area. However, opening of the hernia sac revealed no intra-abdominal adhesions. An oval, 8 x 12 cm Bard Composix Kugel Patch (Davol, Cranston, RI, USA) was inserted into the intraperitoneal space and secured over the defect in the pelvic floor; then firmly attached to the pelvic wall with 16 interrupted nonabsorbable sutures. There has been no sign of hernia recurrence in 10 months of follow-up. We speculate that because laparoscopic surgery is minimally invasive, fewer postoperative adhesions in the abdominal cavity can result in the small bowel sliding more readily into the perineal area. Based on our experience, perineal hernia after laparoscopic APR can be repaired easily and effectively with a Composix Kugel Patch."
CD009323,0,19317933,0,Congenital choledochal malformation: not just a problem for children.,"Choledochal cysts remain relatively uncommon in Western Europe and the US, although they are appreciably more common in Asia. Their aetiology remains obscure although abnormalities of the pancreaticobiliary junction may be the primary pathology in some, with biliary dilatation following reflux of activated pancreatic secretions. Most anomalies will present in childhood with obstructive jaundice or abdominal pain; a proportion may only present for the first time during adulthood, and some of these will show malignant transformation. The classical triad of pain, jaundice and a palpable mass is, however, not common. Complete cyst excision, where possible, and biliary reconstruction remain the aims for most types although there is still some controversy about the type of reconstruction. Laparoscopic reconstruction is possible but is still very much an advanced technique. The risk of long-term problems post-surgery is significant. Whether this is due to recurrent pancreatitis secondary to the retained common channel and/or a distal stump, or due to the development of biliary tract malignancy is still a cause for concern and indicates the need for adequate, prolonged follow-up."

It seems evident that a close cooperation between surgeon and endoscopist will be needed on a routine basis. A laparoscopic-assisted transgastric ERCP is a well-documented approach to investigate the pancreatico-biliary tree in patients where the duodenum has been bypassed as in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. In this case we present the possibility of assisting the endoscopist not only by providing access to the gastric remnant but also by helping with laparoscopic instruments during duodenoscopy. A formally obese woman who had benefited from a RYGB developed recurrent jaundice despite a precedent common bile duct exploration and choledocho-duodenostomy. A laparoscopic-assisted transgastric endoscopy revealed an obstructed choledocho-duodenostomy caused by accretions around a migrated clip.

With the aid of radiologically guided drainage catheters, necrosectomy for acute pancreatitis can be delayed and accomplished laparoscopically in a select patient population. Pancreatic pseudocysts from chronic pancreatitis can now be approached via minimally invasive strategies, including emerging combined laparoscopic procedures and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. It is clear that laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy is possible in experienced hands; pancreatic neoplasms in the body and tail are more suitable for laparoscopic procedures because distal pancreatic resection requires no reconstruction of the biliary or enteric tract. Laparoscopic staging of pancreatic tumors has decreased as preoperative radiographic imaging becomes more sensitive. Similarly, laparoscopic palliative procedures have decreased because of the emergence of other minimally invasive options for relieving gastric outlet obstruction and biliary obstruction. Nonetheless, major advances in minimally invasive pancreatic surgery will continue as technology and skill sets advance."

Massive hemobilia is a rare but potentially life-threatening cause of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Arterio-biliary fistula is an uncommon cause of hemobilia. We describe a case of cystic artery pseudo-aneurysm causing arterio-biliary fistula and presenting as severe melaena and cholangitis that occurred 7 months after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Gastroduodenoscopy failed to establish the exact source of bleeding and hepatic artery angiography and selective embolization of the pseudo-aneurysm successfully controlled the bleeding. Pseudo-aneurysm of the hepatic artery is mostly iatrogenic due to biliary intervention, as demonstrated in this case.

Laparoscopic treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts enables definitive drainage with faster recovery. Pseudocysts located adjacent to the posterior gastric wall are best drained by pseudocyst gastrostomy. Although the anterior approach for drainage has frequently been reported, reports on the posterior approach are rare."
CD009323,0,19260625,0,[The role of minimally invasive surgery in the diagnosis and treatment of tumors in children].,"The paper aims to define the actual place and benefits of the minimal invasive techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of tumors in children. There are reviewed the indications, limits and complications of this method in digestive tract, liver, pancreatic, adnexal, testicular and renal tumors, in lymphomas, as well as in tumors with intra-thoracic location. The benefits of the minimal access approach, such as the decrease of the parietal complications as well as the negative impact of the surgical act upon the body have a particular significance in pediatric cancer patients. Their quicker recovery allows an early subsequent initiation of the chemo- or/and radiotherapy. Within the complex treatment of tumors in children, the minimal invasive surgery has a diagnostic value through inspection and directed biopsy. The laparoscopic inspection decreases the number of non-therapeutic laparotomies in non-operable patients with tumors that were not preoperatively diagnosed using imaging methods. The laparoscopic resection of the tumors within oncological limits is possible in the localized types (stage I). As a particular aspect of the laparoscopic approach in children, it is worth mentioning the difficulties related to the necessity of using adequate-size instruments and to the less favorable relation between the size of the tumor and the diminished working space."

CD009323,0,19259610,0,The critical view of safety in laparoscopic cholecystectomy is optimized by exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer.,"During laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), misidentification of the cystic duct, which causes major bile duct injuries, can result from wrong or incomplete dissection of Calot's triangle. Therefore, the critical view of safety has been accepted as a safe method for gaining a sufficient view of Calot's triangle before transecting the cystic duct. However, even in cases without aberrant anatomy of the bile duct, bile duct injury can occur by a wrong approach to a critical view of safety. Additionally, in cases of badly inflamed gallbladders, it is often hard to achieve a critical view of safety, because Calot's triangle is often solid and cannot be expanded. In our standardized procedure, which is based on exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer (the ss-i layer), the critical view of safety can be safely achieved. We have safely performed LC, using our standardized procedure, for many cases with cholecystitis with highly inflamed gallbladders. In this article, focusing especially on prevention of bile duct injuries, we present our standardized procedure to achieve the critical view of safety along with histological findings."

CD009323,0,19252471,0,Laparoscopic left liver sectoriectomy of Caroli's disease limited to segment II and III.,"Caroli's disease is defined as a abnormal dilatation of the intra-hepatica bile ducts: Its incidence is extremely low (1 in 1,000,000 population) and in most of the cases the whole liver is interested and liver transplantation is the treatment of choice. In case of dilatation limited to the left or right lobe, liver resection can be performed. For many year the standard approach for liver resection has been a formal laparotomy by means of a large incision of abdomen that is characterized by significant post-operatie morbidity. More recently, minimally invasive, laparoscopic approach has been proposed as possible surgical technique for liver resection both for benign and malignant diseases. The main benefits of the minimally invasive approach is represented by a significant reduction of the surgical trauma that allows a faster recovery a less post-operative complications. This video shows a case of Caroli s disease occured in a 58 years old male admitted at the gastroenterology department for sudden onset of abdominal pain associated with fever (> 38 C degrees), nausea and shivering. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a significant dilatation of intra-hepatic left sited bile ducts with no evidences of gallbladder or common bile duct stones. Such findings were confirmed abdominal high resolution computer tomography. Laparoscopic left sectoriectomy was planned. Five trocars and 30 degrees optic was used, exploration of the abdominal cavity showed no adhesions or evidences of other diseases. In order to control blood inflow to the liver, vascular clamp was placed on the hepatic pedicle (Pringle s manouvre), Parenchymal division is carried out with a combined use of 5 mm bipolar forceps and 5 mm ultrasonic dissector. A severely dilated left hepatic duct was isolated and divided using a 45 mm endoscopic vascular stapler. Liver dissection was continued up to isolation of the main left portal branch that was then divided with a further cartridge of 45 mm vascular stapler. At his point the left liver remains attached only by the left hepatic vein: division of the triangular ligament was performed using monopolar hook and the hepatic vein isolated and the divided using vascular stapler. Haemostatis was refined by application of argon beam coagulation and no bleeding was revealed even after removal of the vascular clamp (total Pringle s time 27 minutes). Postoperative course was uneventful, minimal elevation of the liver function tests was recorded in post-operative day 1 but returned to normal at discharged on post-operative day 3."
CD009323,0,19249742,0,A novel laparoscopic approach to lesions related to the posterior aspect of the pancreatic head.,"The posterior aspect of the pancreatic head has proven to be a technically demanding region to approach laparoscopically. Previously, this region was approached through the gastrocolic ligament with the patient in a left semilateral position. We believe that this makes the laparoscopic approach to the posterior pancreatic head extremely difficult. In the technique presented here, which has been successfully used in 4 patients, the patient was in full left lateral position, and Nathanson retractors were used to retract the liver and right kidney. This allowed full exposure of the second part of the duodenum before any major dissection. The duodenum was then Kocherized, and the posterior aspect of the pancreatic head, along with the inferior vena cava, left renal vein, and aorta, was exposed. We describe here a safe and feasible laparoscopic method for access to and management of lesions related to the posterior aspect of the pancreatic head."
CD009323,0,19249715,0,Postoperative small bowel obstruction associated with use of hemostatic agents.,A case of early postoperative small bowel obstruction (SBO) after intraoperative use of hemostatic agents during laparoscopic staging for endometrial cancer is reported. A 46-year-old woman underwent a laparoscopic staging procedure for endometrial cancer during which hemostatic agents were used in the management of an iatrogenic injury to the inferior vena cava. The patient returned on postoperative day 6 with SBO and was taken to the operating department. She required a small bowel resection in the specific area where the hemostatic agents were used. Pathology showed extensive fibrotic changes caused by a foreign material that was suggestive of a thrombin-related product. Use of hemostatic agents should be considered as a cause in the differential diagnosis of patients with early postoperative SBO.
CD009323,0,19246188,0,Regional nodal staging for early stage colon cancer in the era of endoscopic resection and N.O.T.E.S.,"Advanced endoscopic technologies and techniques capable of providing localized resection of colonic primaries are entering clinical practice. As much as Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (N.O.T.E.S.) may ultimately provide for transmural resection with narrow margins, intraluminal techniques such as endoscopic submucosal resection can now effect excision of early stage tumors from within the colon. However, the limit on the application of these approaches is oncological providence as current staging requires en bloc mesenteric resection in every case to ensure that adequate nodal assessment is assured. Furthermore, this requirement is also a limiting factor on the advance of innovative procedures such as Single-Incision Laparoscopic Surgery and N.O.T.E.S.-hybrid techniques as these approaches, while likely adept at the definitive management of the primary, have limitations regarding their ability to provide full base mesenteric resection (due mostly to constraints on retraction capacity as well as operating field space and exposure). Therefore a means to accurately and efficiently identify those patients who are truly node negative (and so in whom radical mesenteric lymphadenectomy could be avoided) would allow all of these techniques to advance with a clear focus on address of the primary. This review analyses the current state of the art of regional staging in the colonic mesentery in place of formal lymphadenectomy. It includes deliberation of both preoperative non-invasive testing as well as novel means of employing N.O.T.E.S. approaches to allow direct determination of lymph node status (in particular that of sentinel nodes) by either rapid histopathological examination or by emerging technologies such as Optical Coherence Tomography that may provide optical or 'virtual' biopsy."

No malignancy was observed in the resected gall-bladder and the patient exhibited a good postoperative course. Eleven months postoperatively he presented with two subcutaneous tumours: one at the port-site on the right anterior axillary line (at the position of the vacuum drain) and the other at the subumbilical port-site. The patient underwent an incisional biopsy, which revealed metastatic adenocarcinomas of the primary extrahepatic duct, with no evidence of a primary tumour or other distant metastasis. The patient underwent wide excision of the subcutaneous tumours. Six months later he again presented with subcutaneous tumours at the same positions. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen revealed only the subcutaneous tumours. The patient again underwent wide excision of the subcutaneous tumours, followed by radiotherapy. At a 21-month follow-up the patient was symptom-free. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography results were normal, and there was no evidence of other metastasis. Four months later the patient died from metastatic disease of the abdomen."

CD009323,0,19238051,0,Laparoscopic resection of a retroperitoneal schwannoma adherent to vital vessels.,"Despite the wide acceptance of laparoscopic resection of abdominal tumors, few cases of laparoscopic removal of retroperitoneal schwannoma have been reported to date. We present a case of retroperitoneal schwannoma, encircled with the celiac artery, common hepatic artery, splenic artery, splenic vein, and portal vein, which was resected successfully using laparoscopic surgical technique. During the procedure, an attempt was made to approach the neoplasm via the inferior border of the pancreas, but it was hard to separate the superior mesenteric vein. We changed the position to separate the tumor from the anterior border of the splenic vein with success. Without any complications, the patient was discharged on the sixth postoperative day. In contrast to the open procedure for resection of a tumor in this location, laparoscopy has the advantage of precise visualization, which helps to resect retroperitoneal schwannoma completely."

CD009323,0,19231557,0,Early management of traumatic pancreatic transection by spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.,Pancreatic trauma is a common cause of acute pancreatitis in children and is often treated by conservative measures alone. Conservative measures are more likely to fail when there is complete pancreatic duct disruption. We report a case of complete transaction of the pancreatic neck following blunt trauma in a 14-year-old boy. Complete duct disruption was confirmed by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography. The patient was successfully managed by a laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy and recovered quickly without complications. The merit of a laparoscopic approach to severe pancreatic injury in children is discussed.

CD009323,0,19214364,0,Anatomical assessment of bile ducts of Luschka in human fetuses.,"Bile ducts of Luschka (also called subvesical or supravesicular ducts) can cause bile leakage during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, especially if surgery is carried out in ignorance of such variations. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical anatomy of these ducts in human fetuses and frequency of the ducts locating near gallbladder fossa. Thirty-two fetal cadaver livers were dissected and the gallbladders were separated from the livers and ducts were investigated under a surgical microscope. All observed ducts were examined microscopically and connective tissue cords were excluded. Bile ducts of Luschka locating near cystic fossa were found in 7 of 32 fetuses (21.9%). Three of the seven ducts ran towards to liver segment 5 (S5); three ducts were found in the gallbladder fossa; and one duct ran towards to liver segment 4 (S4). Also it was found that three of the seven ducts drained into the subsegmental duct of S5, two ducts drained into the right hepatic duct, one duct drained into the right anterior branch bile duct, and one duct drained into the subsegmental duct of S4. Subvesical ducts running along the gallbladder fossa between the gallbladder and the liver parenchyma were found in a relatively high incidence in fetuses than adults. Awareness and knowledge about incidence of such ducts alerts the surgeon during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therefore morbidity due to bile leaks can be reduced."

The demographic, clinical and operative reports data were collected. Eight cases were gastric GISTs, four cases were small bowel GISTs (jejunum 1 & ileum, 3) and GIST of the sigmoid colon was in one patient. Eight cases presented at the emergency department due to hematemesis (3), gastrointestinal obstruction (3), bowel perforation (1) and severe bleeding per rectum (1). Three cases presented with a feeling of abdominal fullness and ill-defined palpable abdominal mass. Two cases were discovered incidentally during GIT endoscopy for dyspepsia. Diagnosis of GISTs was presumed on clinical basis and operative findings from gross morphological features. Complete resection (R0) was achieved for 12 tumors (92.3%). The immunohistochemistry profile was positive for C-kit for all cases. One operative death was due to massive pulmonary embolism.

CD009323,0,19193661,0,Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia.,"Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (HH) occurs as a consequence of unregulated insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. In the newborn period it is the most common cause of severe and persistent hypoglycaemia. As HH is a major risk factor for brain injury and subsequent neurodevelopment handicap, the identification, rapid diagnosis and prompt management of patients with HH is essential if brain damage is to be avoided. Advances in molecular genetics, radiological imaging techniques (such as fluorine-18 L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography ((18F)DOPA-PET) scanning) and laparoscopic surgery have completely changed the clinical approach to infants with the severe congenital forms of HH.

The usual localizations of gastrinomas are at the head of the pancreas, the duodenal wall and the peripancreatic lymph nodes. Ectopic localizations, such as stomach, small bowel, gallbladder, liver or ovaries, are rare. We report the case of an intrahepatic gastrinoma, surgically treated by left hepatectomy. Upon review of scientific literature, we found 19 cases of intrahepatic gastrinoma. This diagnosis is always difficult to establish, even after a complete preoperative imaging and an extensive operative search for a possible primary tumor. The best evidence for diagnosis is the gastrinemia decreasing to a normal range after liver resection, and the absence of recurrence in long-term follow-up."

CD009323,0,19122940,0,Diagnostic transgastric flexible peritoneoscopy: is pure natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery a fantasy?,"We present the first transgastric peritoneoscopy in a 20-year-old man. The objectives were to evaluate the impact of the site of viscerotomy on the technical feasibility of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), assess transgastric peritoneoscopy as a complementary procedure, determine the safety and efficacy of NOTES, and attempt inspection/biopsy of the gallbladder. The patient was admitted with a benign gastric outlet obstruction, chronic cholecystitis and radiological suspicion of a mass in the gallbladder which was not visualised on diagnostic laparoscopy. Complementary transgastric peritoneoscopy was performed to gain deeper penetration of the tumour with the flexible tip of the gastroscope. The visceral ""aperture"" was created in the antrum where gastrojejunal anastomosis would be fashioned. Laparoscopic transillumination of the anterior gastric wall facilitated this part of the procedure. During transgastric peritoneoscopy, the gallbladder and structures in the upper and left hemi-abdomen appeared retrograde due to the unusual location of the gastrotomy. The right hemi-abdomen and pelvis were easily examined with a ""straight shaft"" approach. The gallbladder could not be identified with exploratory laparoscopy and transgastric peritoneoscopy. Due to risk of visceral injury, open gastrojejunal anastomosis and cholecystectomy were performed. Intraoperatively, an inflamed, thick-walled gallbladder was found adherent to the proximal duodenum. Transgastric peritoneoscopy was safely performed in our patient. The postoperative course was uneventful. Our patient showed significant improvement at 13 weeks after surgery without any procedure-related complication. In conclusion, transgastric peritoneoscopy may be used to complement diagnostic laparoscopy. Laparoscopic assistance during transluminal access facilitates simple tasks inside the peritoneal cavity to be performed safely."

The resections were performed because of diagnostic uncertainty to verify histological character of leasions at patients after previous operation of gastrointestinal tract for malignancy. Histological diagnosis was proved in 16 cases solitary liver cyst, in 7 cases of polycystic liver disease, one biliary cystadenoma and one retentive cyst. The reoperation of symptomatic solitary liver cyst was performed in one patient after 12 months from primary operation. The average follow-up of patients after surgical treatment was 41 months (5-96 months). Solitary liver cysts are indication to laparoscopic fenestration with biopsy in case of evidence of symptoms. Polycystic liver diseases are treated conservative and surgical treatment is indicated at outstanding and apparent symptomatology of this disease, where is possible to demonstrate preoperatively one or more dominant cysts."

To value the management of these tumors to the surgical clinic of Aristide Le Dantec hospital, authors achieved a retrospective survey on 8years (October 1994 to October 2002). Hundred twenty nine (129) cases of exocrine pancreatic tumors had been counted. It was about 71 men and 58 women of middle age of 56, 96 years. The length of middle evolution of the illness was of 8 months. The most frequent sign was jaundice, recovered at 80.9% of patients. Followed the thinning (79%), the pain (69%), the digestive stenosis (35%). Ultrasonography, scanner and x-ray of lungs permitted to make the diagnosis and the balance of extension. A laparoscopy had been made at 13 patients. A clinic and radiological classification had been used to distribute the tumors in 3 stages. At 46 patients in III stage, a therapeutic abstention had been decided. Patients to the II stage (n=77) had benefitted a palliative surgical treatment. It was about 74 biliary and digestive shunt and 3 alcoholic splanchnicectomy. The 6 patient to the I stage had benefitted a surgical resection. The middle hospitalization length was of 10.75 days. The rate of morbidity was 45.78%. Mortality was 29%. The median survival was of 3.6 months.

CD009323,0,19099267,0,[Minimally invasive resection of neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors].,"Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PET) are a heterogeneous group of lesions with an annual incidence of 0.1 to 0.4 per 100,000. They account for 2-4% of pancreatic neoplasms. Due to their mostly small size, some are suited to a laparoscopic approach. Preoperative localization, intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasonography, and considerable experience in pancreatic endocrine surgery and sophisticated laparoscopic techniques are essential for successful laparoscopic treatment of these tumors. If definite or highly suspicious signs of malignancy occur, a conventional open approach should be preferred. Insulinomas and small nonfunctioning PET in the pancreatic body or tail or near the surface of the pancreatic head and not in contact with the portal vein or the main pancreatic duct are suited to a laparoscopic approach. Patients with MEN1 who have insulinomas or small nonfunctioning PET may also benefit from a laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatic resection. Neither sporadic and MEN1-associated gastrinomas nor the very rare glucagonomas and vasoactive intestinal peptide-producing tumors (vipomas), which are often large and malignant, should also be tackled laparoscopically."

CD009323,0,19087053,0,Laparoscopic bile duct injury: understanding the psychology and heuristics of the error.,"Bile duct injury is an important unsolved problem of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, occurring with unacceptable frequency even in the hands of experienced surgeons. This suggests that a systemic predisposition to the injury is intrinsic to cholecystectomy and indicates that an analysis of the psychology and heuristics of surgical decision-making in relation to duct identification may be a guide to prevention. Review of published reports on laparoscopic bile duct injury from 1997 to 2007 was carried out. An analysis was also carried out of the circumstances of the injuries in 49 patients who had transection of an extrahepatic bile duct and who were referred for reconstruction or were assessed in a medicolegal context. Special emphasis was placed on identifying the possible psychological aspects of duct misidentification. Review of published work showed an emphasis on the technical aspects of correct identification of the cystic duct, with few papers addressing the heuristics and psychology of surgical decision-making during cholecystectomy. Duct misidentification was the cause of injury in 42 out of the 49 reviewed patients (86%). The injury was not recognized at operation in 70% and delay in recognition persisted into the postoperative period in 57%. Underestimation of risk, cue ambiguity and visual misperception ('seeing what you believe') were important factors in misidentification. Delay in recognition of the injury is a feature consistent with cognitive fixation and plan continuation, which help construct and sustain the duct misidentification during the operation and beyond. Changing the 'culture' of cholecystectomy is probably the most effective strategy for preventing laparoscopic bile duct injury, especially if combined with new technical approaches and an understanding of the heuristics and psychology of the duct misidentification error. Training of surgeons for laparoscopic cholecystectomy should emphasize the need to be alert for cues that the incorrect duct is being dissected or that a bile duct injury might have occurred. Surgeons may also be trained to accept the need for plan modification, to seek cues that refute a given hypothesis and to apply 'stopping rules' for modifying or converting the operation."

CD009323,0,19078884,0,Pancreas: what is the role of minimally invasive surgery?,"Advances in minimally invasive surgical technique, technology, and instrumentation have fostered the application of minimally invasive surgery to the management of pancreatic malignancies. Procedures such as laparoscopic staging and laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies that do not require complex reconstructions are feasible, safe, and appear to offer significant benefits in comparison to the comparable open procedures. Moreover, they can be taught to surgical trainees and can be readily disseminated beyond specialized centers. In contrast, more complex procedures such as laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy or central pancreatectomy have been safely performed in specialized centers, but their usefulness in comparison to open procedures remains to be defined. As laparoscopic skills and technology continue to improve, however, it is likely that such complex procedures will be performed with greater frequency. Future trials that confirm the safety and benefits of these advanced laparoscopic procedures in comparison to open procedures are therefore of paramount importance. Additionally, studies that specifically evaluate and compare the oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic and open pancreatic resections are needed."

CD009323,0,19030196,0,Cholangiocarcinoma: a compact review of the literature.,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is a devastating cancer arising from biliary epithelia. Unfortunately, the incidence of this disease is increasing in Western countries. These tumors progress insidiously, and liver failure, biliary sepsis, malnutrition and cancer cachexia are general modes of death associated with this disease. To date, no established therapy for advanced disease has been established or validated. However, our knowledge in tumor biology is increasing dramatically and new drugs are under investigation for treatment of this notorious tumor. In clinical practice, there are better diagnostic tools in use to facilitate an earlier diagnosis of CC, at least in those patients with known risk factors. CC is resectable for cure in only a small percentage of patients. Preoperative staging for vascular and biliary extension of CC is very important in this tumor. Laparoscopy and recently endosonography seem to protect against unnecessary laparotomies in these patients. During the last 15 years, aggressive surgical approaches, including combined liver resections and vascular reconstructive surgical expertise, have improved survival in patients with CC. Surgery is contraindicated in CC cases having primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Although CC was previously considered a contraindication to liver transplantation, new cautious protocols, including neo-adjuvant chemoradiation therapies and staging procedures before the transplantation, have made it possible to achieve long-term survival after liver transplantation in this disease. New ablative therapies with photodynamic therapy, intraductal high-intensity ultrasonography and chemotherapy-impregnated plastic biliary endoprosthesis are important steps in the palliative management of extra-hepatic CCs. Radiofrequency and chemo-embolization methods are also applicable for intra-hepatic CCs as palliative modes of treatment. We need more prospective randomized controlled trials to evaluate the role of the new emerging therapies for CC patients."
CD009323,0,19028662,0,[Modern esophageal surgery and late functional results as equations with several unknowns--Hungarian Academy of Sciences Doctoral Thesis].,"Using the same surgical method and anatomically ideal primary healing, the functional results could even be different later. Trying to identify various factors being responsible for the above differences, 637 patient's data, who underwent previous oesophago-gastric surgery between 1985-2005, were analyzed. Biochemical, histological and electrophysiological examinations had been evaluated. Developing hypertrophy-like metabolic changes and enteric ganglionitis as morphological alternations of LES muscles induced by GERD may be reasons for complaints after antireflux surgery. The marking of Z-line with endoscopic clips followed by an immediately upright contrast study and substractional evaluation is appropriate for detecting true short esophagus. Open surgical procedures are justified even in the new millennium in cases when the patient already underwent previous upper abdominal operations - due to an increased risk of injury because of adhesions - in cases of primarily recurrent paraesophageal hernias after an unsuccessful open and/or laparoscopic reconstruction, as well as in cases of reflux with complications. When adenocarcinomas of the gastro-oesophageal junction are examined preoperatively, the ratio of the performed catabolic - AMAN, CB, and DPP I - enzymatic activity of the tissue sample from the tumour and adjacent intact mucosa within 2 cm of the tumour may have a prognostic value even in the preoperative examination period, and neo-adjuvant treatment should be considered in these group of patients. The patients' post-operative complaints and symptoms change during the post-operative period and correlate with the parameters of the myoelectric and contractile activities of the ""Akiyama stomach"". Tachygastria seems to be the major pathogenetic factor involved in the contractile dysfunction. Gastro-jejuno-duodenal interposition represents an adequate 'second-best' method of choice if technical difficulties emerge with jejunal or colon interposition following limited resection of the oesophagus performed due to early Barrett's carcinoma or non-dilatable peptic stricture."

Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) with lymphadenectomy, including vascular resection, still presents the optimal surgical procedure for carcinomas in the head of pancreas. For patients with small or low-grade malignant neoplasms, as well as small pancreatic metastases located in the mid-portion of pancreas, central pancreatectomy (CP) is emerging as a safe and effective option with a low risk of developing de-novo exocrine and/or endocrine insufficiency. Total pancreatectomy (TP) is not as risky as it was years ago and can nowadays safely be performed, but its indication is limited to locally extended tumors that cannot be removed by PD or distal pancreatectomy (DP) with tumor free surgical margins. Consequently, TP has not been adopted as a routine procedure by most surgeons. On the other hand, an aggressive attitude is required in case of advanced distal pancreatic tumors, provided that safe and experienced surgery is available. Due to the development of modern instruments, laparoscopic operations became more and more successful, even in malignant pancreatic diseases.

As neoplastic disease is the most common indication for pancreatic resection, understanding the effects of the lap approach to pancreatectomy on cancer outcome is crucial. In addition to concerns of port-site tumor recurrence and tumor dissemination due to lap manipulation in the setting of pneumoperitoneum, adequacy of resection as defined by margin status and nodal assessment must be considered. This review covers the development and current state-of-the-art of lap pancreatic surgery for cancer. Existing data are reviewed for both open and lap pancreatic resections, with particular attention to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Projections of future advances in the field of lap pancreatic surgery are provided."
CD009323,0,18924072,0,Isolated enteric duplication cyst with respiratory epithelium: case report and review of the literature.,"Enteric duplication cysts are uncommon congenital abnormalities. We report a case of an enteric cyst duplication located a few centimeters proximal to the ileocecal valve in a patient with vague abdominal symptoms. Histological examination showed an ileal duplication cyst lined with ciliated bronchial epithelium. Duplication cysts of the alimentary tract are uncommon, and their epithelial lining varies. Bronchial respiratory epithelium is extremely rare at the terminal ileum. Our case is only the second case described in the literature."
CD009323,0,18922063,0,Laparoscopically assisted extrahepatic cyst excision and left hemihepatectomy for a type IV-A choledochal cyst.,"Some studies have reported on laparoscopic excision for treating the choledochal cyst, yet there are no reports on laparoscopic surgery for treating type IV-A choledochal cysts that require a liver resection. In this paper, we report on a case of laparoscopic cyst excision combined with left hemihepatectomy and laparoscopy-assisted Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy for treating a type IV-A choledochal cyst. A 51-year-old female was admitted with symptoms of jaundice and cholangitis. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) was done preoperatively for controlling the cholangitis. The imaging studies revealed a type IV-A choledochal cyst with an associated stricture of the left main intrahepatic duct. After the resolution of the cholangitis, total laparoscopic cyst excision and left hemihepatectomy were performed by using the four-port technique, and then a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was done by a laparoscopy-assisted method. The total operation time was 420 minutes. The estimated blood loss was 300 mL, and no perioperative transfusion was needed. The tubogram, which was performed through the PTBD on postoperative day 5, showed good patency of the bilioenteric anastomosis and no biliary leakage. The patient was discharged at postoperative day 7 without any complications. This case shows the feasibility of performing laparoscopic surgery for treating a type IV-A choledochal cyst that requires a liver resection. We believe that laparoscopic cyst excision with a liver resection can be one of the treatment options for selected patients with type IV-A choledochal cysts."
CD009323,0,18855999,0,Spontaneous necrosis of solid gallbladder adenocarcinoma accompanied with pancreaticobiliary maljunction.,"A 71-year-old Japanese man with acute cholecystitis and an incarcerated gallbladder (GB) stone was admitted. Plain ultrasonography (US) incidentally detected a mass-like lesion in the fundus. Doppler US revealed that this elevated lesion had no blood flow. Computed tomography showed a relatively low-density mass, measuring 5 cm multiply 4 cm in diameter, with no positive enhancement. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass in the fundus with a slightly low intensity on T1-weighted images and a slightly high intensity on T2-weighted images. We were agonized in making the qualitative diagnosis of mass-like lesions of the fundus, such as a benign tumor, cancer, or debris. We performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy, because the incarcerated GB stone clearly caused acute cholecystitis. Intra-operative cholangiography clearly revealed pancreaticobiliary maljunction. Amylase levels in the common bile duct and gallbladder were quite high. The elevated lesion in the fundus clearly showed severe necrosis. Although this necrotic nodule included non-viable adenocarcinoma cells, viable cancer cell nests were located in the muscularis propria and subcutaneous layer. Histopathological examination confirmed a solid adenocarcinoma. Thus, we diagnosed it as a gallbladder cancer, based on histopathological analysis of the resected specimen. We therefore undertook radical surgery, including wedge resection of the liver, radical dissection of regional lymph nodes, and resection of the extrahepatic bile duct. Histopathological findings revealed no cancer, hyperplasia or dysplasia in the additionally resected specimens. The patient was finally staged as T2, N0, H0, P0, M(-), stage II. We present the first case of spontaneous necrosis of solid gallbladder adenocarcinoma, with a review of previous studies."

CD009323,0,18820875,0,Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with conservation of the splenic artery and vein: report of three cases.,"Between March 2003 and March 2007, three patients with benign pancreatic tumors underwent a planned laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with conservation of the splenic artery and vein. Four trocars were placed, and an endoscopic linear stapler was used to transect of the pancreas. The perioperative data and surgical outcomes were examined. This procedure was successfully completed in three patients. The mean operative time was 158.3 min, with mean blood loss of 14.7 ml. The postoperative pathological diagnoses included one insulinoma, one solid pseudopapillary tumor, and one intraductal papillary-mucinous adenoma. The mean size of the tumors was 29.3 mm. Oral intake was initiated on day 1.7, and the length of postoperative hospital stay was 8.7 days on average. No morbidity or mortality was observed. A laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with conservation of the splenic artery and vein is a safe and feasible treatment option without compromising the splenic function for benign or borderline malignant tumors in the distal pancreas."
CD009323,0,18815848,0,Morbid obesity and subsequent pancreatic cancer: pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.,"Morbid obesity is a recognized risk factor for gastrointestinal cancer. Little is known about pancreatic cancer developing after gastric bypass surgery or about surgery for this type of tumor following bariatric surgery. This report describes a case of pancreatic head cancer identified 3 months after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity. During routine follow-up, mild abdominal pain and elevated pancreatic enzymes prompted computed tomography, which revealed mild edematous pancreatitis. Hyperbilirubinemia developed, and magnetic resonance imaging showed a pancreatic head tumor. CA19-9 was elevated. After a pylorus-preserving pancreatic head resection, the postoperative course was uneventful. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. Unfortunately, at the time of writing (9 months postoperatively), a local recurrence and hepatic metastases were diagnosed. Patients treated with bariatric surgery who develop new symptoms or report constant mild symptoms should be evaluated using endoscopy and radiomorphological imaging. Interdisciplinary obesity treatment can then offer significant benefits for the patient, particularly in the case of pancreatic cancer, which is still difficult to diagnose. In addition, there is a need for epidemiological studies of patients who undergo bariatric surgery and subsequently develop cancer."
CD009323,0,18813972,0,The role of staging laparoscopy for intraabdominal cancers: an evidence-based review.,"Diagnostic laparoscopy is minimally invasive surgery for the diagnosis of intraabdominal diseases. The aim of this review is a critical examination of the available literature on the role of laparoscopy for the staging of intraabdominal cancers. A systematic literature search of English-language articles on MEDLINE, the Cochrane database of evidence-based reviews, and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects was performed for the period 1995-2006. The level of evidence in the identified articles was graded. The search identified and reviewed seven main categories that have received attention in the literature: esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, biliary tract cancer, colorectal cancer, and lymphoma. The indications, contraindications, risks, benefits, diagnostic accuracy of the procedure, and its associated morbidity are discussed. The limitations of the available literature are highlighted, and evidence-based recommendations for the use of laparoscopy to stage intraabdominal cancers are provided."

CD009323,0,18807670,0,Intra-abdominal lesions could be missed by inadequate laparoscopy.,"Laparoscopic resection has become one of the choices for colectomy for various colon and rectal diseases in recent years. Despite some uncertainties of laparoscopic procedures, especially during cancer surgery, its popularity has forced surgeons to pursue the approach. One of the concerns is inadequate examination of the intra-abdominal organs with a laparoscope. This study is a retrospective analysis of a single surgeon's experience of the frequencies of unexpected findings during laparotomies. From July 1990 to November 2005, 2775 patients with various colorectal diseases receiving laparotomies by a single surgeon were analyzed. Among them, 2282 patients were operated for primary colorectal cancer. Excluded were patients who did not receive a formal laparotomy, who had a recent laparotomy, who had peritoneal and omental metastasis, and whose pathology did not attract attention for management. Exploration of the entire peritoneal cavity was performed for all cases in the series. There were 1423 males and 1352 females. Ages ranged from 12 to 94 years, averaging 62.6-years-old. Forty-six patients (1.7%) were found to have unexpected intra-abdominal lesions during laparotomies. Eleven patients were found to have synchronous colorectal cancers; five patients were found to have unexpected liver metastases; three patients each were found to have gastric cancers, stromal tumors of the small bowel, and ectopic pancreas; two patients each were found to have gastric leiomyosarcomas, pancreatic cancers, mucoceles of the appendix, ulcers of the small intestine, bleeding Meckel's diverticula, pancreatitis, and perforations of the ileum; one patient each was found to have gall bladder cancer, malignant carcinoid tumor, pheochromocytoma, diverticulitis of the jejunum, diverticulitis of the colon, duplication of the colon, and aortic aneurysm larger than 6 cm. Forty-one of the lesions were likely to be missed by laparoscope. This experience suggests that incomplete laparotomies might miss various pathologies. Laparoscopy is not a complete form of laparotomy because of loss of tactile sensation. Laparoscopy might result in an inadequate or inappropriate management due to misdiagnosis."

A subset of patients undergo laparoscopic intervention prior to PVE for staging purposes or to address the primary in Stage IV colon cancer. These patients usually undergo PVE as a subsequent additional procedure by the transhepatic route. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of portal vein ligation by the laparoscopic approach in suitable patients.
CD009323,0,18803517,0,Laparoscopic resection of an intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma in ectopic pancreatic tissue.,"Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) is a comparatively recently recognized pancreatic neoplasm with considerable malignant potential. Surgical removal is the only therapy known to provide a cure, but the extent of surgery required is still a matter of discussion. Ectopic pancreatic tissue can occur in a variety of other locations within the gastrointestinal tract and is also known to harbor pathologic conditions that affect normally located pancreatic tissue. In this paper, we present a case of an intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma arising within the ectopic pancreatic tissue in the wall of the proximal duodenum. The lesion was removed by a laparoscopic resection. We believe this to be the first described case of a malignant IPMN to arise within ectopic pancreatic tissue and also the first report of the laparoscopic removal of any ectopic pancreatic IPMN."

CD009323,0,18773068,0,Staging laparoscopy for cholangiocarcinoma.,"The precise role of laparoscopic assessment of biliary tract malignancy is yet to be defined. The evidence for its use has been reviewed to establish the role of laparoscopy for preoperative staging of cholangiocarcinoma. Published papers were reviewed for the evidence relevant to intrahepatic, proximal intrahepatic and distal biliary carcinoma. There is no randomized trial evaluating staging laparoscopy or laparoscopic ultrasound in the assessment of cholangiocarcinoma and the quality of the available data is extremely variable. There is a need for further studies to determine the specific role of laparoscopic staging of cholangiocarcinoma. The current standard of management should be to perform laparoscopic staging prior to proceeding to resection for patients with cholangiocarcinoma as it may prevent unnecessary laparotomy in up to 30% of patients. However, a selective approach identifying high-risk patients who will not benefit from surgical palliation may be more cost effective and future studies should be performed to identify such patients."

CD009323,0,18720776,0,Laparoscopically implanted tissue expander radiotherapy in canine transitional cell carcinoma.,"Organ motion and injury to adjacent structures limit curative treatment of intraabdominal tumors with external beam radiotherapy. We evaluated the use of Laparoscopically Implanted Tissue Expander Radiotherapy (LITE-RT) to exclude critical structures during irradiation of the urinary bladder in two dogs with transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) using helical tomotherapy. Dogs had histologically confirmed bladder TCC with no metastasis. A custom-shaped tissue expander was placed between the colon and bladder laparoscopically in one dog and during laparotomy in the other. The prescribed radiation dose was 45 Gy to 98% volume of the bladder in 18 fractions of 2.5 Gy. Tumor response and normal tissue effects were monitored with cystoscopy and colonic biopsies before treatment and 3, 6, and 15 months after treatment. Based on treatment plans from inflated vs. deflated tissue expander CT images, there was a mean dose reduction to the colon of 53% and 31% for the two dogs. Interfractional target repositioning was possible by using volumetric megavoltage computed tomography helical tomotherapy. Both dogs had no clinical signs of chronic colitis but did experience mild cystitis during treatment. Tissue expanders became detached, requiring an additional surgery for reattachment, in both dogs. One dog developed a fibrous adhesion resulting in bladder rupture during inflation, which necessitated early device removal. One dog was euthanized for tumor-associated ureteral obstruction at 8 months while the other is alive at 21 months. We conclude that LITE-RT shows promise in treatment of canine bladder TCC due to lack of acute colitis and enteritis."

CD009323,0,18716544,0,Completed laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy.,"A 55-year-old male patient, complaining of skin and sclera yellowing, came in for clinical investigation. After complete evaluation, the primitive diagnosis of periampullary carcinoma was made and radical surgical resection was planned to be performed. Later, a complete laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed successfully. The mean operating time was 510 minutes. The intraoperative blood loss was 800 mL without intraoperative blood transfusion. No complication was noticed. The length of postoperative hospital stay was 14 days. Pathologic examination showed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of common bile duct. The patient has been followed-up for 23 months. He is living very well and is capable of carrying on daily routine without any evidence of tumor recurrence. Despite long operating time, complete laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy is feasible. To develop this procedure as more clinical application, some special instruments or new technique for laparoscopic intracorporal biliojejunostomy or pancreatojejunostomy should be evolved, and a large number of clinical trials are also needed to prove its feasibility."
CD009323,0,18716530,0,Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and open distal pancreatectomy: a nonrandomized comparative study.,"Although laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) is technically feasible, its benefits remain uncertain. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical results of LDP and open distal pancreatectomy (ODP). The medical records of 14 consecutive patients who underwent LDP were reviewed and compared with those of 19 patients who underwent ODP. All patients were treated for benign or borderline malignant disease of the pancreas. Operation time was longer for LDP than for ODP (290.7 vs. 213.8 min, P=0.0022), and postoperative analgesics were administered less frequently for patients who underwent LDP. Patients treated by LDP had earlier recovery of bowel function, shorter time to oral intake, and shorter postoperative hospital stay than those treated by ODP. No difference in morbidity or inflammatory response was observed between the 2 groups. LDP for benign or borderline malignant disease of the pancreas provides benefits without increasing morbidity."

CD009323,0,18709785,0,Laparoscopic wedge resection for gastrointestinal stromal tumour of the duodenum.,"We report the case of a 40-year-old male patient who presented with melaena and acute anaemia. Endoscopic ultrasound examination revealed a lesion with a central depression measuring 2.5 cm, arising from the lateral wall of the second portion of the duodenum. Because of this rare location, a very invasive procedure (duodenopancreatectomy) might have been required for tumour resection. We avoided this operation and implemented an alternative solution. A laparoscopic wedge resection of the duodenal tumour was successfully completed. Operating time was 200 min and blood loss 50 ml. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3, after an uneventful postoperative recovery. Histopathologically, the tumour was diagnosed as a low-risk gastrointestinal stromal tumour. Despite the fact that laparoscopic surgery requires more complex technique than open surgery and the acquisition of advanced laparoscopic skills depending on prior laparoscopic experience, laparoscopic wedge resection should be considered as a valid treatment for duodenal stromal tumour."

A 55-year-old man was incidentally diagnosed as having a pancreatic tumor by abdominal ultrasonography. A hypoechoic cystic lesion was detected on the surface of the pancreatic body. A computed tomography revealed a cystic lesion surrounded by a smooth, flat wall. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the lesion was a low-intensity mass on the T1-image and a slightly high-intensity mass on the T2-image. The lesion was diagnosed as a benign cystic tumor, and enucleation of the tumor was scheduled. The fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed after laparotomy, and cytology of the contents was negative for malignant cells. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was a lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas. This cyst is an unusual but benign mass that requires minimal surgery."

CD009323,0,18668255,0,Chronic inflammatory changes seen in gallbladders of patients with pancreatico-biliary malunion years after transduodenal sphincterotomy: is it a precursor for gallbladder carcinoma?,"Common pancreaticobiliary channel malunion (PBM) is known to be associated with increased frequency of gallbladder (GB) cancer in adults. Few studies have reported the presence of histological changes in the GB following transduodenal drainage procedures in children with PBM. The aim of this study was to document the histological changes in the GB in children who underwent interval prophylactic cholecystectomy up to 18 years following PBM drainage procedure. All children who underwent open transduodenal sphincterotomy (TDS) for symptomatic PBM followed by prophylactic synchronous (open) and interval (laparoscopic) cholecystectomy between 1987 and 2007 were studied retrospectively. Eight children with PBM were identified. The median age at initial presentation and open transduodenal sphincterotomy was 8 months (1 month-3.5 years). The average interval between open TDS and prophylactic cholecystectomy was 5.5 years (0-18 years). Two children had synchronous TDS and cholecystectomy. At initial presentation, all patients presented with obstructive jaundice. Mild common bile duct dilatation was encountered in all patients. The dilated ducts returned to normal, and remained normal after transduodenal sphincterotomy. Histopathology in seven out of eight GB specimens (87.5%) showed microscopic evidence of chronic inflammation. Chronic cholecystitis (n = 7), Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses (n = 3), cholesterosis (n = 1) and intestinal metaplasia (n = 1) were observed in the GB biopsies. Only one patient, who had TDS and a synchronous cholecystectomy in the neonatal period, did not have histological changes in the GB. Average follow-up in years ranged between 3 months and 19 years (from TDS) with a median of 8 years, and between 3 months and 6 years (from cholecystectomy) with a median of 2 years. Chronic inflammatory changes were found in seven of eight GB specimens from patients with PBM despite previous drainage procedure in six patients and in one of two patients who underwent synchronous TDS and cholecystectomy. These changes may be the precursor of malignant transformation in GB of patients with PBM."

We report a case of synchronous multiple huge biliary mucinous cystadenomas with unique features. This is, according to our knowledge, the first report in the literature about three synchronously occurring hepatobiliary cystadenomas. Cystadenomas have a strong tendency to recur, particularly following incomplete excision, and a potential of malignant transformation.

Patient, 22 years old, since 7 years experiencing multiple incidents of neuroglycopenia with concurrent hyperadrenergic reaction. Consciousness disturbances and muscle tremor together with feeling of hunger and tachycardia occurred mainly in the morning hours, or after physical exercise, and subsided after glucose intake. Increase in body weight, typical for insulinoma, was also observed. The patient was hospitalized twice in Pediatric Department and although hypoglycemia was observed, no additional testing was performed to exclude insulinoma; reported symptoms and abnormalities in EEG recording after provocation resulted in diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. During hospitalization in the Department of Endocrinology fasting test was performed, which revealed inadequately high insulin level with glucose level of 41 mg% and signs of neuroglycopenia. The image of pancreas was normal in the acquired abdominal ultrasound and in CT a tumor was found in the tail of pancreas. The patient underwent laparoscopic operation and the clinical diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. Antiepileptic drugs were discontinued. Total remission of symptoms was achieved. The presented case demonstrates the difficulties in correct interpretation of reported symptoms, while the results of biochemical tests and imaging studies point precisely to the diagnosis. Focal neurological signs resulting from multiple episodes of hypoglycemia may lead to misdiagnosis and treatment of epilepsia."

The first case was a 59-year-old man, 3 months after a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for adenoma, presenting with diffuse abdominal pain. The patient was evaluated with a computed tomography scan revealing a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm (PA) bleeding into a pancreatic pseudocyst. He was emergently taken to the angiography suite where a covered stent was deployed at the level of splenic artery PA. The second case was a 52-year-old woman with recurrent left retroperitoneal mass 5 years after distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy for a nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumor. She underwent resection of the mass in the left upper quadrant. Postoperative course was complicated by hematoma, abscess formation, reexploration, and repair of the duodenotomy and the portal vein. Subsequently, she was noted to have intermittent gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which prompted an angiogram revealing a hepatic artery PA that was repaired with a covered balloon-expandable stent. A completion angiogram was obtained in each case demonstrating exclusion of the PA. Our experience with these 2 cases supports the notion that endovascular covered stenting is a safe and effective therapy for exclusion of visceral artery aneurysm."

This study was undertaken to assess feasibility and safety of minimal access resections of distal pancreas in benign, endocrine, and malignant diseases. Operative time, conversion rate, adequacy of dissection, respect for oncologic principles, morbidity rate, and short-term outcomes were analyzed. From the years 2002 to 2007, 14 patients affected by pancreatic neoplasm of body/tail region were approached by minimally invasive technique. Nine patients were affected by malignant neoplasms and distal splenopancreatectomy was successfully achieved by laparoscopy in 6. Five patients were affected by endocrine neoplasms; distal pancreatectomy with preservation of spleen and splenic vessels was achieved laparoscopically in 3, whereas 2 needed conversion to laparotomy.

CD009323,0,18563694,0,[Diagnosis and treatment of colorectal liver metastases - workflow].,"In this review, standards of diagnosis and treatment of colorectal liver metastases are described on the basis of a workshop discussion. Algorithms of care for patients with synchronous / metachronous colorectal liver metastases or locoregional recurrent tumour are presented. Surgical resection is the procedure of choice in the curative treatment of liver metastases. The decision about the resection of liver metastases should consider the following parameters: 1. General operability of the patient (comorbidity); 2. Achievability of an R 0 situation: i. if necessary, in combination with ablative methods, ii. if necessary, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, iii. the ability to eradicate extrahepatic tumour manifestations; 3. Sufficient volume of the liver remaining after resection (""future liver remnant = FLR): i. if necessary, in combination with portal vein embolisation or two-stage hepatectomy; 4. The feasibility to preserve two contiguous hepatic segments with adequate vascular inflow and outflow as well as biliary drainage; 5. Tumour biological aspects (""prognostic variables""); 6. Experience of the surgeon and centre! Extrahepatic disease does not contraindicate hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases provided a complete resection of both intra- and extrahepatic disease is feasible. Even in bilobar colorectal metastases and 5 or more tumours in the liver, a complete tumour resection has been described. The type of resection (hepatic wedge resection or anatomic resection) does not influence the recurrence rate. Preoperative volumetry is indicated when major hepatic resection is planned. The FLR should be 25 % in patients with normal liver, 40 % in patients who have received intensive chemotherapy or in cases of fatty liver, liver fibrosis or diabetes, and 50-60 % in patients with cirrhosis. In patients with initially unresectable colorectal liver metastases, preoperative chemotherapy enables complete resection in 15-30 % of the cases, whereas the value of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resectable liver metastases has not been sufficiently supported. In situ ablative procedures (radiofrequency ablation = RFA and laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy = LITT) are local therapy options in selected patients who are not candidates for resection (central recurrent liver metastases, bilobar multiple metastases and high-risk resection or restricted patient operability). Patients with tumours larger than 3 cm have a high local recurrence rate after percutaneous RFA and are not optimal candidates for this procedure. The physician's experience influences the results significantly, both after hepatectomy and after in situ ablation. Therefore, patients with colorectal liver metastases should be treated in centres with experience in liver surgery."

Lesions in the distal pancreas lend themselves well to laparoscopic resection. We reviewed our experience with laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. During the study period, 32 distal pancreatectomies were performed. There were 20 females. Mean patient age was 58.0 years (range, 23-83 years) and mean body mass index was 29.9 Kg/m2 (range, 19.9-44.7 Kg/m2). Technique was laparoscopic (25) or hand-assisted (seven) with one conversion in each group. The spleen was preserved in six patients (18.8%). Mean operative time overall was 238 minutes (range, 140-515 minutes); hand-assisted was 222 minutes and laparoscopic was 254 minutes. Estimated blood loss averaged 221 mL (range, 50-1800 mL). Mean tumor size was 2.7 cm (range, 0.6-7 cm). Tumor pathology was serous cystadenoma (10), neuroendocrine tumor (six), mucinous cystic neoplasm (four), intrapapillary mucinous neoplasm (four), adenocarcinoma (three), other (four), and solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (one). Mean length of stay was 5 days (range, 3-11 days). Complications were pancreatic fistula (six), wound infection (two), pulmonary embolism (one), pancreatitis (one), myocardial infarction (one), postoperative bleed from combined laparoscopic bilateral oophorectomy (one), and pancreatic stump staple line bleed requiring reoperation (one).

CD009323,0,18535766,0,Error traps and vasculo-biliary injury in laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy.,"Many biliary misidentification injuries occur due to error traps-methods that work well in most circumstances but which are apt to under certain conditions. We have identified four such traps from an extensive experience in repair of biliary injuries. The most common cause of misidentification results from the ""infundibular technique"" error trap. This problem is usually associated with severe inflammation which hides the cystic duct and obliterates the triangle of Calot making the common hepatic duct appear to be part to the gallbladder wall. Another error trap -- the ""fundus-down"" cholecystectomy has been associated with injuries in which the vascular component of the injury has been even more serious than the biliary one ie, ""vasculo-biliary injuries"" These vasulo-biliary injuries result in hepatic infarction requiring liver resection, possibly including transplantation. As opposed to the infundibular technique error trap the fundus down error trap usually occurs at open cholecystectomy after conversion. The two other error traps are due to failure to perceive the presence of an aberrant right hepatic duct on cholangiography and injury to the common bile duct in the case of a ""parallel union"" cystic duct. Knowledge of these error traps and their avoidance can help to reduce the incidence of biliary injuries."

CD009323,0,18493547,0,Strategies for management of bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"We encountered 10 patients with bile duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Their causes were electrocautery in 2 patients, misjudgment in 2, mechanical injury in 3, aberrant bile duct in 2, and weakness of the bile duct wall in one. The sites of injury were cystic duct in 4 patients, common bile duct in 2, aberrant bile duct in 2, common hepatic duct in one, and common bile duct plus right hepatic duct in one. Treatments for the injuries discovered intraoperatively consisted of T-tube drainage above in 2 patients, re-ligation of the cystic duct in one, ligation of an aberrant bile duct in one, simple suture and T-tube in one, and choledochojejunostomy in one. In the remaining 4 patients discovered postoperatively, 2 were conservatively treated by endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage. The duration of hospitalization was 9-12 days in the 4 patients with simple suture or ligation, 10-21 days in 2 cases of bile drainage, and 34-43 days in 3 with T-tube drainage. The patient with choledochojejunostomy suffered repeated cholangitis, resulting in hepatic abscess with hospitalization for 6 months.

CD009323,0,18491187,0,Laparoscopic intraluminal surgery for gastrointestinal malignancies.,"Intraluminal surgery began with the advent of endoscopy. Endoscopic endoluminal surgery has limitations; and its failure results in conventional open or laparoscopic interventions with increased morbidity. Laparoscopy-assisted intraluminal surgery is a novel alternative to open or laparoscopic surgery for a failed endoscopic endoluminal technique, minimizing the associated complications. Endoscopic resection of early gastric and duodenal cancers is restricted by the limited view of the endoscope, insufficient number of instrument channels, and inability to have adequate margins of resection without risking perforation. These cancers potentially can be treated by laparoscopy-assisted intraluminal surgery without resorting to major gastric or duodenal resection. This procedure is relatively easy to perform and oncologically effective.

CD009323,0,18481497,0,Is splenectomy after trauma an endangered species?,"Nonoperative management of splenic trauma is now the most common treatment modality for splenic injuries and splenectomy has almost disappeared in some trauma centers. Splenectomy for cancer staging is infrequently performed suggesting that the indications for splenectomy continue to evolve. We evaluated a state database to assess a communitywide experience with splenic surgery. International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes were used to determine the indication for splenic surgery. Indications for splenic surgery were listed as trauma (injury codes), medical (hematological diseases, neoplasms, or procedures in which the spleen might be removed contiguously like distal pancreatectomy), or incidental (noncontiguous procedures). Splenectomies for medical indications (n = 607, 43%) were more common than splenectomies for trauma (n = 518, 37%) or incidental splenectomies (n = 276, 20%). Splenectomy for medical reasons was associated with hematologic disease in 56 per cent, neoplastic disease in 34 per cent, and other diagnoses in 10 per cent of cases. Incidental splenectomies were most commonly associated with operations on the esophagus/stomach (32%) and colon (30%). Mortality rate and length of stay were greatest for incidental (14.4 +/- 0.9 days, 10.9% mortality) compared with trauma (11.0 +/- 0.5 days, 7.7% mortality) or medical (9.7 +/- 0.4 days, 4.8% mortality) splenectomies (all P < 0.05 versus incidental).

CD009323,0,18458911,0,Staging of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.,"Preoperative staging of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is important in determining the best treatment plan. Several classification systems have been suggested to determine the operability and extent of surgery. Longitudinal tumor extent is especially important in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma because operative methods differ depending on the tumor extent. The Bismuth-Corlette classification system provides useful information when planning for surgery. However, this classification system is not adequate for selecting surgical candidates. Anatomic variation of the bile duct and gross morphology of the tumor must be considered simultaneously. Lateral spread of the tumor can be evaluated based on the TNM staging provided by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). However, there is a potential for ambiguity in the distinction of T1 and T2 cancer from one another. In addition, T stage does not necessarily mean invasiveness. Blumgart T staging is helpful for the assessment of resectability with the consideration of nodal status and distant metastasis as suggested by the AJCC cancer staging system. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the primary tools used in the assessment of longitudinal and lateral spread of a tumor when determining respectability. Diagnostic laparoscopy and positron emission tomography (PET) may play additional roles in this regard."

In this way, patients with biliary pancreatitis require emergency operative treatment with use of endoscopic interventions without dependence from a stage of disease. To patients with alcoholic or alimentary pancreatitis in the stage of enzymatic toxemia conservative treatment should be spent only, until shock and/or delirium won't be reduced. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography + endoscopic papillosphincterotomy with concrement removal from common bile duct--is the operation of choice in case of acute biliary pancreatitis at the first stage. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the operation of choice at the second stage of disease. At destructive pancreatitis of other origin in a stage of the infection or necrotic suppurative inflammation use of open and closed small invasive methods of intervention is most proved.

Both were initially diagnosed as renal cell carcinoma. The first case was a 30-year-old woman who presented with right flank soreness. Ultrasonography disclosed a multiloculated cystic tumor measuring 9 x 7 cm. She underwent hand-assisted laparoscopic radical nephrectomy; there was no recurrence during 15 months of follow-up. The second case was a 49-year-old woman who presented with a palpable mass in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen of 1 month's duration. Computed tomography showed a heterogeneously enhanced tumor measuring 13 x 11 cm at the left retroperitoneum with displacement of the pancreas and the left kidney. Hand-assisted retroperitoneoscopic radical nephrectomy was performed. She had no evidence of recurrence after 27 months of follow-up. Pathology of the two cases showed histologic and immunochemical features of synovial sarcoma with coexisting spindle and epithelial cells.

CD009323,0,18393150,0,A facilitated method for endoscopic interventions at the bile duct after Roux-en-Y reconstruction using double balloon enteroscopy.,"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) after Roux-en-Y reconstruction and modified BII surgery or duodenopancreatectomy is considerably more difficult than ERC under normal anatomic conditions. If the common bile in the afferent loop cannot be reached by a common lateral-viewing duodenoscope because of excessive intestinal length, it has recently become possible to use double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) for ERC to reach the common bile duct. Cannulating the bile duct via DBE in these postoperative settings remains one of the most difficult ERCP manipulations because of the lack of an Albarran lever and the use of extra long ERCP accessories. Here, we report on a facilitated method for endoscopic interventions at the bile duct in postoperative settings with a long afferent loop using DBE. For facilitation of interventions the enteroscope can be exchanged for a 110-cm-long conventional gastroscope after incision of the overtube in three quarters of its circumference. Care has to be taken that the pressure line for the balloon remains intact. The huge benefit of this facilitated method is the use of standard endoscopic material like guides, catheters and papillotomes."

CD009323,0,18389748,0,[Our experience in the management of patients with Mirizzi syndrome].,"The authors report their experience in the management of patients with Mirizzi Syndrome (MS) admitted, over a period of 15 years, at the General Surgery of Emergency Department of Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy. All patients were admitted and surgically treated in emergency save for one. Out of 12 patients, cholecystectomy was performed in 7 cases. In others 5 patients, with cholecystocholedochal fistula, cholecystectomy with positionig of T-Tube was performed in 4 cases (MS-II); finally, 1 patient with MS type III undewrwent choledochojejunostomy. According to literature, the diagnostic protocol included abdominal ultrasonography and CT scan of the abdomen for all patients; in one case, a cholangio-MRI was performed to clarify the diagnosis. The preoperative diagnosis is essential to reduce risk of iatrogenic injuries. The cholangio-MRI, used to this extent, clarifies the site of obstruction, shows the anatomy of the biliary tree and allows to make all the possible differential diagnoses in order to exclude the presence of biliary tumors before surgery. The intraoperative cholangiography remains mandatory to clarify the anatomy of the biliary tree. In the cases we have treated, ERCP was never performed. We believe that ERCP has limited indications and unsatisfactory outcomes for both diagnosis and treatment of MS. Pathological examination of the fresh-frozen surgical specimens was always performed intraoperatively to exclude the presence of concomitant cancer of the gallbladder. The traditional treatment of patients with MS is surgery, as confirmed by our experience. We perform cholecystectomy for MS type I and cholecystectomy with direct repair of the biliary fistula over aT tube for MS type II. Patients with MS type III usually undergo a tailored operation based on the intraoperative findings, while choledochojejunostomy is mandatory for patients with MS type IV. Laparoscopic surgery is indicated only for MS type I and II. It seems to carry a higher risk for the patient and we do not use this approach in the emergency settings."

Experience with 3 cases].,"Laparoscopic treatment of lesions of the distal pancreas has gained favour worldwide in the last decade. The objective of this study was to analyze 3 cases of insulinoma successfully treated with the laparoscopic approach. From 2000 to 2007 in our institution 3 patients with insulinoma of the left pancreas were treated with a laparoscopic approach. The insulinoma was diagnosed by helical CT scan, Two cases were treated by left pancreatectomy and one by enucleation. The resections were achieved by laparoscopy with no conversion to laparotomy. There were no intraoperative complications. Average blood loss was 180 mi (range: 150-350). Mean operative time was 232 minutes (range: 225-240). Morbidity consisted in one mild pancreatic fistula after left pancreatectomy that was healed by conservative treatment after 24 days. The mean hospital stay was 13 days (range: 10-20). During the follow-up insulinoma symptoms have disappeared in all patients. This study confirms the feasibility of laparoscopic resection for insulinoma. Operative times were quite acceptable and the conversion rate was nil. Times to oral intake and walking were shorter than after open surgery, as was the mean postoperative hospital stay."

CD009323,0,18376299,0,Diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts in chronic pancreatitis.,"Pancreatic pseudocysts are a well-known complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis, with a higher incidence in the latter. Diagnosis is accomplished most often by computed tomographic scanning, by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or by ultrasound, and a rapid progress in the improvement of diagnostic tools enables detection with high sensitivity and specificity. Different strategies contribute to the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts: endoscopic transpapillary or transmural drainage, percutaneous catheter drainage, or open surgery. The feasibility of endoscopic drainage is highly dependent on the anatomy and topography of the pseudocyst, but provides high success and low complication rates. Percutaneous drainage is used for infected pseudocysts. However, its usefulness in chronic pancreatitis-associated pseudocysts is questionable. Internal drainage and pseudocyst resection are frequently used as surgical approaches with a good overall outcome, but a somewhat higher morbidity and mortality compared with endoscopic intervention. We therefore conclude that pseudocyst treatment in chronic pancreatitis can be effectively achieved by both endoscopic and surgical means. This review entails publications referring to the classification of pancreatic pseudocysts, epidemiology, diagnostic tools, and therapeutic options for pancreatic pseudocysts. Only full articles were considered for the review. Based on a search in PubMed, the MeSH terms ""pancreatic pseudocysts and classification,"" ""diagnosis,"" and ""endoscopic, percutaneous, and surgical treatment"" were used either alone or in combination."

CD009323,0,18349445,0,Vascular and biliary variants in the liver: implications for liver surgery.,"Accurate preoperative assessment of the hepatic vascular and biliary anatomy is essential to ensure safe and successful hepatic surgery. Such surgical procedures range from the more complex, like tumor resection and partial hepatectomy for living donor liver transplantation, to others performed more routinely, like laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Modern noninvasive diagnostic imaging techniques, such as multidetector computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed with liver-specific contrast agents with biliary excretion, have replaced conventional angiography and endoscopic cholangiography for evaluation of the hepatic vascular and biliary anatomy. These techniques help determine the best hepatectomy plane and help identify patients in whom additional surgical steps will be required. Preoperative knowledge of hepatic vascular and biliary anatomic variants is mandatory for surgical planning and to help reduce postoperative complications. Multidetector CT and MR imaging, with the added value of image postprocessing, allow accurate identification of areas at risk for venous congestion or devascularization.

CD009323,0,18345286,0,Stent versus surgery.,"Following the introduction of percutaneous and endoscopic biliary drainage there has been an ongoing debate about the indications and outcomes of endoscopic versus surgical drainage in a variety of bilio-pancreatic disorders. The evidence-based literature concerning four different areas of pancreatobiliary diseases have been reviewed. Preoperative endoscopic biliary drainage in patients with obstructive jaundice should not be used routinely but only in selected patients. For patients with biliary leakage and bile duct strictures after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, endoscopic stent therapy might be first choice and surgery should be used for failures of endoscopic treatment. Surgery is the treatment of choice after transection of the bile duct (the major bile duct injuries). The majority of patients with obstructive jaundice due to advanced pancreatic cancer will undergo endoscopic drainage but for relatively fit patients with a prognosis of more than 6 months, surgical drainage or even palliative resection might be considered. For patients with persistent pain due to chronic pancreatitis surgical drainage combined with limited pancreatic head resection might be first choice for pain relief. Most importantly, the management of patients with these pancreatobiliary diseases should be performed by a multidisciplinary HPB approach and teamwork consisting of gastroenterologists, radiologists and surgeons."

CD009323,0,18334431,0,Intraoperative laparoscope augmentation for port placement and resection planning in minimally invasive liver resection.,"In recent years, an increasing number of liver tumor indications were treated by minimally invasive laparoscopic resection. Besides the restricted view, two major intraoperative issues in laparoscopic liver resection are the optimal planning of ports as well as the enhanced visualization of (hidden) vessels, which supply the tumorous liver segment and thus need to be divided (e.g., clipped) prior to the resection. We propose an intuitive and precise method to plan the placement of ports. Preoperatively, self-adhesive fiducials are affixed to the patient's skin and a computed tomography (CT) data set is acquired while contrasting the liver vessels. Immediately prior to the intervention, the laparoscope is moved around these fiducials, which are automatically reconstructed to register the patient to its preoperative imaging data set. This enables the simulation of a camera flight through the patient's interior along the laparoscope's or instruments' axes to easily validate potential ports. Intraoperatively, surgeons need to update their surgical planning based on actual patient data after organ deformations mainly caused by application of carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum. Therefore, preoperative imaging data can hardly be used. Instead, we propose to use an optically tracked mobile C-arm providing cone-beam CT imaging capability intraoperatively. After patient positioning, port placement, and carbon dioxide insufflation, the liver vessels are contrasted and a 3-D volume is reconstructed during patient exhalation. Without any further need for patient registration, the reconstructed volume can be directly augmented on the live laparoscope video, since prior calibration enables both the volume and the laparoscope to be positioned and oriented in the tracking coordinate frame.

CD009323,0,18333201,0,Preoperative optimization of the liver for resection in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.,"Optimal preoperative preparation is required to reduce operative risk of major hepatectomy in jaundiced patients. The role of percutaneous preoperative biliary drainage (PTBD) is, apart from assessment of intraductal extent of the tumour, to allow contralateral hypertrophy if portal vein embolization (PVE) is performed. The increased use of PTBD over a 10-year period was associated with increased resectability rate in this study, while PTBD-related complications decreased. Efficient hypertrophy of the future liver remnant (FLR) requires biliary drainage to reduce the risk of postoperative liver dysfunction. Preoperative staging laparoscopy avoided unnecessary surgical exploration in 20% of patients previously considered resectable."
CD009323,0,18333200,0,Hilar cholangiocarcinoma: diagnosis and staging.,"Cancer arising from the proximal biliary tree, or hilar cholangiocarcinoma, remains a difficult clinical problem. Significant experience with these uncommon tumors has been limited to a small number of centers, which has greatly hindered progress. Complete resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the most effective and only potentially curative therapy, and it now clear that concomitant hepatic resection is required in most cases. Simply stated, long-term survival is generally possible only with an en bloc resection of the liver with the extrahepatic biliary apparatus, leaving behind a well perfused liver remnant with adequate biliary-enteric drainage. Preoperative imaging studies should aim to assess this possibility and must evaluate a number of tumor-related factors that influence resectability. Advances in imaging technology have improved patient selection, but a large proportion of patients are found to have unresectable disease only at the time of exploration. Staging laparoscopy and (13)fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) may help to identify some patients with advanced disease; however, local tumor extent, an equally critical determinant of resectability, may be underestimated on preoperative studies. This paper reviews issues pertaining to diagnosis and preoperative evaluation of patients with hilar biliary obstruction. Knowledge of the imaging features of hilar tumors, particularly as they pertain to resectability, is of obvious importance for clinicians managing these patients."
CD009323,0,18333170,0,Distal pancreatectomy: en-bloc splenectomy vs spleen-preserving pancreatectomy.,"Distal pancreatectomy with en-bloc splenectomy has been considered the standard technique for management of benign and malignant pancreatic disorders. However, splenic preservation has recently been advocated. The aim of this study was to review the experiences of distal pancreatectomy using the open or the laparoscopic approach and to critically discuss the need to perform splenectomy. Original articles published in the English literature of peer-reviewed medical journals were selected for detailed analysis. In patients with malignant neoplasms in the body-tail of the pancreas, splenectomy has a negative influence on long-term survival after resection. The incidence of diabetes after spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy for chronic pancreatitis is less than after en-bloc splenectomy. Spleen salvage eliminates the risk of overwhelming infections. Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy is feasible and safe. Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy may be preferable for the advantages of a minimally invasive approach."

CD009323,0,18333077,0,Laparoscopic management of benign liver diseases: where are we?,"The role of laparoscopic surgery in the management of benign cystic and solid liver tumours appears to differ according to each tumour type. As regards congenital liver cysts, laparoscopic treatment is now the gold standard for treating selected, huge, accessible, highly symptomatic or complicated cysts. In contrast, the laparoscopic approach is not useful for patients suffering from adult polycystic liver disease (PLD), except for type I PLD with large multiple hepatic cysts. For benign hepatocellular tumours, the surgical management has recently benefited from a better knowledge of the natural history of each type of tumour and from the improvement of imaging techniques in assuring a precise diagnosis of tumour nature. Thus the general tendency has led to a progressive restriction and tailoring of indications for resection in benign liver tumours, selecting only patients with huge, specifically symptomatic or compressive benign tumours or patients suffering from liver cell adenoma. Despite the enthusiastic use of the laparoscopic approach, selective indications for resection of benign liver tumours should indeed remain unchanged. For all types of benign liver tumours, the best indication remains small, superficial lesions, located in the anterior or the lateral segments of the liver. Deep, centrally located lesions or tumours in contact with major vascular or biliary trunks are not ideal candidates for laparoscopic liver resections. When performed by expert liver and laparoscopic surgeons using an adequate surgical technique, the laparoscopic approach is safe for performing minor liver resections and is accompanied by the usual postoperative benefits of laparoscopic surgery. When applied in selected patients and tumours, laparoscopic management of benign liver diseases appears to be a promising technique for hepatobiliary surgeons."
CD009323,0,18333037,0,Preoperative staging and evaluation of resectability in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,"Cancer of the pancreas is a common disease, but the large majority of patients have tumours that are irresectable at the time of diagnosis. Moreover, patients whose tumours are clearly beyond surgical cure are best treated non-operatively, if possible, by relief of biliary obstruction and percutaneous biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and then consideration of oncological treatment, notably chemotherapy. These facts underline the importance of a standard protocol for the preoperative determination of operability (is it worth operating?) and resectability (is there a chance that the tumour can be removed?). Recent years have seen the advent of many new techniques, both radiological and endoscopic, for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. It would be impracticable in time and cost to submit every patient to every test.

CD009323,0,18321433,0,Gallstone disease: current therapeutic practice.,Most asymptomatic gallstone carriers require no therapy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the best definitive therapy for symptomatic gallstone disease. Selective laparoscopic cholecystectomy can provide secondary prevention of symptoms and complications in certain instances (in a complex clinical setting such as sickle cell disease or to prevent gallbladder carcinoma from developing in those at risk with large gallstones or with a calcified gallbladder). Primary prevention is unproven but focuses on early identification and risk alteration to decrease the possibility of developing gallstones. Ursodeoxycholic acid has a limited role for stone dissolution but can prevent stone development in severe obesity during rapid weight reduction with diet or after bariatric surgery.

More than 3000 patients who underwent elective surgery of the digestive system were studied. Cefazolin or cefotiam was used as the prophylactic antibiotic. The number of patients, sex, age, clinical stage, incidence of surgical site infection (SSI), isolated bacteria, distal pancreatectomy with or without gastrectomy, the rate of laparoscopic surgery, and the rate of abdominoperineal resection (APR) were examined in a prospective controlled study over three time periods. There were no significant differences in the demographics of patients in the three periods. The duration of antibiotic administration was 96.1 +/- 11.2 h in period A, 18.2 +/- 2.7 h in period B, and 66.9 +/- 11.1 hours in period C (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of SSI in the three periods. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was isolated from the infectious site in 0.47% of patients in period A, and from 2.1% and 0.34% of patients in periods B and C, respectively, and the incidence of MRSA was significantly higher in period B as compared with periods A and C (P < 0.01). The isolation rates of MRSA and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) were both significantly higher in period B patients (P < 0.005). We concluded that the administration of prophylactic antibiotics within 24 h of surgery increased the rate of isolation of MRSA."

CD009323,0,18287976,0,Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy: a retrospective review of 19 cases.,"The role of laparoscopic techniques in pancreatic surgery is still controversial especially regarding to exocrine malignancies. Operative time, conversion rate, adequacy of dissection, and morbidity do represent factors of major concern. Whereas laparoscopic resection of left sided pancreatic lesions requires no anastomosis and therefore has gained worldwide acceptance over the last years, excision of cephalic lesions by mimimal access has little place in surgeons' practice because of its technical complexity and duration of surgery. This study was designed to assess the feasibility and results of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy for neoplasms of the pancreatic head, analyzing steps of learning curve, conversion rate, and short-term outcomes. From August 2002 to December 2006, 19 patients affected by pancreatic neoplasm of the head were approached by minimally invasive technique. A video-assisted procedure with pancreaticoduodenal resection and anastomoses fashioned through a midline minilaparotomy of 7 cm was achieved in 7 patients. Conversion to laparotomy was required in 6 patients, in 3 for bleeding and in 3 for difficulties in dissection. Cephalic pancreatoduodenectomy was achieved by thorough intracorporeal technique in 6 patients. Mortality was nil. Oncologic principles with adequate lymphadenectomy and resection margins were respected and short-term outcomes and mean survival were quite acceptable and equal to those of conventional surgery."

CD009323,0,18274843,0,Guidelines for the management of biliary tract and ampullary carcinomas: surgical treatment.,"The only curative treatment in biliary tract cancer is surgical treatment. Therefore, the suitability of curative resection should be investigated in the first place. In the presence of metastasis to the liver, lung, peritoneum, or distant lymph nodes, curative resection is not suitable. No definite consensus has been reached on local extension factors and curability. Measures of hepatic functional reserve in the jaundiced liver include future liver remnant volume and the indocyanine green (ICG) clearance test. Preoperative portal vein embolization may be considered in patients in whom right hepatectomy or more, or hepatectomy with a resection rate exceeding 50%-60% is planned. Postoperative complications and surgery-related mortality may be reduced with the use of portal vein embolization. Although hepatectomy and/or pancreaticoduodenectomy are preferable for the curative resection of bile duct cancer, extrahepatic bile duct resection alone is also considered in patients for whom it is judged that curative resection would be achieved after a strict diagnosis of its local extension. Also, combined caudate lobe resection is recommended for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Because the prognosis of patients treated with combined portal vein resection is significantly better than that of unresected patients, combined portal vein resection may be carried out. Prognostic factors after resection for bile duct cancer include positive surgical margins, especially in the ductal stump; lymph node metastasis; perineural invasion; and combined vascular resection due to portal vein and/or hepatic artery invasion. For patients with suspected gallbladder cancer, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not recommended, and open cholecystectomy should be performed as a rule. When gallbladder cancer invading the subserosal layer or deeper has been detected after simple cholecystectomy, additional resection should be considered. Prognostic factors after resection for gallbladder cancer include the depth of mural invasion; lymph node metastasis; extramural extension, especially into the hepatoduodenal ligament; perineural invasion; and the degree of curability. Pancreaticoduodenectomy is indicated for ampullary carcinoma, and limited operation is also indicated for carcinoma in adenoma. The prognostic factors after resection for ampullary carcinoma include lymph node metastasis, pancreatic invasion, and perineural invasion."

CD009323,0,18264824,0,Is laparoscopic resection adequate in patients with neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors?,"Since the first reports with laparoscopic resection of islet cell tumors in 1996, the experience worldwide is still limited, with only short-term outcomes available. Some have suggested that a malignant tumor is a contraindication to laparoscopic resection. Aim The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and long-term outcome of the laparoscopic approach in patients with functioning, nonfunctioning, or overt malignant pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNT). To our knowledge this is the largest single-institution series on this subject to date. Patients and methods A total of 49 consecutive patients (43 women, 6 men; mean age 58 years, range 22-83 years) underwent laparoscopic pancreatic surgery (LPS) from April 1998 to June 2007. Preoperative localization was done by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic ultrasonography, and Octreoscan imaging. Other than 9 PNTs localized in the head of the pancreas, all tumors were located in the left pancreas. Malignancy was diagnosed based on the presence of lymph nodes or liver metastasis. There were 33 patients with functioning tumors: 4 with gastrinomas (mean size 1.2 cm), 1 with a glucagonoma (4 cm), 3 with vipomas (3.2 cm), 2 with carcinoids (5.2 cm), 20 with sporadic insulinomas (1.4 cm), 2 with insulinoma/multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) (4.4 cm), and 1 with a malignant insulinoma (13 cm). Sixteen patients had a nonfunctioning tumor (mean size 5 cm). The following techniques were performed: laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (Lap SPDP), laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy (Lap SxDP) and laparoscopic enucleation (Lap En)/laparoscopic excision (Lap E). Lymph node dissection was performed when malignancy was suspected (Strasberg s technique). Evaluation criteria included operative and postoperative factors, pathologic data including R0 or R1 resection (the pancreatic transection margin and all transection margins on the specimen were inked). Long-term outcomes were analyzed by tumor recurrence and patient survival. Results Four cases (8.2%) were converted to open surgery. Overall, Lap SPDP, Lap SxDP, and Lap En/Lap E were performed in 15 (33.3%), 8 (17.8%), and 22 (48.9%) patients, respectively. The operative time and blood loss was significantly lower in the Lap En group compared with the other laparoscopic techniques. The group of patients with malignant tumors undergoing Lap SxDP had a longer operating time and greater blood loss compared with the other distal pancreatectomy (Lap DP) techniques. Overall, the postoperative complications were significantly higher in the Lap En group (42.8%) than in the Lap DP (Lap SPDP+Lap SxDP) group (22%). These complications were mainly pancreatic fistula: 8.7% after Lap DP and 38% after Lap En. The overall morbidity was significantly higher after Lap SPDP (26.7%) than after Lap SxDP (12.5%) owing to the occurrence of splenic complications in the Lap SPDP group without splenic vessel preservation two of seven (28.5%). The means and ranges of hospital stay after Lap SPDP, Lap SxDP, and Lap En/Lap E were 5.9 (5-14), 7.5 (5-12), and 5.5 (5-7) days, respectively (NS). Pathology examination of the specimen showed R0 resection in all patients with malignant PNT. The mean time to resumption of previous activities for patients undergoing Lap DP or Lap En was 3 weeks. There were no postoperative (30 days) or hospital deaths. Conclusions This series demonstrates that LPS is feasible and safe in benign-appearing and malignant neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors (NEPTs). The benefits of minimally invasive surgery were manifest in the short hospital stay and acceptable pancreas-related complications in high-risk patients. LPS can achieve negative tangential margins in a high percentage of patients with malignant tumors. Although surgical cure is rare in malignant NEPTs, significant long-term palliation can be achieved in a large proportion of patients with an aggressive surgical approach."

Despite all efforts, an occult insulinoma (occult insulinoma refers to a biochemically proven tumor with indeterminate anatomical site before operation) may still be encountered. New localization preoperative techniques decreases occult cases and the knowledge of the site of the mass before surgery allows to determine whether enucleation of the tumor or pancreatic resection is likely to be required and whether the tumor is amenable to removal via a laparoscopic approach. In absence of preoperative localization and intraoperative detection of an insulinoma, blind pancreatic resection is not recommended."
CD009323,0,18203934,0,Evaluation of biliary abnormalities with 64-channel multidetector CT.,"Precise preoperative assessment of the vascular and biliary anatomy is important in ensuring the safety of hepatobiliary surgical procedures, including laparoscopic cholecystectomy, living donor liver transplantation, and tumor resection of the liver. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography clearly depict the biliary anatomy but are considered invasive procedures. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is noninvasive but sometimes fails to depict the normal intrahepatic bile ducts. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) has contributed greatly to the evaluation of the normal anatomy, anatomic variants, and disease extent in this setting. With 64-channel multidetector CT, high-resolution three-dimensional images can be reconstructed from isotropic data with a 0.625-mm section thickness. Because of its capacity for thin-section scanning and multiplanar reformation, 64-channel multidetector CT cholangiography can clearly demonstrate the biliary anatomy, a variety of anatomic variants, and the extent of disease--information that is indispensable for successful hepatobiliary surgery."

CD009323,0,21490865,0,True carcinosarcoma of the esophagus: report of a case.,"Carcinosarcoma of the esophagus is a malignant neoplasm involving both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components. We report a patient with true esophageal carcinosarcoma who underwent laparoscopy-assisted surgery. An upper gastrointestinal barium study revealed a lobulated intraluminal filling defect in the lower intrathoracic esophagus. The patient underwent esophagectomy and regional lymphadenectomy with gastric tube reconstruction by laparoscopy-assisted surgery and thoracotomy. The esophageal hiatus was entered and the mediastinal esophagus was dissected using a laparoscopic approach. Microscopically, the tumor comprised poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and spindle-shaped cells resembling leiomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemically, spindle-shaped sarcomatous cells displayed strongly positive reaction to vimentin and negative reaction to cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and CD68. No transitional zone was seen between sarcomatous and carcinomatous elements. The patient was finally diagnosed with true esophageal carcinosarcoma. Laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy seems to be a rational and safe procedure for lower esophageal neoplasms, even for patients with impaired respiratory function."

Therefore, local excision or more extended surgery is performed under open laparotomy. In this paper, we present a laparoscopic resection of Brunner's gland hyperplasia of the duodenum which demonstrated rapid interval size change. A 73-year-old male with a histologically unproven submucosal tumor underwent endoscopy-assisted laparoscopic resection of the tumor and intracorporeal suturing of the defect. Simultaneous duodenoscopy and laparoscopy were performed to identify the line of resection. A duodenotomy was performed and the tumor was excised after everting the tumor toward the abdominal cavity. The defect was handsewn with the greater curvature side rolled caudally with an exteriorized stay suture. Postoperative pain was minimal and the patient quickly returned to normal activity. Our new technique provides a minimal invasive treatment for tumors of the duodenum."

Presence of caput pancreatis enlargement, infiltration and limited fluid accumulation, gall bladder enlargement and increase in bilirubin level was evaluated. Evidence of biliary hypertension was evaluated according to bile amount flowing out of the cholecystostoma. Findings allowed to draw the following conclusions. Increase in conjugated bilirubin, dilatation of bile ducts, gall bladder enlargement over 120 mm lengthwise are the indications to cholecystostoma surgery at acute necrotic pancreatitis. Gall bladder drainage in other cases is not reasonable. Cholecystostoma surgery should be carried out at the latest 3 days from the moment of admission to hospital preferably by laparoscopic method. Presence of initial hypotension is the contra-indication to gall bladder drainage even in case of total normalization of hemodynamics."

A few more than 100 of these cases have been published. Epidemiological studies concerning small bowel carcinoma showed consumption of sugar and carbohydrates as pathogenetic factors, other conditions like ileostoma, ileumconduit, Crohn's disease and coeliac disease have been identified to some extent. An adenoma-carcinoma sequence as in large intestine carcinoma has been discussed. Immunohistochemical and oncogenetic findings failed to demonstrate any result of practical clinical value. Diagnosis of early stages of adenocarcinoma of the small intestine is very difficult and thus might be impossible to differentiate from exacerbation or progressive stenosis of preexisting Crohn's disease. If non-invasive diagnostic measures (ultrasound, small bowel enema, CT-scan, intestinoscopy, radiography, NMR-Sellink, capsule-endoscopy) fail to clear the situation a diagnostic laparoscopy or even laparotomy should not be delayed. This constitutes the only chance to discover early stages which can possibly be cured in accordance with oncosurgical principles.

We present two patients with SBA in CD and review the literature with regards to CD-related SBA. A 45-year-old male with a 17-year history of ileal CD presented with obstructive symptoms but no radiographic evidence of a mass. After laparoscopic ileocolectomy and repair of incidental ileosigmoid fistula, pathology showed a T3N0 adenocarcinoma within the ileal CD. Two years after his resection he was without evidence of disease. A 59-year-old male with a 15-year history of CD presented with an acute exacerbation. Small bowel follow through demonstrated a long ileal stricture for which he underwent an ileocolic resection. Postoperative pathology confirmed a T3N1 CD-related SBA. He died from metastatic cancer 3 months later. Review of the literature identified 154 cases of SBA complicating CD with several distinguishing features from de novo SBA. Patients with SBA and CD are, as a group, younger and more likely to be male.

CD009323,0,18084953,0,Surgical palliation of advanced pancreatic cancer.,"In about 80% of patients with pancreatic cancer surgical resection is not feasible at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, palliative treatment plays a key role in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The defined goals of palliative treatment are: reduction of symptoms, reduction of in-hospital stays, and an adequate control of pain. In patients with nonresectable pancreatic carcinoma the leading goal of palliative strategies should be the control of biliary and duodenal obstructions such as jaundice-associated pruritus or sustained nausea and vomiting due to gastric outlet obstruction. Although the role of endoscopy for palliation has been increasing, operative palliation is still indicated in selected cases. Obstructive jaundice is found in approximately 70% of patients suffering from carcinoma of the pancreatic head at diagnosis and has to be eliminated to avoid progressive liver dysfunction and liver failure. In up to 50% of patients with pancreatic cancer, clinical symptoms such as nausea and vomiting occur. For the treatment of malignant biliary obstructions in patients with pancreatic carcinoma, endoscopic biliary drainage is the option of first choice. In case of persistent stent-problems such as occlusion or recurrent cholangitis, a hepaticojejunostomy should be considered. The role of a prophylactic gastroenterostomy is still under discussion. In patients with combined biliary and gastric obstruction a combined bypass should be performed to avoid a second operation. The significance of laparoscopic biliary bypass is not yet clear. A surgical, minimally invasive approach for treating bile duct obstruction is not the standard nowadays. The role of surgical pain relief is mostly negligible today. Computed tomography (CT)- or EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis has replaced surgical intervention today. The significance of palliative resections is currently a controversial topic. However, beyond controlled randomized studies, a palliative pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma cannot be recommended at this time."
CD009323,0,18084944,0,Surgical techniques for resectable pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive cancer with a rising incidence in most European countries. Due to both the aggressive biology of the disease and the late diagnosis in many cases, pancreatic duct carcinoma is still a disease with a poor prognosis. Today, surgical resection of localized tumor remains the only potentially curative option available for these patients. Advances in surgical techniques and perioperative care has improved significantly in the last 20 years, causing an extension of indications for surgical intervention. However, despite new diagnostic techniques, the surgical exploration still plays the key role for the finally assessment of resectability. For evaluation of local resectability, laparoscopy alone cannot generally be recommended today and explorative laparotomy is required. Contraindications for pancreatic resection are liver metastasis, peritoneal metastasis, and tumor infiltration of visceral arteries. The surgical management of pancreatic cancer consists of two phases: first, assessment of tumor resectability and second, if resectability is given, the pancreaticoduodenectomy with consecutive reconstruction. Standard surgical strategies are the classic pancreaticoduodenectomy including a distal gastrectomy and the pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) preserving antral and pyloric function, respectively. Both surgical procedures are equally effective for the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma. Delicate lymphadenectomy during pancreaticoduodenectomy is important for radical oncological enforcement. An extended lymphadenectomy showed no benefit in several trials. Despite the encouraging advances in surgical treatment, actuarial 5-year survival rates after pancreatic resection are only at about 20%."

The fistula was closed laparoscopically, and the patient underwent partial gastrectomy and gastric wall repair, followed by successful chemotherapy. This is also the first reported case in published literature where closure of gastrosplenic fistula and partial gastrectomy was carried out laparoscopically. We recommend that extensive open surgical procedures including total gastrectomy, splenectomy, and pancreatectomy may be avoided in the management of gastrosplenic fistula, and the patient could be managed by less radical, simple laparoscopic fistulectomy, with partial gastric resection. If the fistula is caused by a malignant process, the surgical repair should be followed by definitive treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy."

However, preoperative imaging methods may be unsatisfactory for the correct diagnosis. As a result, incomplete resections may be performed. Intraoperative cholangiography should be performed in suspected cases to prevent inadvertent injury to the biliary system.

CD009323,0,18049395,0,Needlescopic Cholecystectomy Versus Needlescope-assisted Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy.,"This clinical study was performed to compare the feasibility, safety, and best use of the needlescope and needlescopic instruments. Needlescopic cholecystectomy (NC) or needlescope-assisted cholecystectomy (NAC) was performed in 40 cases of gallbladder (GB) stone or polyp. There were 12 men and 28 women, with a mean age of 51.8 years (range, 27 to 79 y). The port sites consisted of three 2-mm ports at the right upper quadrant and one 12-mm port at the umbilicus. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of the needlescope, the time taken to perform each operative step was compared for NC and NAC. Operation time was divided into: (1) skin incision to insertion of the 4 ports; (2) insertion of the 4 ports to cannulation into the cystic duct; (3) time of intraoperative cholangiography (IOC); (4) skin incision to cutting of the cystic duct without IOC; (5) cutting the cystic duct to dissection of the GB; (6) dissection of the GB to removal of the GB; (7) removal of the GB to skin closure; and (8) total operation time. IOC was performed successfully in 10 cases of NC and 10 cases of NAC. Respective mean times of the 8 steps were 5.4 versus 5.3 minutes, 34.2 versus 32.2 minutes, 20.1 versus 18.4 minutes, 33.9 versus 31.3 minutes, 19.6 versus 18.9 minutes, 3.1 versus 2.9 minutes, 10.0 versus 10.2 minutes and 82.5 versus 77.8 minutes for NC versus NAC, respectively.

CD009323,0,18043987,0,Surrogate markers of resectability in patients undergoing exploration of potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.,"Despite extensive preoperative staging, a significant number of pancreatic cancers are unresectable at surgical exploration. Patients undergoing pancreatic exploration with a view to resection were studied and comparisons are then made between those undergoing resection and a bypass procedure to identify surrogate markers of unresectability. One hundred thirteen consecutive patients underwent pancreatic exploration for head-of-pancreas (HOP) adenocarcinoma with curative intent. Fifty-five underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and 58 underwent a bypass procedure. Student's t test, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) and logistic regression were used to compare the predictive value of preoperative patient variables collected retrospectively. The bypass group had a significantly higher median CA19.9 than the resection group (P = 0.003). Platelet count and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were also significantly different (P = 0.013 and P = 0.026, respectively). ROC analysis indicated that age < or =65, platelet count >297 x 10(9)/l, CA19.9 < or =473 Ku/l, and CA19.9-bilirubin ratio were predictive variables for resectable disease. NLR and CA19.9-bilirubin ratio had specificity values of 92.9 and 97.0%, respectively. From logistic regression, a raised CA19.9 was found to be an independent risk factor for unresectable disease (P = 0.031). A significant proportion of patients with HOP adenocarcinoma are understaged preoperatively. Preoperative serology including platelet count, NLR, CA19.9, and CA19.9-bilirubin ratio may be used as additional discriminators of resectability particularly for high-risk patients."
CD009323,0,18043848,0,Management of pyogenic liver abscesses - percutaneous or open drainage?,"This pictorial essay aims to review the literature on the management of pyogenic liver abscess, focusing on the choice of drainage. Articles on the treatment of pyogenic liver abscess, accessed through a MEDLINE search using PubMed, were reviewed. A case series of the authors' experience with clinicopathological correlation is presented to highlight the indication and outcome of each modality of drainage. Intravenous antibiotic is the first line, and mainstay, of treatment. Drainage is necessary for large abscesses, equal to or larger than 5 cm in size, to facilitate resolution. While percutaneous drainage is appropriate as first-line surgical treatment in most cases, open surgical drainage is prudent in cases of rupture, multiloculation, associated biliary or intra-abdominal pathology. Percutaneous drainage may help to optimise clinical condition prior to surgery. Laparoscopic drainage is a feasible surgical option with promising results in the future. Liver resection is reserved for concomitant localised intrahepatic disease and tumour, after control of sepsis. The final verdict on the outcome of percutaneous versus open surgical drainage of pyogenic liver abscesses requires further studies in a controlled trial setting. Nevertheless, in current good clinical practices, the choice of therapy needs to be individualised according to patient's clinical status and abscess factors. They are complementary in the management of liver abscesses."

CD009323,0,18035536,0,Laparoscopic rectal resection with intraoperative radiotherapy in locally advanced cancer: preliminary results.,"Carcinoma of the rectum is a common malignancy, especially in developed countries. The main stay of the therapy for rectal cancer is radical surgery. Total mesorectal excision has emerged as the surgical technique that can substantially reduce local recurrences. The laparoscopic approach does not seem to entail any oncologic disadvantages. Radiotherapy (RT) alone is capable of eradicating some localized rectal tumors while its effect on larger tumors is limited by normal tissue tolerance, tumor sensitivity and microscopic spread beyond the primary site. Preoperative chemoradiation has potential advantages. The rationale for combining cytotoxic agents and RT is based on the ability of some drugs to act as an enhancer of RT. Preoperative chemoradiation can potentially downstage tumors to facilitate surgery, reduce the risk of tumor seeding, problems with hypoxia which is increased postoperatively, allowing more optimal tumor cell kill for equivalent doses compared to postoperative radiotherapy. The addition of radiation to surgery has been successfully used in many disease sites. In the intraoperative radiotherapy (IOERT), a high dose to the area of highest risk for tumor cell persistence is delivered while dose-limiting structures such as small bowel, bladder, or ureters can be mechanically excluded. Our preliminary experience shows that laparoscopic rectal resection with IOERT is not only feasible, but associates oncologic radical treatment with important advantages of laparoscopic approach."

We present three cases that illustrate the difficulty of diagnosing this clinical entity. We emphasize the use of minimally invasive techniques such as computed tomography and laparoscopic surgery in the complicated management of these patients. We believe that the use of these techniques could avoid the need for other more aggressive procedures and allow the application of early definitive surgical treatment with the advantages of laparoscopic surgery."
CD009323,0,18018350,0,[The Pringle maneuver in laparoscopic hepatic surgery: is it useful? Analysis of a series of 38 cases].,"The Pringle maneuver is the most feasible method to control bleeding in hepatic resections in both open and laparoscopic approach. However its role in the mini-invasive surgery is still questionable. The aim of this study is to analyze our experience and to compare it to the literature data. This is a retrospective cohort study that includes all hepatic laparoscopic resections performed in our department between 1998-2007 and excludes all exploratory laparoscopies and all cases in which conversion to open procedure was imposed after the lesion assessment and in the absence on any intraoperative event. 38 hepatic laparoscopic resections were performed for both benign lesions (20 out of which 13 hemangiomas, 2 focal nodular hyperplasia, 1 liver cell adenoma, 2 hydatic cysts, 2 inflammatory lesions) and malignant lesions (18 out of which 8 metastases, 9 hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 cholangiocarcinoma). The tumor diameter ranged between 2 and 10 cm. There were 2 conversions to open procedures due to bleeding from hepatic veins collaterals. Pringle maneuver was never used. Pringle maneuver did not prove to be useful in our series because, on one hand, we performed only limited laparoscopic hepatic resections and, on the other hand, intraoperative bleeding was mainly due to lesions of the hepatic veins collaterals which cannot be influenced by clamping the hepatic pedicle. Even if there is no consensus, major laparoscopic hepatic resections may benefit from Pringle maneuver."

CD009323,0,17984850,0,Robotic distal pancreatectomy and nephrectomy for living donor pancreas-kidney transplantation.,"Living organ donation is of increasing importance to satisfy the demand of good quality organs for patients remaining for extended periods on the waiting list. While the benefit for the recipient is undeniable, the organ procurement represents an important burden to live donors in terms of invasiveness and long-term consequences. The latter can be minimized with careful donor selection. With the avenue of minimally invasive surgery, and more recently the availability of robotic technology, the surgical trauma can be reduced, the safety increased, and the recovery accelerated. In this case report, we present the first reported combined robotic distal pancreatectomy and left nephrectomy from a live donor. The surgery was performed using the Da Vinci robotic system with four small trocar incisions, and a short infraumbilical midline incision for hand-assistance and extraction of the organ. The donor operation lasted 5 hr and blood loss was only 100 mL. Both donor and recipient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and present with normal endocrine and renal function 3 mo after surgery. In experienced hands, advanced surgical procedures such as combined distal pancreatectomy and left nephrectomy can be safely performed in living donors with minimally invasive robotic surgery, dramatically reduced surgical trauma, and impressive postoperative recovery. The availability of minimally invasive robotic surgery may further increase the willingness for live organ donation from suitable donors."

Currently, negative effects of alcalic biliary reflux on the esophageal mucosa have been demonstrated. It may result in serious complications of the disorder, including esophageal strictures, ulcerations, bleeding and, in particular, development of a Barrett's esophagus premalignancy which may, potentialy, result in adenocarcinoma. During 2004-2005, a total of 148 subjects were operated in the Ist Surgical Clinic for gastroesophageal reflux disorders. Most of the subjects underwent antireflux procedures, laparoscopic Rossetti modifications of fundoplication. The group of patients suffering from symptomatic biliary refluxes, confirmed on endoscopy, included 14 subjects. The patients were indicated for indirect antireflux procedures, gastric resections with gastrojejunoanastomosis using a Roux loop. After the procedure, all patients recovered from the symptoms of the disorder, which corresponded with favourable control findings on endoscopy. In patients with symptomatic biliary reflux, indirect antireflux procedures are prefered, to prevent development of esophageal reflux disorder complications."

The complication was recognized during the operation in 11 cases. Reoperation was necessary in five cases (0.4%), and conservative management was applied in three cases. Although infrequent, major complications may occur during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Immediate recognition and management is critical and may lead to a safe outcome."

CD009323,0,17966779,0,Laparoscopic resection of duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma. A case report.,"Paraganglioma is an exceedingly rare tumour of the duodenum that arises in close proximity to the ampulla of Vater. To date a total of 133 cases of duodenal paraganglioma have been reported in the literature; of these, 27 (20%) were histologically gangliocytic paragangliomas. This neoplasm generally behaves in a benign fashion, although instances of recurrence and/or lymph node metastasis have been described. The treatment consists in endoscopic polypectomy or surgical resection in relation to the histological features and the macroscopic extent of the neoplasm. We present a case of a benign duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma treated by a laparo-endoscopic approach. We report a case of gangliocytic paraganglioma in a 75-year-old woman admitted to the General Surgery Division of Aosta Regional Hospital (Aosta-Italy), complaining of melaena and anaemia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy followed by enteroscopy with a video-capsula, revealed a pedunculated neoplasm in the second portion of the duodenum, with ulceration of the overlying mucosa. Multiple biopsies were performed during the endoscopic examination and showed the cellular pattern of benign paraganglioma. After stabilisation of the patient's clinical status, we performed a resection of the neoplasm via a laparoscopic transduodenal approach and a concomitant intraoperative duodenoscopy. The histological features showed a gangliocytic paraganglioma without a malignant cell pattern. The size of the neoplasm was 4 cm. The resection margins were free of neoplastic infiltration. The postoperative stay was 9 days and there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The patient is currently in good health without any tumour recurrence. Transduodenal laparoscopic resection with intraoperative duodenoscopy is a valuable treatment for benign gangliocytic paraganglioma of the duodenum which is unresectable by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. This approach affords the advantages of the minimally invasive technique and fulfils the surgical tenets of the open transduodenal approach, if en bloc resection of the neoplasm with the adjacent duodenal wall is performed."
CD009323,0,17964753,0,Gallbladder carcinoma.,"Although it is the most common cancer of the biliary tree, gallbladder carcinoma remains an uncommon disease. As a result, many clinicians rarely encounter it and there is uncertainty regarding proper management. Resection is the most effective and only potentially curative treatment. Early stage tumors are often curable with a proper resection; however, many patients present late in the course of the disease when surgical intervention is no longer effective. While other treatment modalities are used in patients with advanced disease, there is limited data on efficacy. In many cases, the diagnosis is made after a cholecystectomy has been performed and an incidental tumor is identified in the specimen. In such cases, reoperation and definitive resection is appropriate and effective for patients with invasive lesions."
CD009323,0,17962132,0,Duodenopleural fistula formation after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a treatment option in the management of unresectable or recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It can be performed either through laparotomy or in a minimally invasive manner by percutaneous, laparoscopic or thoracoscopic routes. Percutaneous RFA is associated with reduced surgical trauma and thus can be performed in patients with significant comorbidities. The procedure can be repeated after short intervals for sequential ablation of multiple liver lesions. However, the associated risks should not be underestimated. This is the first report of a rare complication of duodeno-pleural fistula after percutaneous RFA of a recurrent subcapsular HCC. The risk of bowel perforation during the ablation of subcapsular HCC requires special attention, since only the position of the tip of the electrode, but not the zone of ablation, can be assessed accurately by imaging during the procedure. Our case demonstrated that there was leakage of bowel content from the duodenal injury site into the pleural cavity through the RFA track. Subsequent uncontrolled infection resulted in empyema thoracis and led to the death of the patient."
CD009323,0,17824969,0,Adhesion-related small bowel obstruction.,"Postoperative adhesions are the commonest cause of small bowel obstruction (SBO), a frequent surgical emergency. Adhesion obstruction is potentially lethal and a crucial aspect in management is to differentiate whether there is actual, or impending, small bowel ischaemia and therefore a need for emergency surgery. There are no completely accurate imaging or haematological techniques to exclude the requirement for surgery. Modern computerized tomography (CT) has been a significant advance in noninvasive assessment of SBO and may demonstrate the cause of the obstruction and suggest the presence of bowel ischaemia. It is important to note that adhesions may not be the cause of SBO in a patient who has had abdominal surgery. Recurrent cancer, an obstructive colon lesion in the presence of an incompetent ileocaecal valve, an occult hernia, small bowel arterial or venous ischaemia, amongst others may be the cause and CT may elucidate some of these causes and help plan management. Increasing utilization of laparoscopic surgery may reduce the extent and incidence of adhesions and laparoscopic adhesiolysis, in experienced hands, may be successful in managing acute obstruction or alternatively as a planned procedure when the obstruction has resolved. Adhesive SBO remains a common surgical emergency and there is no substitute for repeated examination by a surgeon, capable of performing a laparotomy, in the optimal management of these complex patients."
CD009323,0,17958895,0,Rapid intraoperative insulin assay: a novel method to differentiate insulinoma from nesidioblastosis in the pediatric patient.,"Hyperinsulinism is the most common cause of recurrent and persistent hypoglycemia in infancy and childhood. Causes can include nesidioblastosis, pancreatic islet cell tumors such as insulinoma, and associations with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. Although new, improved imaging techniques have allowed for more precise preoperative localization of insulinomas, the differentiation of nesidioblastosis and insulinoma, particularly in children, can be challenging. To improve intraoperative localization and confirmation of successful resection of insulinoma, a novel hormonal assay, the rapid intraoperative insulin assay, is reported for the first time in a pediatric patient. This intraoperative radioimmunoassay for insulin yields results within several minutes and confirms complete resection of insulinoma."

CD009323,0,17955727,0,Gastric heterotopia together with squamous metaplasia in the gallbladder.,"Heterotopic gastric mucosa in the gallbladder is extremely unusual. In this study, we aimed to report a case of gastric heterotopia together with squamous metaplasia in the gallbladder of a 47-year-old female patient who experienced an intensive abdominal pain. He was admitted to the hospital for clinical treatment without any improvement. Ultrasonography showed a stone located in the gallbladder neck and dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts, both hepatic ducts and common hepatic duct. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. In the microscopical examination, the epithelium of the gallbladder revealed an unspecified chronic cholecystitis. Besides, at the level of the gallbladder body, a heterotopic gastric mucosa contain chief, parietal and mucosal cells with cystic glands and squamous metaplasia was found. Actually the patient is in long-time follow-up, asymptomatic. We also review 96 other reports of HGM in the gallbladder in the international medical literature from 1934. As heterotopic tissue may promote carcinogenesis of the gallbladder, close attention should be paid to any occurrence of such lesions in this anatomical region. It appears that laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be unavoidable for patients affected by heterotopic gastric mucosa at the present time and care must be taken when a diagnosis is made based on intraoperative frozen sections."
CD009323,0,17955309,0,"The challenges of resident training in complex hepatic, pancreatic, and biliary procedures.","Operations on the liver and pancreas have fallen within the domain of the general surgeon and have been part of general surgery training. The more complex procedures involving these organs are limited in number in most general surgery residencies and do not afford an opportunity for vast experience. Moreover, fellowship programs in hepato-bilio-pancreatic (HPB) surgery and the development of laparoscopic techniques may have further limited the familiarity of general surgery residents with these operations. To determine the experience accrued by finishing general surgery residents, we accessed, through the Residency Review Committee of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the Resident Case Log System used by general surgery residents throughout their training to document operative cases. The number of operations on the gallbladder, bile ducts, pancreas, and liver was examined over the past 16 years (there were missing data for 3 years). Reference years 1995 and 2005 were compared to detect trends. Experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy has steadily increased and averaged more than 100 cases in 2006. Experience in liver resection, distal pancreatectomy, and partial (Whipple) pancreatectomy has statistically improved from 1995 to 2005, but the numbers of cases are low, generally less than five per finishing resident. Experience in open common bile duct and choledocho-enteric anastomoses has statistically declined from 1995 to 2005, averaging less than four cases per finishing resident. The mode (most frequently performed number) for liver and pancreas resections was either 0 or 1. It is doubtful this experience in HPB surgery engenders confidence in many finishing residents. Attention should be focused on augmenting training in HPB surgery for general surgery residents perhaps through a combination of programmatic initiatives, ex vivo experiences, and minifellowships. Institutional initiatives might consist of defined HPB services with appropriate expertise, infrastructure, process, and outcome measures in which a resident-oriented, competency-based curriculum could be developed."

We describe here a rare case of cystic lymphangioma of the gallbladder, which was unusual in that the patient presented with biliary pain and an abnormal liver test. Ultrasonography and computed tomography of the abdomen showed a multi-septated cystic mass in the gallbladder fossa and an adjacent compressed gallbladder. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed there was no communication between the bile tract and the lesion, and there were no other abnormal findings with the exception of a laterally compressed gallbladder. After performing endoscopic sphincterotomy, a small amount of sludge was released from the bile duct. The histological findings were consistent with a cystic lymphangioma originating from the subserosal layer of the gallbladder. This unusual clinical presentation of a gallbladder cystic lymphangioma was attributed to biliary sludge, and this was induced by gallbladder dysfunction that was possibly from compression of the gallbladder due to the mass."

CD009323,0,17933666,0,The laparoscopic approach toward hyperinsulinism in children.,"Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH) in children requiring surgery is rare. Early HH can be the result of focal or diffuse pancreatic pathology. A number of genetic abnormalities in early HH have been identified, but in the majority of patients no abnormality is found. The sporadic focal and diffuse forms as well the autosomal recessive form are particularly therapy-resistant and demand for early surgery. Preoperative discrimination between focal and diffuse disease in early HH is difficult. 18 F DOPA PET in combination with CT is promising as is laparoscopic exploration of the pancreas. Frozen section biopsy analysis has not been uniformly beneficial. If macroscopically no focal lesion is found, limited laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy provides tissue for definitive pathologic examination. Subsequent near total laparoscopic spleen-saving pancreatectomy surgery is not particularly difficult. Later HH may occur in the context of the MEN-1 syndrome and is then multifocal in nature. In MEN-1 patients, a distal spleen-saving pancreatectomy with enucleation of lesions in the head seems justified. Insulin-producing lesions in non-MEN-1 patients should be enucleated. There should always be a suspicion of malignancy. Also, in older children, surgery for hyperinsulinism should be performed laparoscopically."

A 10-year-old girl visited our hospital because of right epigastric pain and fever. Cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis were diagnosed by ultrasound examination. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed no pancreaticobiliary maljunction but confirmed a dilated, tortuous cystic duct anomalously draining into the right hepatic duct. Because cholangitis and obstructive jaundice progressed after admission, emergent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed, and a common bile duct stone was removed endoscopically. It was a bilirubin stone. At a later date, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed for cholelithiasis. Preoperative 3-dimensional computed tomography and intraoperative cholangiography enabled us to treat the cystic duct safely."

Occasionally they can be seen in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, in the pre-sternal and pericardial areas, but those located under the diaphragm are extremely rare. We report a 24 year-old female who consulted for abdominal pain. An abdominal ultrasound disclosed a retroperitoneal cystic lesion, that was confirmed with a CAT scan.

CD009323,0,17909923,0,Laparoscopic vs. open resection of noninvasive intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasms.,"Required resection margins for noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are a controversial issue. Over a 10-year period we have resected IPMNs from the entire pancreatic gland with minimally invasive techniques and compared our survival and complication rates with open controls to see if any difference in resection margins and outcomes could be observed. Data were collected retrospectively, including our first cases of advanced laparoscopic resections. Five-year Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated and statistical analysis was performed using the log rank and Student's T test for continuous variables. Chi square and Fisher's exact tests were used for analyzing categorical variables. From March 1997 to February 2006, we operated on 22 patients with noninvasive IPMNs, of which 9 (41%) were operated on laparoscopically and 13 (59%) using open techniques. Three patients underwent laparoscopic duodenopancreatectomy, compared to five in the open group. All resection margins were negative, but two patients required total pancreatectomy, both of which were performed laparoscopically. One of these was converted to open (11%) because of difficulty in reconstructing the biliary anastomosis. The overall complication rates were 56% for the laparoscopic group and 85% for the open group. Twenty-two percent of the laparoscopic group required reoperation and 11% required percutaneous drainage, compared to 15 and 23% in the open group, respectively. All patients are alive after a mean of 20 months (range = 2-43) in the laparoscopic group and 37 months (range = 1-121) in the open one (p > 0.05). Laparoscopic resection of noninvasive IPMNs of the entire pancreatic gland has similar complication and survival rates as open procedures. As a result, the laparoscopic approach is appropriate for noninvasive IPMNs of the entire pancreatic gland; however, larger cohorts are needed to see if any approach has superior outcomes. Because of these favorable results, studies are currently underway to see if the minimally invasive approach is also appropriate for invasive IPMNs."
CD009323,0,17907989,0,Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy: description of an original posterior approach.,"We are describing in this paper the original and innovative technique we used to perform a spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. With the patient positioned on her right lateral side, we inserted four laparoscopic ports in the left subcostal region to enable an upper view on the spleen and its rear attachments. With this approach, we opened and dissected this plan located between the left kidney and the rear aspect of the spleen and of the pancreas. These structures, once liberated naturally, felt ""en-bloc"" out of the way because of the patient's lateral positioning and the gravity, exposing the operative field without any artificial retraction. Beyond this greater exposure, this new approach offers many other advantages, such as the easiness to be performed by only two operators and the preservation of the anterior abdominal cavity, the great omentum, the splenic vessels, and the short gastric vessels left untouched."

These injuries are mainly attributable to a misunderstanding of the biliary tract anatomy owing to severe cholecystitis, large impacted stones, and anatomic variations. In this paper, we report on the successful treatment of a 59-year-old male patient with cholecystolithiasis accompanied with extremely unusual biliary junction, in which the cystic duct drained into the left hepatic duct while using the laparoscopic fundus-first-cholecystectomy approach (i.e., the doom down technique) without any serious intraoperative complications.

This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and long-term outcome of the laparoscopic approach in patients with benign, premalignant, and overt malignant lesions of the pancreas. This study, currently, is the largest single center experience worldwide. One hundred twenty-three consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic pancreatic surgery from April 1998 to April 2007, 20 patients with cysts or pseudocysts for acute and chronic pancreatitis, laparoscopic pancreatic drainage was performed, and were excluded from the analysis. The 103 patients were divided based on preoperative diagnosis: group I, inflammatory tumors for chronic pancreatitis (eight patients); group II, cystic pancreatic neoplasms (29 patients); group III, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (10 patients); group IV, neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors (NETs) (43 patients); and group V ductal adenocarcinoma (13 patients). The median tumor size was 5.3 cm. Pathologic data include R(0) or R(1) resection (transection margins on the specimen were inked). Perioperative data, postoperative complications, and resection modalities were compared using statistical analysis. Long-term outcomes were analysed by tumor recurrence and patient survival. The overall conversion rate was 7%. Laparoscopic distal pancreatic resection was performed in 82 patients (79.6%). Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (Lap SPDP) was performed in 52 patients (63.7%), but with splenic vessels preservation in 22% and without splenic vessels preservation in 41.5%. Laparoscopic en-bloc splenopancreatectomy (Lap SxDP) was performed in 30 patients (36.6%) and laparoscopic enucleation (Lap En) in 20 patients (19.4%). There was no mortality. The overall complication rate was 25.2, 16.7, and 40% after Lap SPDP, Lap SxDP, and Lap En, respectively. The overall morbidity rate was significantly higher (p>0.05) in the group of Lap SPDP without splenic vessels preservation comparing with Lap SPDP with splenic vessels preservation because of the occurrence of splenic complications (20.6%). The overall pancreatic fistulas was 7.7, 10, and 35% after Lap SPDP, Lap SxDP, and Lap En, respectively; the severity of fistula was significantly higher in the Lap En group (p>0.05). The mean hospital stay was within 1 week in all groups, except in the group of ductal adenocarcinoma, which is 8 days. In this series, 27 patients (26.2%) had malignant disease.

CD009323,0,17879698,0,Metastatic malignant melanoma of the gallbladder presenting as biliary colic: a case report and review of literature.,"Malignant melanoma (MM) is the most common cancer to metastasize to the gastrointestinal tract. Autopsy reports estimate that up to 15 per cent of these patients also have gallbladder metastases, and MM accounts for up to 60 per cent of metastatic lesions to the gallbladder. However, despite its prevalence, MM to the gallbladder is reported only sparingly in the literature. This discordance may be explained by the fact that these lesions are seldom symptomatic. Abdominal ultrasound remains the modality of choice in studying gallbladder pathology and has the ability to define metastatic lesions. The effect of screening for gallbladder metastases on improving survival is not well defined, and thus its role remains controversial. Cholecystectomy for melanoma metastases to the gallbladder seems to be mostly palliative, although there have been isolated reports of excellent long-term survival outcomes. The role for immunotherapy and chemotherapy in this population is not well defined, and overall prognosis is poor. Recent reports have advocated laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the treatment of choice, though there remains a concern for peritoneal port site seeding. We present the case of a 48-year-old man with MM metastatic to the gallbladder and a brief review of the literature."

CD009323,0,17876869,0,Surgical management of polycystic liver disease.,"Adult polycystic liver disease (PCLD) is an autosomal dominant condition commonly associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However in the last decade, it has been recognized that there is a distinct form of autosomal dominant PCLD that arises without concomitant ADPKD. Early knowledge of the pathogenesis was gained from the study of hepatic cysts in patients with ADPKD. Bile duct overgrowth after embryogenesis results in cystic hepatic dilatations that are known as biliary microhamartomas or von Meyenburg complexes. Further dilatation arises from cellular proliferation and fluid secretion into these cysts. There is a variable, broad spectrum of manifestations of PCLD. Although PCLD is most often asymptomatic, massive hepatomegaly can lead to disabling symptoms of abdominal pain, early satiety, persistent nausea, dyspnea, ascites, biliary obstruction, and lower body edema. Complications of PCLD include cyst rupture and cyst infection. Also, there are associated medical problems, especially intracranial aneurysms and valvular heart disease, which clinicians need to be aware of and evaluate in patients with PCLD. In asymptomatic patients, no treatment is indicated for PCLD. In the symptomatic patient, surgical therapy is the mainstay of treatment tailored to the extent of disease for each patient. Management options include cyst aspiration and sclerosis, open or laparoscopic fenestration, liver resection with fenestration, and liver transplantation. The surgical literature discussing treatment of PCLD, including techniques, outcomes, and complication rates, are summarized in this review."

Experimental work focuses on factors that reduce the variability of the ablation zone. The Pringle-maneuver plays a key role in this question from a surgeon's perspective. Large single center studies and a meta-analysis show a sharp rise in the rate of local recurrences for tumors larger 3 cm. An open surgical approach is significantly correlated to a low local recurrence rate. Bile duct lesions and intrahepatic abscesses are the most frequent complications. Intraductal bile duct cooling can prevent these complications. Three prospective randomized trials support the use of RFA for small hepatocellular carcinoma. The use of RFA in patients with multiple colorectal metastases is supported by single center studies showing a 3 year survival of > 35%. The favourable cost / benefit ratio will make RFA a part of future multimodal cancer therapy concepts.

At the other extreme is the Japanese aggressivism with high mortality but very few actual long-term survivors. The Indian surgeons have adopted a Buddhist ""middle path""--aggressive surgical approach for ""less advanced"" GBC and non-surgical palliative approach for ""more advanced"" GBC. We rely heavily on staging laparoscopy to detect metastatic deposits on liver, peritoneum and omentum, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) to detect duodenal infiltration which indicates unresectability as we do not perform pancreatico-duodenectomy for GBC. Our favoured procedure is extended cholecystectomy (EC) which includes a 2 cm nonanatomical wedge of liver in the GB bed and the lymph nodes in hepatoduodenal ligament, behind the duodenum and head of pancreas and along the hepatic artery to the right of celiac axis. EC can achieve R0 resection in patients with T1-T2 and T3 (fundus/body--hepatic bed type) disease. For T3 (neck--hepatic hilum type) and T4 disease major hepatic resection is required. In selected patients with nodally advanced GBC, a non-curative simple cholecystectomy with post-operative chemoradiotherapy may improve survival.

Guidance by an imaging technique is necessary: ultrasound, CT or magnetic resonance imaging. The principal hepatic indications are hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic metastases smaller than <5 cm. There is no associated mortality and only slight morbidity, due principally to hemorrhage, infection or stenosis of the bile ducts. Results show a 5-year survival rate of 40% for hepatocellular carcinoma and 22% for metastases."
CD009323,0,19789667,0,Left-sided gall bladder: Report of two cases.,Left-sided gall bladder without situs inversus viscerum is a rare albeit recognized clinical entity. We report our experience of two cases of left-sided gall bladder in two women aged 36 and 48 who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for chronic calculous cholecystitis. Left-sided gall bladder may provide an unusual surprise to the surgeons during laparoscopy as routine pre-operative studies may not always detect the anomaly. Awareness of the unpredictable confluence of the cystic duct into the common bile duct (CBD) and selective use of intraoperative cholangiography aid in the safe laparoscopic management of this unusual entity.

CD009323,0,17593471,0,"Laparoscopic pancreatic resection: the past, present, and future.","Since the early 1990s, laparoscopic techniques have been applied to a growing number of pancreatic surgeries. Laparoscopic pancreatic resections have been performed in patients with a variety of diseases including chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic trauma, congenital hyperinsulinism, and neoplasms of the pancreas; e.g., insulinoma, mucinous cystic neoplasm, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, etc. Laparoscopic pancreatic resections with an en bloc lymph node dissection have also been performed for invasive carcinomas. The long-term results after laparoscopic resections for invasive pancreatic cancer, however, are still not well defined. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies with or without spleen preservation may benefit patients with reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, a quicker recovery to normal activity, and better cosmetic appearances based on retrospective analyses of collective series and case reports. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to validate these benefits. In contrast, laparoscopic proximal pancreatectomies with or without duodenum preservation remain controversial. Although a laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy and laparoscopic duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection are technically feasible, laparoscopic reconstruction after proximal pancreatectomies is not yet generally practicable but limited to personal experiences by highly skilled endoscopic surgeons. To justify the performance of laparoscopic proximal pancreatectomies, it is mandatory to demonstrate the potential clinical benefits and safety of these complicated procedures."

The critical view technique was performed with anterolateral infundibular retraction, and the infundibulum and body were dissected along the peritoneal reflection on both sides of the gallbladder. The cystic duct and infundibulum were funnel shaped and spiraled from lateral to posteromedial rotation. Aberrant anatomy is commonly seen during LC. We have routinely espoused the critical view technique or the use of intraoperative cholangiogram and believe that it should be applied to aid in the identification of the cystuc duct (CD).

On the first episode, he had been admitted to our hospital with elevated serum amylase levels and epigastralgia. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a diffuse, uncircumscribed area with heterogeneous density in the pancreas. No previous history of pancreatitis, gallstones, drinking, or abdominal injury was elicited. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) demonstrated that the Wirsung duct was unconnected to the Santorini's duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography through the papilla of Vater and accessory papilla revealed an enlarged ventral pancreatic duct, pancreas divisum, and a cystic lesion in the pancreatic body. On the second and third episodes, endoscopic drainage of the pancreatic pseudocysts through the accessory papilla and ultrasonography-guided transmural drainage were unsuccessful. A follow-up CT and MRCP demonstrated that the pancreatic cyst had enlarged to 9 x 8 cm in diameter. A laparoscopy-assisted cystgastrostomy was performed with an intragastric approach. An anastomosis was performed using an endoscopic linear stapler through the small cystotomy and gastrotomy openings on the posterior wall of the stomach. The postoperative clinical course was uneventful. Over 6 months later, the patient remains well and with a good quality of life. A laparoscopy-assisted cystgastrostomy, using an intragastric surgical technique, offers a safe, less-invasive procedure for cyst drainage by the pancreas divisum."

Unrecognized bile duct injuries present with biliary peritonitis and systemic sepsis. Bile has been shown to cause damage to the vascular wall and therefore delay the healing of injured arteries leading to pseudoaneurysm formation.

CD009323,0,17538488,0,The role of sonography in imaging of the biliary tract.,"Sonography is the recommended initial imaging test in the evaluation of patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain or jaundice. Dependent upon clinical circumstances, the differential diagnosis includes choledocholithiasis, biliary stricture, or tumor. Sonography is very sensitive in detection of mechanical biliary obstruction and stone disease, although less sensitive for detection of obstructing tumors, including pancreatic carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. In patients with sonographically documented cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis, laparoscopic cholecystectomy with operative clearance of the biliary stone disease is usually performed. In patients with clinically suspected biliary stone disease, without initial sonographic documentation of choledocholithiasis, endoscopic ultrasound or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is the next logical imaging step. Endoscopic ultrasound documentation of choledocholithiasis in a postcholecystectomy patient should lead to retrograde cholangiography, sphincterotomy, and clearance of the ductal calculi by endoscopic catheter techniques. In patients with clinical and sonographic findings suggestive of malignant biliary obstruction, a multipass contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) examination to detect and stage possible pancreatic carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, or periductal neoplasm is usually recommended. Assessment of tumor resectability and staging can be performed by CT or a combination of CT and endoscopic ultrasound, the latter often combined with fine needle aspiration biopsy of suspected periductal tumor. In patients whose CT scan suggests hepatic hilar or central intrahepatic biliary tumor, percutaneous cholangiography and transhepatic biliary stent placement is usually followed by brushing or fluoroscopically directed fine needle aspiration biopsy for tissue diagnosis. Sonography is the imaging procedure of choice for biliary tract intervention, including cholecystostomy, guidance for percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, and drainage of peribiliary abscesses."

We report a case of a surgically confirmed insulinoma diagnosed by a mild elevation in proinsulin with suppressed insulin and C-peptide at the time of hypoglycemia during a supervised fast. A supervised fast with serial measurements of plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide was performed in a patient with documented hypoglycemia. Proinsulin was measured at the beginning and end of the fast. Tumor localization was accomplished with spiral CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopic ultrasound. Minimally invasive tumor resection was performed. The presence of an insulinoma was confirmed on the basis of a minimally elevated proinsulin level with a suppressed insulin level at the time of symptomatic hypoglycemia. Tumor resection was performed without complications, resulting in resolution of the hypoglycemia. This case demonstrates the importance of measuring proinsulin as a routine component of the 72-hour fast for detection of an insulinoma. Even mild elevations in circulating proinsulin can be an independent indicator of aberrant insulin secretion during hypoglycemia. Once the diagnosis of insulinoma is made and tumor localization is achieved, minimally invasive tumor resection is a safe and effective treatment modality."

They are usually less frequent in patients with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction, but also this technique does not surely prevent SPG. Recently, some new technique have been proposed in order to prevent the PGS. Most of them are based upon a less extensive resection of the viscus, replaced by application of simple stapler mediated interruptions (the so called ""uncut"" technique).

CD009323,0,17484001,0,Medially approached radical lymph node dissection along the surgical trunk for advanced right-sided colon cancers.,"Although laparoscopic surgery is one of the treatment options for colorectal cancer, certain technical problems remain unresolved for the radical dissection of regional lymph nodes (LNs), which is essential to improve treatment outcome. We present a safe procedure for laparoscopic right hemicolectomy to dissect the regional LNs along the superior mesenteric vein (SMV). The key characteristic of our procedure is that all right and middle colic vessels are cut along the surgical trunk using only a medial approach. First, the pedicle of ileocolic vessels is identified and the mesocolon is dissected between the pedicle and the periphery of the SMV to expose the second portion of the duodenum. The ileocolic vessels are then cut at their roots. The ascending mesocolon is separated from the retroperitoneal tissues, duodenum, and pancreatic head up to the hepatocolic ligament cranially. The important detail in this procedure is the wide separation between the pancreatic head and the transverse mesocolon. This procedure uncovers the course of the right colic artery, veins, and the gastrocolic trunk. The right colic artery and veins can then be safely cut at their roots. For an extended right hemicolectomy, the middle colic vessels can easily be identified below the lower edge of the pancreas and cut at their roots. We performed curative resections in this manner for 16 consecutive patients with advanced right-sided colon cancer without any serious intraoperative complications. The median number of retrieved lymph nodes was 31 (range = 9-57). The median operative time and intraoperative blood loss were 274 min (range = 147-431 min) and 45 g (range = 0-120 g), respectively. The postoperative course of all patients was uneventful. Four of 16 patients had node-positive disease. With a median follow-up period of 272 days, all patients are alive without recurrence. We consider this a safe method for radical LN dissection during laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.

Recent studies showed that aggressive radical resection for advanced gallbladder carcinoma can give an acceptable prognosis. However, recurrence frequently remains the main problem after curative resection of advanced gallbladder carcinoma. The aim of this study was to identify the patterns and risk factors of recurrence after curative resection for stage II gallbladder carcinoma. Between January 1991 and December 2003, 100 patients received radical curative resection for gallbladder carcinoma at Yonsei University Medical Center. Of these, 77 were defined with stage II gallbladder carcinoma according to the Union Internationale Contre Le Cancer classification (sixth edition). Of the 77 patients, 67 were reviewed for the predictors of tumor recurrence. Among the 67 patients, 38 (56.7%) suffered a recurrence. The mean length to the recurrence was 21.1 +/- 26.7 months, with the most common site being the intraabdominal organs: liver and aortocaval lymph nodes. Infiltrating and poorly differentiated types were identified as independent prognostic factors of recurrence after curative resection for stage II gallbladder carcinoma and it suggests that large multicenter randomized control trials are necessary to clarify the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in these patients."

Ultrasonography and computed tomography scans showed an intra-abdominal collection and ERCP showed a cystic duct stump leak. A biliary stent was inserted and the collection was percutaneously drained. His symptoms, however, recurred 2 weeks later, with fever, anorexia, and weight loss. Abdominal computed tomography scan showed 9.3x8.5 cm cystic mass in the left hypochondriac area and ERCP showed persistent leakage from the cystic duct stump. The stent was changed to a larger size Fr12 and the collection was again drained percutaneously. His clinical condition improved dramatically. The biliary stent was removed after 8 weeks and remained well at 9-month follow-up."

CD009323,0,17415347,0,Endoscopic frontiers in the field of hepatology.,"Hepatology is considered a cognitive specialty, but it will not be surprising if a subgroup of future hepatologists (''invasive hepatologists'') performed a variety of advanced endoscopic, laparoscopic, vascular or ablative procedures just like interventional gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists or minimally invasive surgeons. The increase in the prevalence of liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma, and effective treatment of end-stage liver disease with liver transplantation has expanded the subspecialty of hepatology into a major specialty. Therefore, it is only natural that some of the trainees in hepatology, familiar with invasive procedures just like their counterparts in gastroenterology, may become subspecialized in invasive aspects of this specialty, traditionally performed by interventional endoscopists, radiologists and surgeons. Moreover, there will be major developments in the management of the complications of liver disease. Endoscopic screening with esophageal capsule endoscopy and, to a lesser extent, ultrathin upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may replace conventional endoscopy. In addition to standard treatments for esophageal varices, removable esophageal stents with expansile pressure may be utilized in refractory variceal hemorrhage. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts may be performed by hepatologists. Advances in argon plasma coagulation, cryotherapy and photodynamic therapy may result in novel treatment options for portal hypertensive gastropathy. Single-fiber cholangioscopy will allow for directed endoscopic screening for cholangiocarcinoma and primary sclerosing cholangitis in high-risk individuals. Minilaparoscopy will allow a macroscopic assessment of the liver surface as well as the ability to target specific regions for histopathology, and treatment including radiofrequency ablation of liver cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may provide the potential to directly measure portal vein pressure and this may have a future role in titration and optimization of pharmacological therapy of portal hypertension. EUS and fine needle aspiration may be used for staging hepatocellular and bile duct cancer. Finally, natural orifice transluminal surgery and endoscopic ultrasound-guided angiography may allow for targeted therapies traditionally outside the realm of the hepatologists."

CD009323,0,17410453,0,Arterial embolization for hemorrhage caused by hepatic arterial injury.,"Fewer than 10% of patients with major liver trauma have life-threatening bleeding. Laparoscopic operations, endoscopic procedures, and percutaneous interventions such as drainages, vascular or tumor sclerosis, biopsies, and transjugular intrahepatic portocaval shunt (TIPS) have increased the number of iatrogenic vascular and bile duct injuries. Due to its therapeutic success, arterial embolization (AE) has become the standard treatment for late complications of hepatic injury. In some cases, this procedure may be used as the first approach on accidental or iatrogenic arterial trauma and in several hepatic arterial diseases. The result of this method depends on physician experience, size of the wound, and stability of the patient. Persistent hemorrhage and rebleeding may be treated with a new AE or an operation. Precise indication and a correctly performed AE are key factors for a successful treatment. Rebleeding episodes are a rare occurrence, which may be treated with AE as well."

CD009323,0,17391625,0,Mirizzi syndrome.,"Mirizzi syndrome is an important complication of gallstone disease. If not recognized preoperatively, it can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Preoperative diagnosis may be difficult despite the availability of multiple imaging modalities. Ultrasonography (US), CT, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are common initial tests for suspected Mirizzi syndrome. Typical findings on US suggestive of Mirizzi syndrome are a shrunken gallbladder, impacted stone(s) in the cystic duct, a dilated intrahepatic tree, and common hepatic duct with a normal-sized common bile duct. The main role of CT is to differentiate Mirizzi syndrome from a malignancy in the area of porta hepatis or in the liver. MRI and MRCP are increasingly playing an important role and have the additional advantage of showing the extent of inflammation around the gallbladder that can help in the differentiation of Mirizzi syndrome from other gallbladder pathologies such as gallbladder malignancy. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the gold standard in the diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome. It delineates the cause, level, and extent of biliary obstruction, as well as ductal abnormalities, including fistula. ERCP also offers a variety of therapeutic options, such as stone extraction and biliary stent placement. Percutaneous cholangiogram can provide information similar to ERCP; however, ERCP has an additional advantage of identifying a low-lying cystic duct that may be missed on percutaneous cholangiogram. Wire-guided intraductal US can provide high-resolution images of the biliary tract and adjacent structures. Treatment is primarily surgical. Open surgery is the current standard for managing patients with Mirizzi syndrome. Good short- and long-term results with low mortality and morbidity have been reported with open surgical management. Laparoscopic management is contraindicated in many patients because of the increased risk of morbidity and mortality associated with this approach. Endoscopic treatment may serve as an alternative in patients who are poor surgical candidates, such as elderly patients or those with multiple comorbidities. Endoscopic treatment also can serve as a temporizing measure to provide biliary drainage in preparation for an elective surgery."
CD009323,0,17390188,0,Absorbable mesh reinforcement of a stapled pancreatic transection line reduces the leak rate with distal pancreatectomy.,"Pancreatic leak remains a significant cause of morbidity after distal pancreatectomy. We report the use of an absorbable mesh to reinforce a stapled pancreatic transection line for distal pancreatectomy. Forty consecutive distal pancreatectomies (33 open and 7 laparoscopic) were performed since the introduction of mesh reinforcement. We utilized an inclusive definition of pancreatic leak to critically evaluate the staple line reinforcement material. In addition, we compared the pancreatic leak rate for this case series with the antecedent 40 cases where mesh reinforcement was not available. In the prospective series there was 1 leak in 29 cases (3.5%) in which mesh reinforcement was utilized, and 4 leaks in 11 cases (36%) when mesh was not utilized (p < 0.005). The 12.5% leak rate for the 40 cases during the prospective period, compared favorably to the 27.5% leak rate for the 40 cases preceding the study period (p = 0.09). Twenty-nine cases receiving mesh compared favorably to the 23 stapled cases in the control series, reducing leak rate from 22 to 3.5% (p = 0.04). Mesh reinforcement of the stapled pancreatic transection line reduced the pancreatic leak rate after distal pancreatectomy. Mesh reinforcement was possible with open or laparoscopic resections. No complications were attributable to the use of absorbable mesh."

On postoperative day 7, she experienced sudden abdominal pain accompanied by vomiting and fever. Computed tomography showed a small bowel obstruction caused by an internal hernia. Laparotomy revealed an internal hernia through the mesenteric defect at the anastomotic colonic stumps, which had not been closed in the previous operation. Almost the entire small bowel protruding through the mesenteric defect was found in the omental bursa. We resected part of the jejunal loop, which was strangulated and congested by an adherent band. Our experience suggests that if the mesenteric defect is relatively small, it should be closed completely during laparoscopy-assisted colectomy; however, more studies are required to determine the indications for closure of the mesenteric defect to prevent this complication."

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan at a local hospital revealed heterogeneous enhancement of a mass which is 5 cm in diameter, located near the surface of the spleen, diagnosed as hemangioma. She had an investigation with Levovist-enhanced ultrasonography and superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging on T2-weighted gradient-echo imaging, which showed a hypervascular echoic mass and a decrease of signal intensity. The imaging diagnosis was splenic hamartoma. She underwent laparoscopic splenectomy to prevent the spontaneous rupture. The splenic artery at the pancreas body was exposed, and doubly ligated by vessel clip and furthermore ligated by 3-0 silk. At the splenic hilum, the splenic artery and vein were dissected with the Endo GIA vascular linear cutting stapler. The spleen was captured into the Endocatch II retrieval bag and removed from a transverse lower abdominal (suprapubic) incision extended up 7 cm in length through a port site. In pathological findings, the tumor was compatible with hamartoma. Splenic hamartomas in pediatric patients have been described extremely rare.

Abdominal pain, biliary disorders, and acute pancreatitis are frequently observed but malignant degeneration is rare. A 70-year-old man had a history of epigastralgia associated with abnormal liver function tests suggesting gallstones. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, intraoperative cholangiography showed a 40-mm-diameter choledochocele associated with choledocholithiasis. A transcystic drain was placed after cholecystectomy had been completed. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography confirmed the diagnosis and a 45-mm-long endoscopic sphincterotomy successfully treated both lesions as confirmed by a transcystic cholangiogram showing a thin-walled common bile duct with no residual stones. This case illustrates that the diagnosis of choledochocele remains difficult in clinical practice and confirms that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is the best available diagnostic tool. Coexistent choledocholithiasis is observed in about 20% of choledochocele. Endoscopic sphincterotomy is feasible and effectively treats both lesions even in larger choledochoceles."

A 78-year-old male with a history of recurrent melena, hematemesis, and right upper abdominal pain was admitted to our emergency department. His blood pressure was 60/30 mm Hg with a pulse rate of 100 beats per minute. Hemoglobin was 7.6 g/dL and white blood cell count 19500/mm(3). Computed tomography scan of the abdomen and selective digital subtraction arteriography showed a pseudoaneurysm in the region of the former bed of the gallbladder. During gastroscopy, a pulsatile bleeding out of the papilla of Vater was found. Surgery by the open approach confirmed the presence of a cystic artery pseudoaneurysm and showed an additional fistula between the pseudoaneurysm and the cystic bile duct. Resection of the pseudoaneurysm and revision of the common bile duct with implantation of a T-tube was performed. The patient recovered well and was discharged from our hospital three weeks after surgery."

Clinical manifestations include adrenergic and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Diagnosis is established through demonstration of inappropriately elevated insulin serum concentrations in the presence of hypoglycemia. The aim of this study is to show our experience in the management of insulinoma. Since 1988, 23 women (48 +/- 18 years) and 14 men (45 +/- 19 years) were studied. Seventy three percent of them suffered mainly from neuroglucopenic symptoms while 27% referred adrenergic signs. Mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 2.7 +/- 2 years. Mean fasting serum glucose was 32.4 +/- 8.7 mg/dl, insulin 38.2 +/- 39.7 microU/ml (RIA, n=11) or 23.8 +/- 18.1 microU/ml (chemoluminescence, n=26) and C-peptide 1.15 +/- 1.60 nmol/l (n=14). Twenty one patients developed clinical and/or biochemical hypoglycaemia within 9.0 +/- 5.2 hours of supervised fast. Preoperative localization was performed in 73% by imaging techniques, arterial calcium stimulation and/or intraoperative ultrasonography and palpation by the surgeon. Thirty six patients were operated on by conventional surgery in 25, or laparoscopic approach in 11 cases. In 22 patients, a solitary tumor was excised (61.1%). Six cases presented multiple insulinomas. Five patients had malignant insulinomas. In one case, a pattern of nesidioblastosis was found and 2 patients presented unspecific findings. In 3 patients another tumour (glucagonoma) was found (1 of them with MEN 1). One patient was treated with verapamil with good clinical response. Mean postoperative follow up was 60.4 +/- 59.9 months."

CD009323,0,17216828,0,Utility of liver function tests after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Many surgeons routinely obtain liver function tests (LFTs) after all laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Others argue that LFTs provide no useful information and add time and expense to the patient's hospitalization. This purpose of this study was to determine if routine postoperative LFTs predict complications. One hundred ninety-nine consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included in the analysis. Nine (4.5%) patients had postoperative complications: eight with retained common bile duct stones and one with a cystic duct stump leak. All were diagnosed with postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Only four of the nine patients had hyperbilirubinemia. Overall, 39 patients had postcholecystectomy hyperbilirubinemia, with four (10%) patients having complications (three retained stones and one had a bile leak). For the entire study population, there was no difference between pre- and postoperative total bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase levels (0.6 vs 0.6 mg/dL; P = 0.623 and 25 vs 41 U/L; P = 0.111, respectively). There was a statistically significant difference in pre- and postoperative alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase (31 vs 50 U/L; P = 0.003 and 95 vs 90 U/L; P = 0.001, respectively). Postoperative elevations in liver function tests are frequently seen after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. These elevations do not predict postoperative complications. LFTs should be obtained only when clinically indicated."

Three months earlier he had undergone an extensive evaluation for a single episode of melaena, including upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, colonoscopy to the caecum, enteroscopy and an abdominal ultrasound scan, that were negative. He was then submitted to the video capsule endoscopy (Given Imaging Ltd, Yoqneam, Israel) that revealed a polypoid white-yellowish lesion in the mid portion of the jejunum. The patient was admitted to our Department of Surgery in January 2005. During the operation, performed by laparoscopic video-assisted approach, the lesion, measuring 1.5x2 cm, was found at about 100 cm from the ligament of Treitz and was successfully excised. At histology, the final diagnosis was submucosal lymphangioma. The lymphangioma is a benign neoplastic lesion of the lymphatic system that usually is present in infancy and is found, in the majority of the patients, in the subcutaneous tissue outside the abdomen. The intrabdominal site accounts for less than 1% of the cases, and often occurs in the mesentery of the small bowel. Finding the lesion in the submucosa of the jejunum in an adult is very rare. The case here reported seems unusual to the Authors and worthy of publication because of the chronic, ambiguous clinical symptomatology, the occult digestive blood loss, and all the diagnostic examinations resulting negative, except for the video-capsule endoscopy. Moreover, the choice of the laparoscopic video-assisted technique, confirming the expected site of the lesion, with a ''minimal'' small bowel resection, made the postoperative course of the patient very short and uneventful. He is well and free of disease one year after the intervention. From a brief review of surgical literature, the case reported is the second one detected by the video capsule endoscopy and the fifth operated on by laparoscopy."

More than 400 cases of this well-described clinical presentation of advanced gastrointestinal and gynecologic cancers have been reported. Pancreatic cancer presenting as a SMJN is a rare phenomenon. In most series, the pancreas is the source of a SMJN in 7% to 9% of cases. We report a case of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in which the initial presenting sign was a SMJN. We also reviewed the published literature from the last 100 years on this phenomenon by conducting a detailed PubMed search. Including this case, we identified 57 cases of SMJN originating from the pancreas. The clinical patient characteristics with regard to age, male-female ratio, race, and prognosis of these cases were similar to that of pancreatic cancer in general. In contrast, 91% of these cases originated in the tail and body of the pancreas rather than the head of the pancreas. This case emphasizes that pancreatic cancer should be considered in the differential diagnosis of umbilical metastasis."
CD009323,0,21318953,0,A case of the primary small intestinal cancer which performed operation under laparoscopy after ileus decompression.,"The patient was a 66-year-old man with repeated episodes of abdominal pain resulting in a diagnosis of ileus, and he was admitted to this hospital. During hospitalization, the pain symptoms improved after the insertion of an ileus tube, but there was a recurrence of ileus after the patient was started on a liquid diet. An adhesive intestinal obstruction was thus suspected, and laparoscopy was performed. A diagnosis of small intestinal carcinoma was made based on the intraoperative findings. A partial resection of the small bowel and a regional lymphadenectomy were performed through a minor laparotomy. The incidence of primary small intestinal cancer has been relatively rare, and it is difficult to differentiate the disease in most cases. A laparoscopy is considered useful to diagnose and treat ileus after decompression of the intestinal tract, and this article describes the case with some discussion."

CD009323,0,17175453,1,The influence of positive peritoneal cytology on survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.,"The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for pancreatic adenocarcinoma classifies positive peritoneal cytology as stage IV disease. Data are limited with respect to the prevalence of positive peritoneal cytology and its influence on survival in patients with resectable, locally advanced, and metastatic disease. Four hundred sixty-two patients underwent staging laparoscopy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma between January 1995 and December 2005. Kaplan-Meier survival comparisons were performed to evaluate the significance of positive peritoneal cytology on overall survival (OS) in resected patients and patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease. Of the 462 patients, 47% (217/462) underwent a pancreatic resection. The 21% (95/462) with locally advanced disease and 32% (150/462) with metastatic disease did not undergo resection. Peritoneal cytology was positive in 17% (77/462), and was associated with stage of disease (metastatic, 37%; locally advanced, 11%; resected, 5%; P=0.01). Positive cytology was not associated with OS in patients with metastatic disease or locally advanced disease, but was in resected patients (median, 16 months vs. 8 months; P<0.001). Node-positive disease was present in 8 of 10 patients resected with positive cytology (2 years OS, 12% positive cytology vs. 23% negative; P=0.006). In this study, patients who underwent resection in the presence of positive peritoneal cytology and absence of other identifiable metastatic disease had a similar survival as other patients with stage IV disease."

CD009323,0,17168236,0,[Diagnosis and staging of carcinoma of the pancreas (I)].,"Carcinoma of the pancreas is a neoplasm with a poor prognosis that is diagnosed in the advanced stages in most patients. Given that surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for this disease, it is of the utmost importance to appropriately select the group of patients with initial stage pancreatic tumors that have not extended and can therefore be resected. Several different imaging techniques can be used for this purpose: ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), as well as the recent additions of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and positron emission tomography (PET). Other techniques, such as laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography, also play a role in the diagnosis and staging of these patients. Continual technological developments in each of the above-mentioned techniques have led to reiterated updates in the scientific literature throughout the last two decades. This review aims to evaluate each of these techniques and present diagnostic algorithms reflected in the literature in order to achieve the greatest diagnostic accuracy in determining the extent of the disease so that unnecessary surgery can be avoided in cases not susceptible to resection."
CD009323,0,17161176,0,Laparoscopic cystojejunostomy as a treatment option for pancreatic pseudocysts in children--a case report.,Pancreatic pseudocysts are a rare entity in children for which many approaches have been described. We report on the case of a 5-year-old boy with a pancreatic pseudocyst after blunt abdominal trauma. The patient's clinical and laboratory examination findings had also revealed an acute pancreatitis. His diagnostic workup included ultrasound examination and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Two large cysts were found at the tail of the pancreas. No injury of the pancreatic or bile duct was found. The child underwent successful laparoscopic cystojejunostomy. The patient was free of complaints after more than 2 years of follow-up.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes and costs among ES, OGJ, and LGJ in patients who present with gastroduodenal obstruction from advanced upper gastrointestinal tract cancer. We designed a model for patients with malignant gastroduodenal obstruction. We analyzed success rates, complication rates and costs of the three treatment modalities: ES, OGJ, and LGJ. Baseline outcomes and costs were based on published reports. Success was defined as no major procedure-related and long-term complications over a 1-month period. Failure of therapy was defined as recurrent symptoms or death due to a procedural complication. Sensitivity analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses for the various strategies were performed. ES resulted in the lowest mortality rate and the lowest cost of the three treatment options analyzed. Mortality in the OGJ group was 2.1 times that in the ES cohort and 1.8 times that in the LGJ cohort. Sensitivity analyses confirmed ES as the dominant strategy. In conclusion, ES is the preferred treatment for palliation of duodenal obstruction due to advanced upper gastrointestinal tract cancer."
CD009323,0,17160468,0,The outcome assessment of double-balloon enteroscopy for diagnosing and managing patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.,"Diagnosing and treating patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding is clinically challenging. Most lesions responsible for the origin of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding are located in the small bowel. Double-balloon enteroscopy is a novel method for exploring the small intestine and has significant therapeutic potential. This study evaluated the value of double-balloon enteroscopy in diagnosing and managing obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. From October 2003 to January 2006, a total of 20 patients (6 men, 14 women; mean age, 55.2 years old) with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (18 obscure overt bleeding, 2 obscure occult bleeding) were investigated by double-balloon enteroscopy. A total of 29 procedures (15 via oral approach and 14 via rectal approach) were performed. The diagnostic yield, endoscopic therapeutic procedures, complications, and outcome were then assessed. Small bowel lesions potentially responsible for the bleeding were identified in 15 (75%) of 20 patients, including 9 angiodysplasias, 2 gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), 2 ulcers, 1 jejunal granulation polyp, and 1 Peutz-Jeghers polyposis. Endoscopic treatments including heater probe coagulation, polypectomy, and endoscopic mucosal resection were performed in 11 patients. Two patients with GISTs received surgical intervention. Two patients with angiodysplasias that endoscopic treatment failed underwent laparoscopic resections following tattooing. There were no complications and the procedures were tolerated well. Among the 15 patients who had a lesion identified with subsequent treatment, rebleeding occurred in 3 (20%) patients with angiodysplasias. Of the five patients in whom no definite lesion was detected, rebleeding developed in four (80%). For patients with an identified lesion that was further treated, the rebleeding rate was lower than for those with ""persistent"" obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (P=0.031). We conclude that double-balloon enteroscopy offers a safe and effective method for diagnosing and managing patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding."

CD009323,0,17149628,0,Diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP in the pediatric age group.,"The role and value of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the pediatric age group is not well established, because pancreatic and biliary diseases are less common in children. This however is not the case in areas like the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia where sickle cell disease (SCD) and other hemoglobinopathies are common, with increased frequency of cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the indications, findings, safety and therapies of ERCP in children. One hundred and twenty five children had diagnostic and/or therapeutic ERCP as part of their management at our hospital. Their medical records were reviewed for: age at diagnosis, sex, Hb electrophoresis, indication for ERCP, findings, therapy and complications. There were 77 males and 48 females. Their age at presentation ranged from 5-18 year (mean 13.25 year). The majority of them had sickle cell disease (77.6%). The indications for ERCP were: obstructive jaundice (67.2%), recurrent biliary colic with or without jaundice (10.4%), acute and chronic pancreatitis (7.2%), postoperative bile leak (2.4%), cholangitis with obstructive jaundice (2.4%), hepatitis of unknown etiology (3.2%), cirrhosis of unknown etiology (4%), thalassemia with jaundice (0.8%), hemobilia (0.8%), acute cholecystitis with jaundice (0.8%), and sickle cell disease with ulcerative colitis and obstructive jaundice (0.8%). In six children, ERCP was done following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ERCP was carried out under sedation in 91 (72.8%) children and under general anesthesia in 34. It was successful in 121 (96.8%) children while cannulation of the Ampulla failed in four. ERCP was normal in 43 children, but eight of them showed evidence of recent stone passage and in six, there were gallstones. In the remaining children, ERCP revealed: normal CBD with stones (18 patients), dilated CBD with stones (17 patients), dilated CBD without stones (19 patients), dilated biliary tree with stones (10 patients), dilated biliary tree without stones (six patients), bile leak (two patients), dilated biliary tree with stones and choledocho-duodenal fistula (one patient), choledochal cyst (two patients), septate gallbladder (one patient), normal ERCP with multiple pancreatic cysts (one patient) and biliary stricture (one patient). The following procedures were carried out: 35 had endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction, 20 had endoscopic sphincterotomy, four had CBD stenting, one underwent removal of a stent, two had insertion of a nasobiliary tube and one had biliary endoprosethesis. There was no mortality. One had bleeding from the site of sphincterotomy which stopped after adrenaline injection. Four patients (3.2%) developed transient mild pancreatitis which settled conservatively. ERCP in the pediatric age group is safe both as a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. ERCP can provide valuable information which aid in the diagnosis of biliary and pancreatic diseases in children as well as therapy with the technical feasibility of endoscopic sphincterotomy. This is specially so in the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, where ERCP should be the treatment of choice in children with CBD stones who are going or have previously undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy."

CD009323,0,17139439,0,Gallbladder metastases from ductal papillary carcinoma of the breast.,"Breast cancer occurs primarily in women aged 25 years or older. Breast carcinoma has the potential for widespread dissemination, such as metastasis to axillary lymph nodes, bone, lung, pleura, brain, and soft tissues. Liver, gastrointestinal, and biliary tract involvement are infrequent. We report a patient, a 62-year-old woman, with symptomatic cholelithiasis. The patient proceeded to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. She had a previous history of mastectomy with axillary lymphadenectomy, performed for a breast ductal papillary carcinoma, 10 years prior to the cholecystectomy. The gallbladder was hydropic; the wall was thickened, with a focal broad-based lesion on the mesenteric face of the body. Histopathological evaluation of the focal broad-based lesion of the gallbladder revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma infiltration, without mucosal involvement. Subsequent immunohistochemical examination showed the lesion to be cytokeratin 7(CK7)-positive and cytokeratin 20 (CK20)-negative. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) were positive. The final pathological diagnosis was breast ductal papillary carcinoma metastases to the gallbladder. Mammography of the other breast was normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed, without any pathological findings. Bone Tc-99 scintigraphy was normal. Six months after the surgery positron emission tomography (PET) showed no evidence of metastatic disease. Two years after the surgery, the patient died, in the absence of recurrence. A literature review revealed only a few more cases of metastasic breast carcinoma to the gallbladder."

Diagnostic tools currently available are therefore either performed too late or are not able to detect early disease stage. Imaging procedures for diagnosis and staging are ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging with cholangiopancreaticography, intravenous bolus-enhanced spiral computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography. Before initiating any palliative measure, a proper staging and a surgical consultation at a hepatobiliary center is necessary. To assess resectability, additional diagnostic methods like angiography, positron emission tomography, cholangioscopy, endoscopic or intraluminal ultrasonography and finally even explorative laparoscopy may be required. At time of diagnosis only a small percentage of Klatskin tumors is curative resectable. Therefore, palliative treatment options play an important role. Endoprostheses insertion is the method of choice to relieve jaundice. Although it improves quality of life, it does not seem to improve survival time. Definitive evidence for a benefit of additional radio and/or chemotherapy is still missing. Photodynamic therapy, a light therapy, is the first approach leading to an improvement of cholestasis and quality of life as well as to a prolongation of survival time. PDT should therefore be offered to all patients with nonresectable cholangiocarcinoma."

Recurrence is particularly common in patients with extrapancreatic neural invasion (EPNI), the presence of which correlates with poor prognosis. Macroscopic EPNI may be detected with conventional noninvasive imaging and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) imaging, but microscopic EPNI has required postoperative pathologic examination of surgical specimens.

However, IPAA can be complicated by postoperative small bowel obstruction, disease recurrence, and pouch failure secondary to pelvic sepsis, pouch dysfunction, mucosal inflammation, and neoplastic transformation. These may necessitate emergent or expeditious elective reoperation to salvage the pouch and preserve adequate function. Local, transanal, and transabdominal approaches to IPAA salvage are described, and their indications, outcomes, and the clinical parameters that affect the need for salvage are discussed. Pouch excision for failed salvage reoperation is reviewed as well. Relaparotomy is also frequently required for recurrent Crohn's disease (CD), especially given the nature of this as yet incurable illness. Risk factors for CD recurrence are examined, and the various surgical options and margins of resection are evaluated with a focus on bowel-sparing policy. Stricturoplasty, its outcomes, and its importance in recurrent disease are discussed, and segmental resection is compared with more extensive procedures such as total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis. Lastly, laparoscopy is addressed with respect to its long-term outcomes, effect on surgical recurrence, and its application in the management of recurrent CD."
CD009323,0,17066269,0,[Staging laparoscopy in oncology].,"The availability of more treatment options for gastrointestinal cancer requires precise and reliable pretherapeutic staging. Despite impressive technical progress in modern imaging procedures, this high level of staging quality is not yet warranted in all instances. Visual exploration of the abdominal cavity in extended diagnostic laparoscopy (EDL), including surgical dissection of areas which are primarily inaccessible, biopsy retrieval, and laparoscopic ultrasound, is superior in the diagnostic workup of early peritoneal carcinomatosis and (small) liver metastases. It is helpful to evaluate lymph node infliction and local resectability. In esophageal carcinoma, pretherapeutic EDL is valuable in case of advanced adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus (AEG I according to Siewert), whereas the incidence of abdominal tumor manifestations in squamous cell carcinoma is too low to perform staging laparoscopy. In advanced gastric cancer, EDL yields relevant additional information in up to 20% of cases. If a multimodal therapeutic strategy is considered, EDL should be obligatory at least in prospective therapeutic studies. In carcinoma of the pancreas, EDL is in general not recommended by the majority of centers. Selective use (in particular in advanced cancer with a high probability of local irresectability) is gaining importance. In hepatobiliary malignancy including colorectal metastases, the high yield of additional information by EDL was confirmed in recent studies."

It can be surgically managed by open or laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy. This study aimed to compare the results of open and laparoscopic palliative gastrojejunostomy for patients with gastric outlet obstruction resulting from inoperable neoplasms. A total of 24 patients were randomized prospectively to undergo laparoscopic (12 patients) or open (12 patients) palliative laterolateral antecolic isoperistaltic gastrojejunostomy. All the procedures were completed as planned. The mean duration of surgery was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.75). The mean intraoperative blood loss was significantly less after laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy (LGJ) (p = 0.0001). Time to oral solid food intake was longer after open gastrojejunostomy (OGJ) (p = 0.04). Two patients in the OGJ group experienced postoperative delayed gastric empting, whereas no patients in the LGJ group experienced such a complication (p = 0.04). The mean postoperative stay was shorter in the LGJ group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.65). No readmissions were registered after a minimum follow-up period of 2 months. The findings show that LGJ is a safe, feasible, and effective alternative to OGJ. However, because the current data involved only a small number of patients, large studies still are required for further evaluation of the this operation's effectiveness."

Although this tumor can affect any portion of the biliary tree, intrahepatic location is more common. It is usually a slow growing tumor and often asymptomatic until it reaches a considerable size. The lesion is most often solitary and large when discovered; multiple lesions or metastases within the liver are very rare. A 63-year-old man was referred to our institute for weight loss, abdominal discomfort, worsening bulky symptoms in the right upper abdominal quadrant, and an increase in serum aminotransferases that had been present for several months. Spiral CT of the abdomen demonstrated two lesions, a larger one and a distant intrahepatic lesion, with a multiloculated cystic aspect, a thin peripheral capsule, multiple solid peripheral portions, and irregular septa enhancing in the portal phase after intravenous administration of iodinated contrast medium.

CD009323,0,17031713,0,Histological evaluation of the testicular nubbins in patients with nonpalpable testis: assessment of etiology and surgical approach.,"There is a controversy in the literature whether testicular nubbins carry malignancy risk and excision of the nubbin is necessary in patients with nonpalpable testis. It is also controversial whether vanishing testis has the same etiopathogenesis and risk with true undescended testis. The aim of this study is to investigate the histological findings of testicular nubbins in patients with nonpalpable testis and to question etiology and surgical indications for vanishing testis. We reviewed the histopathological results of 44 testicular nubbins in 40 patients (mean age: 4.1 years, range 1-13 years) with nonpalpable testis between 1992 and 2004, retrospectively. Exploration revealed 5 intraabdominal and 39 inguinal testicular nubbins. Of 44 specimens only 5 (11.3%) from inquinal testicular nubbins were found to have seminiferous tubules. Two of the five had seminiferous tubule structures with viable germ cells showing maturation correlating with age. The other two with scarce seminiferous tubules were seen on only a single area and one had Sertoli cells only. None of the excised tissue had malignant degeneration. The vas deferens was identified in 23 (52.2%), vessels in 26 (59%), calcification in 14 (31.8%) and hemosiderin in 12 (27.2%) of excised tissue. Presence of calcification in one-third of the nubbins supports vascular accident thesis in the etiopathogenesis of vanishing testis. The possibility for the presence of seminiferous tubules and viable germ cells in the testicular nubbin is low. These facts decrease theoritical risk of malingnancy. Therefore, an inguinal exploration for testicular nubbin in patients with vas deferens and vessels entering into the inquinal canal diagnosed at laparoscopy can be postponed untill testicular prosthesis implantation and the nubbin can be removed at this operation."
CD009323,0,17031198,0,Pancreatic surgery.,"Recent advances have been made in both laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques for diagnosing and treating pancreatic neoplasms. These advances are reviewed. In addition to the traditional methods of pancreatic resection (eg, standard Whipple and pylorus-preserving Whipple), several other techniques have been described and are discussed (eg, median pancreatectomy and extended pancreatectomy). The morbidity and mortality rates of pancreatic operations have diminished, but significant complications still occur (eg, delayed gastric emptying, pancreatic fistula, and biliary strictures). These are discussed. In managing acute and chronic pancreatitis, less invasive and more conservative approaches are being advocated."
CD009323,0,17031114,0,Pancreatic surgery.,"Several important advances in pancreatic surgery have been made over the past year. As in other areas of general surgery, laparoscopic techniques are being used with increasing frequency, but their real value remains to be determined. Methods to stage pancreatic cancer, perform palliative bypass, relieve pain, and perform distal pancreatic resections have been described. Using more conventional surgical approaches, data continue to accumulate about pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy as an alternative to the standard operation. The survival benefit of extended pancreatic resection for pancreatic cancer remains dubious. Studies continue to demonstrate lower morbidity and mortality rates for pancreaticoduodenectomy performed at high-volume centers. In the arena of chronic pancreatitis, pain relief is still the most common reason for surgical treatment, and the efficacy of various operations has been assessed by some new studies. Data continue to show that aggressive surgical treatment for infected necrosis leads to improved survival in patients with severe acute pancreatitis."
CD009323,0,17029157,0,Current status of laparoscopic ultrasound.,"The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the beginning surgeon ultrasonographer to the use of ultrasound during laparoscopic surgery. The authors routinely use ultrasound in the intraoperative, endoscopic, and office settings. The importance of ultrasound in the various surgical specialties is well documented in the literature. Since the introduction of minimally invasive techniques to General Surgery, many advanced applications of ultrasonography have been developed. Confident examinations of intraabdominal anatomy, pathologic conditions, and therapeutic procedures can readily be performed. In this chapter, a comprehensive introduction to laparoscopic ultrasound is presented to the practicing General Surgeon. The basic equipment requirements and setup are explained. Fundamental techniques of laparoscopic ultrasound examination are described. The authors' method of screening for common bile duct stones during routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy is illustrated. Examination of the normal biliary tree with helpful hints is presented. The authors' systematic technique of visualizing the normal liver parenchyma is described. Common benign and malignant findings are elucidated. A brief synopsis of pancreatic ultrasonography with attention to pathologic findings is provided. Uses of ultrasound in unanticipated situations are introduced. With perseverance, the reader will discover that laparoscopic ultrasound skills can be readily attained."

CD009323,0,17013718,0,Analysis of bile duct injuries (Stewart-Way classification) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"In order to investigate mechanisms underlying the occurrence of bile duct injuries (BDIs) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), we analyzed results for 34 patients (0.59%; 17 men, 17 women; average age, 57 years) with BDI out of 5750 LCs, based on questionnaire responses from surgical operators, records of direct interviews with these operators, operative reports, and videotapes of the operations. The indications for LC in the 34 patients were chronic cholecystitis in 32 patients and acute cholecystitis in 2. The BDIs in these patients were divided into four classes using the Stewart-Way classification: class I, incision (incomplete transection) of the common bile duct (CBD), n = 6 (17.6%); class II, lateral damage to the common hepatic duct (CHD), n = 9 (26.5%); class III, transection of the CBD or CHD, n = 15 (44.1%); and class IV, right hepatic duct or right segmental hepatic duct injuries, n = 4 (11.8%). In all class III and 3 class I cases (18 in total; incidence 53%), the mistake involved misidentifying the CBD as the cystic duct. Of all types (classes) of injuries, class III injuries showed the mildest gallbladder inflammation, and there was a significant (P = 0.0005) difference in the severity of inflammation between class II and III injuries. We conclude that complete transection of the CBD, which is rare in laparotomy, was the most common BDI pattern occurring during LC and that the underlying factor in the operator making this error was mistaking the CBD for the cystic duct."
CD009323,0,17013451,0,Diagnostic and therapeutic approach to pancreatic adenocarcinoma.,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death in Europe with survival rates remaining unchanged over the last three decades. Early diagnosis and accurate staging are essential due to the difficulty of curing this tumor in its advanced form. Endoscopic or laparoscopic ultrasonography and computed tomography are the preferred imaging and staging modalities for many patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Morbidity and mortality are similar for pylorus-preserving and classic pancreatico-duodenectomy. Extended retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy does not improve survival and increases morbidity compared with standard pancreaticoduodenectomy, while adjuvant chemoradiotherapy prolongs survival in selected groups of patients. This article reviews the causes, risk factors, and clinical features of pancreatic adeno-carcinoma and discusses the methods of optimal diagnosis, staging and treatment."
CD009323,0,17012149,0,Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with splenic preservation for serous cystadenoma: a case report and literature review.,"A minimally invasive approach can be beneficial in a spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. This article reports a 71-year-old woman who presented to her internist with hypertension and persistent hypokalemia. A computed tomography scan to rule out a functional adrenal mass incidentally revealed a 4 cm x 3 cm x 2 cm serous cystadenoma of the distal pancreas and normal adrenal glands. The patient was referred to the general surgery service for resection of the distal pancreatic lesion. A laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy was performed. The lesion was completely excised, and the pathology revealed serous cystadenoma with focal fibrosis and atrophic acini. The postoperative advantages of this approach were the early return of bowel function, minimal narcotic requirements, and early resumption of normal activities. This case illustrates the advantages of minimally invasive surgery in the performance of a spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy."
CD009323,0,17012148,0,A primer on natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery: building a new paradigm.,"Access to the abdominal cavity is required for diagnostic and therapeutic endeavors for a variety of medical and surgical diseases. Historically, abdominal access has required a formal laparotomy to provide adequate exposure. Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is an emerging experimental alternative to conventional surgery that eliminates abdominal incisions and incision-related complications by combining endoscopic and laparoscopic techniques to diagnose and treat abdominal pathology. During NOTES, commercially available flexible video endoscopes are used to create a controlled transvisceral incision via natural orifice access to enter the peritoneal cavity. Common incision-related complications such as wound infections, incisional hernias, postoperative pain, aesthetic disdain, and adhesions could be minimized or eliminated by NOTES. NOTES has evolved from more than 2 centuries of technological innovations and continued growth in the field of surgical endoscopy. Innovative surgical endoscopists have slowly developed means to surpass the constraints of the gastrointestinal lumen by using a flexible endoscope. The future of surgical endoscopy may be the shared entity of NOTES, which further integrates endoscopy, gastroenterology, and minimally invasive and general surgery. Although the promise of NOTES is electrifying to surgeons and endoscopists, several key issues need to be characterized prior to the incorporation of NOTES into routine practice. This article reviews the status, contemporary body of literature, limitations, and potential future implications accompanying the development of NOTES."

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was utilized to confirm the diagnosis of an impacted calculus within the remnant cystic duct along with several small retained common bile duct stones. Four sequential endoscopic procedures successfully removed all retained common bile duct calculi to alleviate the biliary obstruction; however, we were unable to treat the cystic duct remnant calculus endoscopically. The patient finally underwent successful laparoscopic excision of a 2.5-cm cystic duct remnant containing its impacted calculus. It remains unclear if cystic duct remnant calculi may become more prevalent as a cause of postcholecystectomy syndrome in future due to the large numbers of laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed in the past 2 decades."
CD009323,0,17004868,1,Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma benefit from staging laparoscopy.,"Unnecessary laparotomy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer may both compromise the quality of life and delay the initiation of more appropriate therapy.

CD009323,0,17004190,0,[Laparoscopic pancreatic resection].,Over a long time laparascopy for pancreatic diseases was performed only as staging laparoscopy in order to find hidden metastasis.

CD009323,0,16998691,0,Granular cell tumor as an unusual cause of obstruction at the hepatic hilum: report of a case.,"A diagnosis of malignancy is reasonably assumed when a lesion is found at the hilum or bile ducts in a patient with jaundice who has never undergone biliary surgery. Although benign tumors occasionally develop in this location, preoperative recognition is difficult and most are treated as malignant lesions. We illustrate this clinical scenario in this case report of a granular cell tumor (GCT) that developed at the biliary bifurcation, necessitating right hemi-hepatectomy with extrahepatic biliary tree excision. We describe the clinical presentation, imaging findings, treatment, and histological findings of this tumor. Although rare, a GCT can develop at the hilum and mimic a malignant lesion such as cholangiocarcinoma (CC) radiologically. To our knowledge, this is the fourth report of a GCT at the hilum of the liver. However, the possibility of this tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a lesion in this location."
CD009323,0,16997159,0,The role of surgery in patients with advanced gastric cancer.,"Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment with curative intent for established gastric cancer. Patient selection is critical to achieving satisfactory outcomes, and involves careful assessment of both patient fitness and disease stage. Staging techniques have multiplied and become much more sensitive in recent years. Current best practice involves a combination of spiral CT scan, Endoscopic ultrasound, PET scanning and laparoscopy. Only a minority of patients progress to potentially curative surgery after staging and fitness assessment in Western centres. Conventional treatment involves a distal subtotal gastrectomy or total gastrectomy depending on the site of the lesion. Innovative techniques include the Merendino operation, and pylorus and nerve sparing gastrectomies for earlier stage disease in the proximal and distal stomach, respectively. There is evidence of nutritional and quality of life benefit in the first 2 years after surgery from formation of a gastric substitute reservoir. Laparoscopic resection is well established in Japan and is developing rapidly elsewhere but its role and outcomes are not yet well defined. Radical lymph node dissection remains controversial: randomised trial evidence of overall benefit is lacking, but expert series have produced excellent results, and there are indications of a sub-group benefit for patients with stage II and III disease. The increased morbidity and mortality associated with radical dissection appear to be largely attributable to pancreatic and splenic resection together with limitations in Unit expertise. Surgical palliation has become less important in recent years as interventional radiology and endoscopy techniques have been developed for the same purposes. Overall mortality and survival results have improved dramatically over the last 20 years, but interpretation of these figures is made difficult by major changes in staging and case selection. The chances of long-term survival are, however, clearly much greater, and those of peri-operative death much less for an individual patient accepted for surgery in 2006 than they would have been in 1986."

CD009323,0,16966034,0,Management and outcome in patients with Klatskin-mimicking lesions of the biliary tree.,"The preoperative and even intraoperative differentiation between benign and malignant strictures at the hepatic hilum remains difficult. The aim of this study was to assess clinical, radiologic, intraoperative, and histopathologic findings; surgical treatment; and outcome of patients with Klatskin mimicking benign lesions. Of 49 consecutive patients who were operated on the initial preoperative radiologic diagnosis of hilar adenocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor), 7 (14%) had benign conditions after final histopathologic diagnosis. Pretreatment work-up, therapy, and outcome of these patients were analyzed. Based on preoperative clinical symptoms, imaging assessment, and CA19-9 values, all seven patients were classified as having malignant neoplasms. At laparotomy, the tumors of six patients were judged to be malignant. Five patients underwent hilar resection and concomitant liver resection, and two patients underwent hilar resection alone. There were no operative deaths. The definitive histopathologic examination showed severe cholangitis with extensive periductal fibrosis in all patients. After a median follow-up of 32 months, all patients are well. Clinical presentation and imaging assessment were similar for Klatskin tumors and benign fibrosing disease; therefore, an aggressive resectional approach is justified in any patient with suspicious obstruction of the liver hilum."

Only if a histologic or cytologic confirmation of the diagnosis is necessary, is a direct access to the biliary tract either with ERC or PTC justified as a diagnostic procedure. Due to technical advancements in laparoscopic surgery intraoperative bile duct revision has become a standard procedure for patients with choledocholithiasis discovered during cholecystectomy. It has been shown to be equally effective to ERC. In this setting ERC therefore has lost its unique claim for the treatment of bile duct stones, while it remains the treatment of choice in patients with prior cholecystectomy. In contrast ERC, sometimes in combination with PTC, has become the mainstay in the treatment of biliary lesions like leakage and benign strictures. The same is true for the palliation of malignant biliary strictures. Surgery should be reserved for patients in whom minimal invasive methods fail and for the curative treatment of malignant lesions."
CD009323,0,16933163,0,Endoscopic ultrasound of the upper gastrointestinal tract and mediastinum: diagnosis and therapy.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has developed significantly over the last two decades and has had a considerable impact on the imaging and staging of mass lesions within or in close proximity to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In conjunction with conventional imaging such as helical computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the indications for EUS include (1) differentiating between benign and malignant lesions of the mediastinum and upper GI tract, (2) staging malignant tumors of the lung, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas prior to surgery or oncological treatment, (3) excluding common bile duct stones before laparoscopic cholecystectomy, thereby avoiding the need for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in some patients, and (4) assessing suspected lesions that are either equivocal or not seen on conventional imaging. In recent years, EUS has charted a course similar to that taken by ERCP, evolving from a purely diagnostic modality to one that is interventional and therapeutic. These indications include (5) obtaining a tissue diagnosis by EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration or trucut-type needle biopsy and (6) providing therapy such as coeliac plexus neurolysis and pancreatic pseudocyst drainage--in many cases, more accurately and safely than conventional techniques. Emerging investigational techniques include EUS-guided enteric anastomosis formation and fine-needle injection therapy for malignant disease."
CD009323,0,16927915,0,Evaluation of perioperative cholangiography in one thousand laparoscopic cholecystectomies.,"We analyzed a teaching institution's experience with intra-operative cholangiography (IOCG) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and established an algorithm for their timing and use. The records of all patients undergoing LC during a five year period were reviewed. Patients with a history of jaundice or pancreatitis, abnormal bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, or radiographic evidence suggestive of choledocholithiasis were considered ""at risk"" for common bile duct stones (CBDS). The remaining patients were considered to be at low ""risk."" LC was attempted on 1002 patients during the study period and successfully completed on 941 (94% of the time). The major complication rate was 3.1% and the common bile duct injury rate 0.1%. Eighty eight (9.5%) patients underwent ERCP, 67 in the preoperative period and 19 in the postoperative period. IOCG was attempted in 272 (24%) patients and completed in 234 for a success rate of 86%. Intraoperative cholangiography (IOCG) and preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were equivalent in the detection of CBDSs Twelve of the 21 patients (57%) with IOCG positive for stones underwent successful laparoscopic clearance of the common duct, and did not require postop. ERCP. No patients were converted to an open procedure for common bile duct exploration. Because postoperative ERCP was 100% successful in clearing the common duct, reoperation for retained common bile duct stones was not necessary. IOCG is an alternative procedure to ERCP for patients at risk with biochemical, radiological, or clinical evidence of choledocholithiasis. The incidence of CBDS in low-risk patients is 1.7%, a risk that does not warrant routine cholangiography. Preoperative ERCP is recommended in cases of cholangitis unresponsive to antibiotics, suspicion of carcinoma, and biliary pancreatitis unresponsive to supportive care. Although IOCG leads to a similar percentage of nontherapeutic studies as preoperative ERCP, it often allows for one procedure therapy."
CD009323,0,16927912,0,[Surgical approach in acute necrotising pancreatitis].,"Acute necrotising pancreatitis is a dramatic and often life-threatening disease with a high rate of mortality, varying between 30-70% and necessitating heavy medical care. The surgical attitude regarding acute necrotising pancreatitis is disputed between the supporters of drainage with closed abdomen and the supporters of laparatomy with open drainage. The goal of this study is the evaluation of the number of intervention required, the timing of the interventions and the mortality and morbidity in a group of patients with necrotising pancreatitis. The studied group consists in 112 patients with necrotising pancreatitis, treated in Surgical Clinic of Caritas ""Prof. Dr. N. Cajal"" Clinical Hospital, Bucharest during 1983-2005. Infection of pancreatic necrosis supervened in 55,35% of patients in this group, not any pancreatic necrosis becomes infected. Infected necrosis is not synonymous for abscessed of necrosis, in the same patient pancreatic necrosis, infected pancreatic necrosis and abscessed necrosis may coexist. Clinical and biological criteria are the decisive factors in the indication for surgical treatment, the radiology being decisive in the choice of the laparotomy approach. In the study group 50,89% of patients necessitated only one surgical intervention. Implicitly, more than half of the patients would have been suffered multiple useless planned staged relaparotomies. The mortality in our study group treated by the method of closed drainage was 25,89%."
CD009323,0,16927911,0,[Surgical management of acute pancreatitis. One hundred years of evolution].,"The aim of the paperwork is to present the evolution of surgical management of acute pancreatitis for a period of more than a century, by using the literature data that reveal the important moments in the knowledge of patho-etiology, in clarifying the definition and classification and, last but not least, in the progress of biological and image exploration, the right timing and the permanent development of surgical procedures so that the general mortality should decrease up to 10-15%, as it nowadays. The need for surgical intervention in acute pancreatitis is the controversy that appeared during this period. Until the mid of the 20th century, mainly on the basis of the clinic diagnosis, only the severe cases were recognized and became subjects of surgical exploration, with disastrous results. A great step forward was the dosage of urinary and serum amylase that allowed the non-surgical diagnosis of the disease, so that some patients could be treated successfully without surgery. Introduction of prognosis criteria by Ranson, the dosage of C-reactive protein together with CT scanning of the injury: interstitial - edematous or necrosis,the fine needle aspiration for bacteriology and the adoption of a definition and unitary classification resulted in a major change in therapy, in general, and in the surgical procedures. Necrosectomy combined with a drainage method, practised and developed by Beger since 1982, becomes a surgical dogma. Minimally invasive procedures became a reliable alternative to classic procedures due to the diversity and permanent development of laparoscopic, endoscopic and radiologic techniques."

CD009323,0,16922261,0,"Laparoscopic surgery for cancer: historical, theoretical, and technical considerations.","Surgery for cancer carries concerns of tumor dissemination related to tumor manipulation, tumor violation, and wound seeding. Minimally invasive surgery is now standard for several benign conditions, such as symptomatic cholelithiasis and surgical therapy of gastroesophageal reflux. With the minimally invasive surgery explosion of the 1990s, virtually every procedure traditionally performed via laparotomy has been performed successfully with laparoscopic methods, including pancreaticoduodenectomy for cancer. Shortly after the first descriptions of laparoscopic-assisted colectomy, reports of port-site tumor recurrences surfaced, raising concerns of usingpneumoperitoneum-based surgery for malignancy. This review covers the development of laparoscopic surgery for cancer. Historical perspectives elucidate factors that helped shape the current state of the art. Theoretical concerns are discussed regarding surgery-induced immune suppression and its potential effects on tumor recurrence with both open and laparoscopic approaches. The concerns of laparoscopic port-site wound metastases are addressed, with a critical evaluation of the literature. Finally, a technical discussion of laparoscopic-assisted resections of hepatic and pancreatic tumors details patient selection, operative approach, and existing data for these operations."
CD009323,0,16921308,0,Laparoscopic excision of ciliated hepatic foregut cyst: a first report in Korea.,"Ciliated hepatic foregut cyst (CHFC) is very rare and apparently originated from embryologic foregut. It is generally benign, solitary cyst and microscopically consists of inner ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, subepithelial connective tissue, a smooth muscle layer, and outer fibrous capsule. Although ciliated cysts commonly arise from the tracheal bronchial tree and the esophagus, they could also be found in the liver with rare incidence. There are several reports indicating this lesion can cause clinical problems, such as biliary obstruction and malignant transformation. Herein, we present a case of 56-year-old male patient who recently underwent laparoscopic excision of CHFC, focusing our discussion on review of literatures and rationale of laparoscopic surgery on CHFC."
CD009323,0,16921307,0,Agenesis of the gallbladder with hypoplastic cystic duct diagnosed at laparoscopy.,"An 86-year-old man was admitted to our department with complaints of intermittent upper abdominal pain. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed dilated extrahepatic bile ducts containing stones; however, the gallbladder was not clearly identified. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed dilated extrahepatic ducts and choledocholithiasis without gallbladder visualization. The stone extraction was performed with endoscopic sphincterotomy. Three-dimensional images using spiral-computed tomography after intravenous-infusion cholangiography clearly demonstrated an obstruction of the cystic duct. The patient was scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. At laparoscopy, the gallbladder fossa was not identified on the undersurface of the liver. Despite a thorough examination of the intrahepatic (left-sided within the lesser omentum), retroperitoneal, retrohepatic (within the falciform ligament), retroduodenal, and retropancreatic areas using laparoscopic ultrasonography, the gallbladder was not found. After careful dissection of the hepatoduodenal ligament, the dilated extrahepatic bile duct and a 1-cm length of hypoplastic cystic duct were found. Gallbladder agenesis is usually accompanied by the lack of the cystic duct. The present case is the third report of gallbladder agenesis with a patent or hypoplastic cystic duct."

Most of these complications present late after the original procedure, and many have clinical pictures that are not related to biliary etiology, which can confound and delay adequate management. Our patient presented with an intra-abdominal firm heterogeneous mass lesion. Imaging studies showed obvious abdominal wall invasion, and CA-125 level was elevated. Thus, malignancy could not be excluded. Final operative pathology revealed xanthogranulomatous inflammation. Complications of LC should be considered for patients with intra-abdominal abscess or mass lesion if there is a history of LC, regardless of time interval."

CD009323,0,16913309,0,Minimally invasive esophagectomy: early experience and outcomes.,"Minimally invasive esophageal surgery has the potential to improve mortality, hospital stay, and functional outcomes when compared with open methods. Although technically complex, combined laparoscopic and thoracoscopic esophageal resection is feasible. A case series of 20 patients who underwent minimally invasive total esophagectomy is presented. This study was a review of a prospective database. The purpose was to evaluate early results with laparoscopic total esophagectomy for benign and malignant disease. Between January 2003 and November 2005, 20 patients underwent minimally invasive esophageal surgery. All operations were performed by the same two surgeons. Age, gender, indications for surgery, pathologic stage, operative time, blood loss, transfusion requirements, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay, postoperative complications, and mortality were recorded. Diet progression, dysphagia, and need for stricture management were also recorded. Of the 20 minimally invasive total esophagectomies performed, 18 (90%) were completed successfully. The average age of the patients was 53 years. Indications for surgery were malignancy (n = 13), carcinoma in situ in the setting of Barrett's esophagus (n = 2), and benign stricture (n = 3). The average operating time was 467 minutes (range 346-580 min). Median blood loss was 350 mL (range 150-500 mL). The median intensive care unit stay was 2 days, and the median hospital length of stay was 12 days. Pathology revealed that 7 per cent of patients had stage I disease, 27 per cent of patients had stage II disease, and 53 per cent of patients had stage III disease. There was a single mortality (5%), a cervical leak in two patients (10%), a gastric tip necrosis in one patient (5%), and tracheoesophageal fistula in one patient (5%). Major complications occurred in eight patients (40%) and minor complications in nine (50%). Thirteen (72%) patients were discharged on enteral tube feeds to supplement caloric intake. The application of minimally invasive techniques in the arena of esophageal surgery continues to evolve. This approach has the potential to improve mortality, hospital stay, and other outcomes when compared with open methods. Although technically complex, laparoscopic total esophagectomy is feasible."

Malignancy is associated with 31% (43/137) of small bowel intussusception and 70% (74/106) of large bowel intussusception. Computerized tomography (CT) findings are pathognomonic for this condition. Often, the patient presents with long-standing, nonspecific complaints. A 63-year-old man presented with sudden onset of abdominal pain. CT demonstrated colonic inflammation. A laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for ileocecal intussusception was performed. The pathology report revealed a lipoma of the cecum. The postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged the fifth postoperative day. Despite a high incidence of malignancy, colonic or ileocecal intussusception can be successfully treated by laparoscopic resection. Review of the literature and treatment options are discussed."

In most cases of bowel injury during laparoscopy, the laparoscopic instruments that cause injury are the trocar, Veress needle, grasping forceps or scissors, electrocoagulator, or laser. We report a rare case of small bowel perforation after a thermal burn caused by contact with the end of the scope during laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. Burns and perforations of the small bowel during laparoscopy are rare complications preventable by familiarity with the physical properties of the laparoscopic instruments."
CD009323,0,16878513,0,Hydatid disease of the liver.,"Echinococcus granulosus remains a clinical problem in sheep and subsistence farming communities in South Africa. The most commonly affected organs are the liver and the lung. Most cysts remain clinically silent and are diagnosed incidentally or when complications occur. Clinical examination is unreliable in making the diagnosis. Serological testing has a broad range of sensitivity and specificity and is dependent on the purity of the antigens utilised. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen is gens utilised. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen is both sensitive and cost effective. Computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are reserved for complicated cases. The differential diagnosis includes any cystic lesion of the liver. Liver hydatid cysts can be treated by medical or minimally invasive (laparoscopic and percutaneous) means or by conventional open surgery. The most effective chemotherapeutic agents against the parasite are the benzimidazole carbamates, albendazole and mebendazole. Albendazole is more efficacious, but recommended treatment regimens differ widely in terms of timing, length of treatment and dose. Medical treatment alone is not an effective and durable treatment option. PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection, reaspiration) is the newest and most widely practised minimally invasive technique with encouraging results, but it requires considerable expertise. Open surgery remains the most accessible and widely practised method of treatment in South Africa. The options are either radical (pericystectomy and hepatic resection) or conservative (deroofing and management of the residual cavity). Various scolicidal agents are used intraoperatively (Eusol, hypertonic saline and others), although none have been tested in a formal randomised controlled trial. Laparoscopic surgery trials are small and unconvincing at present and should be limited to centres with expertise. Complicated cysts (intrabiliary rupture and secondary infection) may require ERCP to obtain biliary clearance before surgery, and referral to a specialist centre may be indicated."
CD009323,0,16873081,0,[Impact of surgical access on staging of early borderline and invasive tumors of the ovary].,"The objectives were to evaluate the impact of the surgical approach on the staging of borderline tumors and early-stage malignancies of the ovary. We retrospectively reviewed cases of borderline and invasive ovarian tumors stages Ia through Ic treated surgically between January 1, 1985 and December 31, 2001. We compared the rates of potentially harmful procedures according to the surgical approach. The quality of surgical staging was assessed by examining each required procedure and by determining a score. The influence of variables related to patient characteristics, preoperative workup, and initial surgery on staging quality was tested by univariate analysis. Variables independently associated with staging quality were entered in a logistic regression model. SPPS 7.5 and STATA 8 software was used for statistical tests. Of 118 patients with borderline tumors, 48 (41 %) underwent laparoscopic surgery, 54 (45 %) laparotomy, and 16 (14 %) laparoscopy converted to laparotomy. Surgery was conservative in 57 % of cases overall ; this proportion was significantly greater with laparoscopy than with laparotomy (p < 0.05) and in younger women (p < 0.001). Intraoperative tumor rupture occurred in 9 % of patients, with no significant difference across surgical approaches (p = 0.1). Bag extraction was used in 19 (40 %) of 48 laparoscopically treated patients. Staging was incomplete in 73 % of patients. By univariate analysis, bilateral adnexectomy and, to a lesser extent, age > 44 years, laparotomy, hysterectomy, and treatment after 1995 predicted at least partial staging. Factors independently associated with at least partial staging in the multivariate model were treatment after 1995, bilateral adnexectomy, and hysterectomy. Of 178 patients with invasive tumors, 34 underwent laparoscopic surgery, 114 laparotomy, and 30 conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy. The laparotomy group was characterized by significantly older patient age and larger tumors, compared to the laparoscopy group. Staging was often inadequate after initial surgery, most notably with low rates of paraaortic lymphadenectomy (0 % in the laparoscopy group, 18 % in the laparotomy group, and 33 % in the conversion group). Staging is often less complete with laparoscopy than with laparotomy. In patients with invasive cancer, inadequate initial staging is common, most notably when laparoscopy is used. The surgeons training seems of major importance."

CD009323,0,16830241,0,[Treatment and patient information in the context of uncertain diagnosis].,"An 82-year old female patient had an unclear gallbladder finding, and a laparoscopy was performed. The imaging techniques seemed to indicate gallbladder carcinoma infiltrating the liver. With the chosen method it was not possible to prove the actual existence of the cancer. The patient and her family were informed about the ""benign"" result and the patient was sent home. Three months later she died of gallbladder carcinoma, which was confirmed by liver aspiration during her last stay in hospital. The daughters were taken aback by the unexpected death of their mother. They declared that they would have spent the last three months differently, if they had been informed about the first suspected diagnosis and prognosis. Here we have a discussion about wasted chances. This article deals with the management of the fact that a diagnosed disease was ultimately fatal. It does not deal with the treatment of an advanced carcinoma of the gall-bladder with known lethal outcome. The approach can be twofold: a curative approach neglecting reality and patient communication on the one hand; a palliative approach with the goal of making the 'best' of the situation on the other. Regularly, after thorough clinical and technical examination we have evidence of cancer which we cannot actually prove by pathological confirmation. Very often these tumours are located in the pancreas and the biliary tract. When very old patients are concerned, decisions are even harder to take: how far are we to go with invasive examination methods and what will be the consequences after the existence of the cancer has been proven? What form should patient information take? In my opinion, all doctors are confronted with such situations almost daily."

Differentiation between hepatocellular icterus with intrahepatic obstruction and extrahepatic mechanical obstruction is of utmost importance. Differential diagnosis usually includes a combination of clinical examination, biochemical testing, ultrasonography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), transhepatic cholangiography, computed tomography (CT), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). Choledocholithiasis mostly develops due to concrement migration from the gallbladder. The treatment of choice is operative therapy by either conventional method with laparotomy or endoscopic concrement extraction, the latter being preferred in case of residual concrements. Malignant stenoses of extrahepatic ducts can involve any segment of the biliary ducts or the gallbladder. The main symptom is so-called painless icterus. The condition is treated surgically by radical (various types of resection) or palliative (biliodigestive anastomoses) methods. Intraoperative lesion occurring on biliary duct procedures is generally involved in the etiology of benign stenoses of extrahepatic biliary ducts.

If the bile duct injury is circumferential or the bile duct is transected, conversion to open surgery is usually done. With the continuing development of laparoscopic techniques, procedures that previously seemed implausible can now be performed laparoscopically. We describe a case of successful laparoscopic end-to-end choledochocholedochostomy after the common bile duct was mistaken for the cystic duct intraoperatively and transected."

Diagnosis, therapy, and course of a rare developmental anomaly of the pancreas].","Ectopic pancreas is a rare entity but the second most prevalent pancreatic anomaly. Heterotopic pancreas is defined as the presence of pancreatic tissue without any anatomic or vascular continuity with the main body of the pancreas. Its aetiology is not clearly established. In 1916, Poppi published for the first time evidence of heterotopic pancreas in the gallbladder. A review of the literature up to the present showed only 28 more cases worldwide of ectopic pancreas in the gallbladder. Aberrant pancreas is incidentally discovered in 2% of autopsies and has been estimated to occur once in every 500 upper abdominal explorations. Ninety per cent of ectopic pancreas is found in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum. Mostly it is asymptomatic and benign. For this reason, therapy is indicated only in patients with symptoms such as pyloric obstruction, bleeding, and malignant transformation. Surgical resection or endoscopic mucosal resection as a newer method are recommended."
CD009323,0,16773762,0,Laparoscopic strategies for resection of insulinomas.,"Sporadic insulinomas are suitable for the laparoscopic approach because they are solitary, resectable, and not metastatic. Laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography (LapUS) can identify lesions that are undetectable by preoperative imaging techniques. However, it is still worthwhile to attempt preoperative imaging by endoscopic ultrasonography to provide useful information for patient positioning and port placement. Laparoscopic pancreatic resection and laparoscopic enucleation are feasible and safe techniques. Conversion to the open approach should be considered for tumors that cannot be identified accurately by LapUS. In patients with insulinomas in the setting of multiple endocrine neoplasia 1, the laparoscopic approach is slightly different. Laparoscopic subtotal distal pancreatectomy preserving the spleen combined with laparoscopic enucleation of any tumors identified in the pancreatic head should be the standard operation. The advantages of laparoscopic pancreatic procedures should be those of all laparoscopic procedures, which obviously reduce the parietal damage in the abdomen. This may be associated with reductions in postoperative pain and hospital stay and an earlier return to previous activity. A cosmetic advantage is also clear because of the absence of long abdominal incision, and this should be taken into account, especially in young women."

In this case the laparoscopic or open closure of the gastroduodenal defect or local hemostasis of the bleeding ulcer by laparotomy are the main aims of surgery. Elective operations due to recurrent gastric or duodenal ulcers have become rare. An indication for gastric ulcer resistant to conservative therapy could be persisting suspicion of malignancy whereas in duodenal ulcer gastric outlet obstruction represents a reason for surgery. If these indications are confirmed the classic procedures of gastric resection like Billroth I and Billroth II are performed whereas vagotomy is no longer used. Altogether ulcer surgery has become very safe although it is practiced quite rarely."
CD009323,0,16755298,0,Short-term costs of conventional vs laparoscopic assisted surgery in patients with colorectal cancer (MRC CLASICC trial).,"The short-term clinical results of the CLASICC trial indicated that clinical outcomes were similar between laparoscopic and open approaches. This study presents the short-term (3 month) cost analysis undertaken on a subset of patients entered into the CLASICC trial (682 of 794 patients). As expected the costs associated with the operation were higher in the 452 patients randomised to laparoscopic surgery (lap) compared with the 230 randomised to open procedure (open), Pounds 1703 vs Pounds 1386. This was partially offset by the other hospital (nontheatre) costs, which were lower in the lap group (Pounds 2930 vs Pounds 3176). The average cost to individuals for reoperations was higher in the lap group (Pounds 762 vs Pounds 553). Overall costs were slightly higher in the lap group (Pounds 6899 vs Pounds 6631), with mean difference of Pounds 268 (95%CI -689 to 1457). Sensitivity analysis made little difference to these results. The cost of rectal surgery was higher than for colon, for lap (Pounds 8259 vs Pounds 5586) and open procedures (Pounds 7820 vs Pounds 5503). The short-term cost analysis for the CLASICC trial indicates that the costs of either laparoscopic or open procedure were similar, lap surgery costing marginally more on average than open surgery."
CD009323,0,16754123,0,A memory-shape temperature-dependent nickel-titanium device for colonic anastomosis in laparoscopic surgery.,"Minimally invasive surgery is a growing issue in medicine and is also increasingly being used for colonic surgery. With this procedure, the involved colon is dissected laparoscopically, exteriorized through a small incision and the segment containing the tumor is resected. The anastomosis is done extraperitoneally either by hand suture or with a stapler. Our study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of using a memory-shape compression anastomosis clip (CAC) to perform colonic anastomosis in laparoscopy. Ten patients who were scheduled for laparoscopic colonic surgery entered the study. In five patients, the anastomosis was performed with the CAC and in five patients, with a stapler. To perform anastomosis with CAC, the two edges of the resected colon are placed parallel. Two 5-mm incisions are made close to the edges, where the CAC is introduced in an open position after being cooled in ice water at 0 degrees C, using a special applier. The applier introduces the clip which clamps the two bowel loops together, creating a small incision through the clamped walls, and then releasing the clip inside the intestine. The two 5-mm incisions are then sutured. The clip is expelled with the stool within five to seven days after the operation, creating a perfect uniform anastomosis. Neither group had complications related to the anastomosis. Our study shows that the use of the CAC for colonic laparoscopic surgery is simple, very efficient and shortens operation time. It creates a uniform anastomosis, coming close to the no-touch concept in surgery, may prevent infection, and is low in cost compared to the stapler."
CD009323,0,16753995,0,Robotic-assisted laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy.,"Surgical laparoscopic robotic systems have been developed to transfer time-consuming, repetitive tasks from human to robot, thus increasing safety and improving surgical outcome. Laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy for unresectable pancreatic cancer has become widely accepted. The main manipulation of this operation is suturing, which could possibly be done with robotic assistance. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and the technical aspects of robotic-assisted laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy. Sixteen pigs were divided into two groups of eight. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy (Roux-Y anastomosis) was performed in one group of animals (Group RLC). The second group was used as control and underwent a laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy using the ordinary laparoscopic instruments, except with robotic camera control (Group LC). Laparotomy and fluoroscopic examination were performed postoperatively. Animals in both groups tolerated the operations well. There was no significant difference in set-up time between groups. The operative time and the time for completing the two anastomoses were significantly longer in the RLC group. There was no leakage after anastomoses in any animal, as confirmed by laparotomy and fluoroscopy. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy is technically feasible. Stable images and comfortable manipulation can be obtained using this technique. One or two surgeons can perform this operation, assisted by the robotic system. The main disadvantages are longer operative time and the use of expensive devices. With improvements in robotic instruments and techniques, the operative time will be decreased and the technology could become widely accepted."

CD009323,0,16753101,0,[What are the main errors made by surgeons in the management of pancreatic cancer?].,"The present review identifies two major conceptual errors. Therapeutic nihilism, which should be discounted in view of the results currently achieved by surgery, and noncentralization, since better results have been demonstrated, both in terms of morbidity and mortality and in survival, in high-volume centers than in low volume centers. The present review also identifies errors in management, the most important of which are: undervaluing the medical record, which is of great utility and continues to be the pillar on which the entire diagnostic process is based; the systematic use of preoperative biliary drainage, which used to be considered mandatory but should be used highly selectively in patients with severe jaundice or biliary tract infections, and viewing preoperative imaging tests as unreliable, when current radiological techniques, particularly helical computed tomography (CT), are highly reliable in establishing tumor resectability and consequently they should be used in all treatment planning. Moreover, because radiological tests are highly reliable, laparoscopic staging has lost diagnostic value; obtaining a preoperative histological diagnosis, which is not mandatory except when neoadjuvant therapy is planned or when tumors requiring nonsurgical treatment are suspected; undervaluing the use of surgical palliation, since this technique provides better long-term results than nonsurgical palliation, and consequently still plays a role in patients with good general health status and prolonged life expectancy; systematically performing gastrojejunostomy with bilio-enteric bypass, as this procedure should only be performed in tumors of the uncus or when there is imminent biliary or gastroduodenal obstruction; the use of supraradical surgical techniques such as regional, total or extensive pancreatectomy, since these techniques do not prolong survival after resection. Furthermore, the use of vascular resections would only be justified if resection with disease-free margins could be performed; undervaluing close postoperative monitoring within specialized units since this is the key to reducing morbidity and mortality rates in this type of surgery; and lastly when an intraoperative pancreatic incidentaloma is present, performing diagnostic maneuvers such as biopsy or pancreatic mobilization, since these procedures hamper subsequent radiological interpretation and possible surgical intervention."

CD009323,0,16557419,0,Pancreatic cancer: surgery alone is not sufficient.,"For a patient with resected pancreatic cancer at the head of the pancreas, the goal of the medical community in the new millennium is a long-term survival rate exceeding 50% at 5 years. This goal can best be achieved with the following formula: accurate staging by improved imaging that includes laparoscopy for selected patients with locally extensive disease using computed tomography; a balanced resection, not too extensive and not too limited; centralized treatment in high-volume centers, which includes not just the surgeons and hospitals, but also the chemotherapy infusion units; and use of an effective adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment in which toxicity is associated with efficacy. The ideal outcome for the surgeon is delivery of a patient who has been accurately staged to receive the most appropriate treatment in a timely fashion for an effective chemoradiotherapy protocol. To do this, the surgeon should use objective benchmarks of safe pancreatic resection, which involves resecting only enough, achieving low blood loss, and achieving a minimal length of hospital stay. The outcome is a patient who has optimized his or her gastrointestinal, endocrine, and exocrine functions and is ready for adjuvant treatment 6 weeks after resection.

CD009323,0,16549326,0,Evidence-based diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer.,"Only 20% of patients who present with pancreatic cancer will be amenable to potentially curative resection. Therefore, it is necessary to reliably identify patients who might benefit from major surgical intervention by employing the appropriate staging methods. In this review, the pros and cons of each imaging technique are discussed and an algorithm for single and combined use of the different imaging modalities is proposed. To date, contrast-enhanced multi-detector row helical CT (MDR-CT) together with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) remain the first staging methods of choice. MDR-CT has a high sensitivity for identifying vascular invasion and EUS is able to detect lesions as small as 2-3 mm. ERCP is performed mainly in patients with biliary obstruction with the option for therapeutic intervention during the same session. MRI with MR-angiography, MRCP, PET/CT and staging laparoscopy are additional modalities which might give further information in cases of equivocal findings by MDR-CT and EUS. The role of tumour markers such as CA 19-9 and CEA is reserved for monitoring and diagnosing post-surgery recurrence. Cytological or histological confirmation should usually be performed in patients that are not eligible for surgery prior to the commencement of palliative radio- or chemotherapy.

With this procedure, disorders in the gallbladder can be examined in detail, using, for example, selective cytology, and drainage for acute cholecytitis can also be performed. With this procedure, we were able to successfully perform early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Although surgery is often problematic in patients with acute cholecystitis because of inflammation, making Callot's triangle difficult to distinguish, the use of endoscopic naso-gallbladder drainage (ENGBD) during surgery enables us to identify the cystic duct for catheter cannulation. We performed early LC for acute cholecystitis in 18 of 22 patients, while 18 other patients underwent open cholecystectomy during the same period (retrospective study). These two groups were then compared. The LC group had shorter pre- and postoperative periods and shorter hospitalization (P < 0.05). ENGBD resulted in very little bleeding. None of the ENGBD patients required conversion to open surgery, whereas 11.1% of the non-ENGBD patients were converted. ENGBD was successfully employed in 18 of the initial 22 (81.8%) patients. The favorable points in using ENGBD with LC were that (i) the gallbladder inflammation was alleviated even if patients had ascites, and (ii) use of ENGBD normally improved visualization and made cystic duct identification easier. However, if ERCP cannot be carried out, the performance of ENGBD must also be ruled out."
CD009323,0,16544067,0,Laparoscopic transcystic duct common bile duct exploration.,"The modern era of common bile duct (CBD) surgery started with Mirizzi, who introduced intraoperative cholangiography in 1932. Intraoperative choledoscopy had been developed as an adjunctive to intraoperative cholangiography, which helped to detect CBD stones in an additional 10% to 15% of instances that otherwise would have been missed. Findings have shown choledochoscopy to be an important technique for efficient and effective management of CBD stones. Efforts to treat patients with common duct stones in one session and to avoid the potential complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy resulted in several laparoscopic transcystic CBD (LTCBDE) techniques. The techniques of transcystic stone extraction include lavage, trolling with wire baskets or biliary balloon catheters, cystic duct dilation, biliary endoscopy, and stone retrieval with wire baskets under direct vision and antegrade sphincterotomy, lithotripsy, and catheter techniques. The indications for LTCBDE are filling or equivocal defects at cholangiography, stones smaller than 10 mm, fewer than 9 stones, and possible tumor. The contraindications are stones larger than 1 cm, stones proximal to the cystic duct entrance into the CBD, small friable cystic duct, and 10 or more stones. Experience with LTCBDE shows that the approach is applicable in more than 85% of cases, with a success rate of 85% to 95%. It also is shown to be more cost effective than postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Recent developments in LTCBDE have focused mainly on implementation of robotically assisted surgery and new imaging methods such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography with three-dimensional virtual cholangioscopy and three-dimensional ultrasound. Further technological advances will facilitate the application of laparoscopic approaches to the common duct, which should become the primary strategy for the great majority of patients."
CD009323,0,16533476,0,Minimally invasive pancreatic surgery: the new frontier?,"Recent advances in minimally invasive pancreatic surgery encompass laparoscopic, retroperitoneoscopic, endoscopic, thoracoscopic, and percutaneous approaches. Applications of endoscopic pancreatic surgery include laparoscopic resection, necrosectomy, drainage of pseudocysts, gastric and biliary bypass, and thoracoscopic splanchnotomy. This review provides an update on laparoscopic pancreatic resections. Over 400 cases of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) and enucleation (LEn) have been reported in the English literature, largely for benign disease. LDP and LEn have been associated with reductions in blood loss, morbidity, and hospital stay and a greater rate of splenic preservation compared with open surgery. Laparoscopic ultrasound is essential for intraoperative localization of insulinomas because failure of localization is the most common cause for conversion to laparotomy. The role of LDP with en bloc splenectomy and laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) for malignancy remains controversial. The majority of LPDs have been performed for malignancy. The short-term results of the limited world experience of 34 reported LPDs appear favorable."

We performed an explorative laparoscopy in 15 women presenting with advanced ovarian carcinoma, and for whom the preoperative evaluation was considered unsatisfactory, to define the possibility of achieving a complete cytoreduction. We focused on three sites of carcinomatosis: bowel, liver pedicle, and right diaphragmatic dome. Laparoscopic evaluation was successful in all 15 patients. Four patients were considered to have unresectable carcinomatosis because of extensive involvement of the small bowel and therefore had no laparotomy. These women underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the following 2 weeks. Eleven patients were considered to have resectable peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). Ten women had no macroscopic residual tumor after surgery. A modified posterior exenteration was performed in five patients. The laparoscopic exploration had underestimated the liver pedicle involvement in two patients, but only one had an infracentimetric residual tumor after surgery. Laparoscopy is a reliable method of exploring PC in advanced-stage ovarian cancer. Laparoscopy may obviate the need for unnecessary laparotomy in many cases and may, therefore, contribute to a better quality of life for patients found to have unresectable disease."
CD009323,0,16511580,0,[Laparoscopic biliary surgery].,"The following article briefly sets out the possible new protocols that can be applied in biliary pathology, arising from the changes brought about by the appearance of new techniques of laparoscopic biliary surgery. It offers a synthesis of the latest and most novel articles on surgical technique and management in different biliary pathologies such as choledocholithiasis and cholecystitis. It can be concluded that management will differ greatly, depending on the technical capacities of the centre that is called upon to deal with one of these pathologies. A standard protocol for everybody cannot thus be established at present. The differences between endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and intraoperative laparoscopic cholangiography have still to be demonstrated, it is not possible to make generalisations about whether one technique is more useful than the other. The same could be said about whether access to the main biliary path should be achieved through the cystic conduct or whether, on the contrary, a choledochotomy should be performed."
CD009323,0,16511579,0,[Hepatic and pancreatic laparoscopic surgery].,"The development of laparoscopic surgery also includes the more complex procedures of abdominal surgery such as those that affect the liver and the pancreas. From diagnostic laparoscopy, accompanied by laparoscopic echography, to major hepatic or pancreatic resections, the laparoscopic approach has spread and today encompasses practically all of the surgical procedures in hepatopancreatic pathology. Without forgetting that the aim of minimally invasive surgery is not a better aesthetic result but the reduction of postoperative complications, it is undeniable that the laparoscopic approach has brought great benefits for the patient in every type of surgery except, for the time being, in the case of big resections such as left or right hepatectomy or resections of segments VII and VIII. Pancreatic surgery has undergone a great development with laparoscopy, especially in the field of distal pancreatectomy due to cystic and neuroendocrine tumours where the approach of choice is laparoscopic. Laparoscopy similarly plays an important role, together with echolaparoscopy, in staging pancreatic tumours, prior to open surgery or for indicating suitable treatment. In coming years, it is to be hoped that it will continue to undergo an exponential development and, together with the advances in robotics, it will be possible to witness a greater impact of the laparoscopic approach on the field of hepatic and pancreatic surgery."

CD009323,0,16504710,0,Patient with liver epithelioid hemangioendothelioma treated by transplantation: 3 years' observation.,"Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a rare neoplasm of vascular origin, but unknown etiology that occurs in the liver, lungs and other organs. Its hepatic form (HEHE) generally behaves as a low-grade malignant tumor with a slowly progressive phenotype. Surgical resection or liver transplantation (OLT) has been recommended after diagnosis. We present a 30-year-old woman with primary HEHE of the liver treated by OLT in 2002. Her medical history started 3 years prior when an abdominal ultrasound examination revealed multiple focal changes in the liver. The histopathological diagnosis from a needle biopsy was carcinoma cholangiogenes desmoplasticum. For 2 years the patient was treated with chemotherapy combinations. To explain the lack of efficacy of chemotherapy, a laparoscopic biopsy was performed and HEHE diagnosed. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining for the factor VIII-related antigens, CD34 and CD31, which have been previously described as HEHE markers. The patient underwent OLT in March 2002. In the first month after OLT, the thyroid stimulating hormone concentration was elevated but they continuously decreased from 11.4 to 2.4 uIU/mL in May 2002 and thereafter remains normal. After 3 years observation the patient presented with good liver function and no signs of tumor recurrence. We concluded that immunohistochemical staining for characteristic endothelial cell markers may facilitate the correct diagnosis of HEHE. After diagnosis, OLT followed by immunosuppressive therapy, consisting of basiliximab, corticoids, low doses of tacrolimus and temporary administration of rapamycin, may be safe and effective. Monitoring of thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations should be performed in patients with HEHE."

All patients were staged with preoperative endoscopic ultrasound and received vaccinations for possible splenectomy. The indications for surgery were as follows: neuroendocrine tumor (n = 7), unspecified tumor (n = 1), and cystic neoplasm (n = 3). All procedures began with diagnostic laparoscopy and intraoperative ultrasound. Three patients underwent laparoscopic enucleation of a discrete pancreatic nodule. In eight patients, LDP was attempted. One patient required conversion to an open procedure. In the other seven patients, the procedure was completed laparoscopically, two with hand-assist. The average operative time was 5 hours and 3 minutes; average length of stay was 5 days; and the splenectomy rate was 57 per cent (n = 4). There was one complication of an infected hematoma. There were no pancreatic leaks, deaths, nor readmissions. LDP with or without splenectomy is feasible and can be performed with minimum morbidity and only slightly increased operative time."

Sixty-three patients suspected of having pancreatic disease underwent MRI with a 1.5-T device. After the acquisition of axial and coronal T2-weighted sequences, the MR protocol included T1-weighted fat-suppressed breath-hold SPGR images obtained before and 30 min after the infusion of Mn-DPDP (Teslascan). The detection of a focal pancreatic lesion and its intensity were evaluated in consensus by two observers, who also attempted to characterize each lesion as benign or malignant. The reviewers were blinded to patient identification and all clinical, laboratory and previous imaging findings. MR imaging results were correlated with surgery (n=37), laparoscopy (n=1), biopsy (n=2) and imaging follow-up (n=22). Sixty-two subjects were effectively included in our analysis because one patient was lost to follow-up; final malignant and benign diagnoses were determined in 22 (35%) and 29 (47%) of the patients, respectively. The level of confidence in the diagnosis of the pancreatic lesion was significantly increased by the administration of Mn-DPDP as demonstrated by ROC analysis of unenhanced and post-contrast image sets (P=0.009). Overall, on the basis of observers' readings, MR assessment of pancreatic disease resulted in 57 correct diagnoses (accuracy, 92%) and five (8%) incorrect diagnoses. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the reviewers for the detection of pancreatic lesions and for the differentiation between benign and malignant masses were 91% (95% CI: 84 and 98%), 93% (95% CI: 86 and 99%), 87% (95% CI: 79 and 95%) and 95% (95% CI: 89 and 100%), respectively.

For this reason port-sites excision is an essential surgical step during the second operation, which includes liver resection (segments 4b and 5) and lymph node dissection (hepatic pedicle and retroduodeno-pancreatic region). In this article we describe a simple technique to obtain a radical port-site excision with the aim to standardize this surgical step and to perform it in a radical way. Port-sites excision is the accurate and complete excision of the parietal channel created by the trocar during the previous cholecystectomy. This channel is often Z-shaped. In the second operation, the presence of peritoneal adhesions helps to identify exactly the previous site of entry of the trocar in the peritoneal cavity. Trocar reinsertion through the abdominal wall along the correctly identified original path allows the excision of a perfect cylinder of abdominal wall including all of the layers from the skin to the peritoneum."

Fifteen patients underwent laparoscopic resection, whereas 41 underwent an open resection. The 15 laparoscopic patients were matched to 15 open patients for age, gender, and pancreatic pathology. Data gathered included length of stay, pancreatic leak, postoperative complications, and return to normal activity. Of the 15 laparoscopic patients, three were converted to open operations. Laparoscopic patients had a median length of stay of 5 days (range, 3-9) compared with 8 days (range, 6-23) for the open patients (P = 0.02). The pancreatic leak rate was 13% in each group. Overall postoperative complication rate was 20% in the laparoscopic group compared with 27% in the open group. Laparoscopic patients reported a return to normal activity in 3 weeks (range, 2-7) compared with 6 weeks (range, 4-10) for open patients (P = 0.03).

CD009323,0,16365817,0,Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery.,"In the past, in the pancreas, a minimally invasive technique was only used for diagnostic laparoscopy in evaluating periampullary malignancy. Recent advances in operative techniques and instrumentation have empowered surgeons to perform virtually all procedures in the pancreas, including the Whipple procedure. Some of these procedures represent the most sophisticated application of minimally invasive surgery, and their outcomes are reportedly better than those of conventional open approaches. In addition to the evaluation of resectability in periampullary malignancy, palliative procedures, including biliary bypasses and gastrojejunostomy, can be performed laparoscopically. Although it is reportedly feasible to perform a Whipple procedure laparescopically, no benefit of the laparoscopic approach over the conventional open approach has been documented. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, with or without preserving the spleen, is technically easier than the Whipple procedure, and is more widely accepted. Indications for laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy include cystic neoplasms and islet-cell tumors located in the pancreatic body or tail. Complications of acute and chronic pancreatitis may be treated with the use of surgical laparoscopy. When infected necrotizing pancreatitis is identified, surgical intervention for drainage and debridement is required. According to the type and location of infected necrotizing pancreatitis, three laparoscopic operative approaches have been reported: infracolic debridement, retroperitoneal debridement, and laparoscopic transgastric pancreatic necrosectomy. When internal drainage is indicated for a pseudocyst, a minimally invasive technique is a promising option. Laparoscopic pseudocyst gastrostomy, cyst jejunostomy, or cyst duodenostomy can be performed, depending on the size and location of the pseudocyst. Especially when a pseudocyst is located in close contact with the posterior wall of the stomach, it is best drained by a pseudocyst gastrostomy, which can also be done with the use of an intragastric operative technique."
CD009323,0,16363014,0,Randomized clinical trial comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for colorectal cancer within an enhanced recovery programme.,Laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer may improve short-term outcome without compromising long-term survival or disease control.

CD009323,0,16334930,0,[Laparoscopic management of an infected oesophageal cyst].,"Oesophageal cysts are rare congenital anomalies. Most commonly, they are located in the posterior mediastinum, approximately at the level of the distal third of the oesophagus. In most cases, they are diagnosed during childhood as an accidental finding of a symptomatic mediastinal lesion. A CT or MRI, oesophagoscopy and endosonography of the oesophagus are the essential diagnostic methods. In the adulthood, most of the cysts cause problems pushing against the surrounding organs and, therefore, surgical removal is recommended. In this report, a case of a potential complication is described: infection of the oesophageal cyst of the distal part of the oesophagus following a transoesophageal punction. The case resulted in sepsis, which was managed laparoscopically. Entering through the diaphragmatic hiatus,a cyst in the posterior mediastinum was revealed. The cyst was partially resected and its content evacuated. No complications followed. The laparoscopic method is feasible and safe even if the oesophageal cysts are infected. A complete resection of the cyst would be complicated due to a possibility of injuring the oesophagus. A significance of the peroperative oesophagoscopy to verify the oesophagus position in an unclear anatomic situation due to inflammatory infiltration, is highlighted. The above decreases the risk of the oesophageal wall lesion."

Both laparoscopic staging and treatment of pancreatic cancer have proved feasible and effective. This paper reviews the literature on this topic, by a Medline search using the words laparoscopy and pancreas. Various aspects are considered: staging, treatment and palliation. Cross-references from the articles retrieved were reviewed. The efficacy and safety of diagnostic laparoscopy and ultrasonography, lowering the rate of useless laparotomies, is evident in most studies. Moreover laparoscopic resection of the body and tail of the pancreas, as well as palliation of digestive obstruction has been demonstrated as feasible. Controversy exists on feasibility of pancreatoduodenectomy. Laparoscopic gastric outlet obstruction bypass and laparoscopic biliary decompression have been reported with good results compared to open surgical procedures. Randomized controlled trials are required to validate promising results coming from the reported series, mainly retrospective."

CD009323,0,16334112,0,Congenital anomalies of the spleen mimicking hematological disorders and solid tumors: a single-center experience of 2650 consecutive diagnostic laparoscopies.,"Congenital anomalies of the spleen range from splenic lobulation, to accessory spleen to polysplenia. Though most of these anatomical variants have no clinical significance, an accessory spleen may simulate a tumor in the adrenal gland, pancreas, stomach or intestine. Alternatively, a missed accessory spleen may be the site of the relapse of a hematological disorder. We, therefore, assessed retrospectively: (i) the frequency of congenital anomalies of the spleen observed during 2650 consecutive laparoscopies and (ii) looked for possible misdiagnoses of the accessory spleen as hematological disorders or solid tumors located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Congenital anomalies of the spleen were detected in 55 cases, accounting for 2.07%. Accessory spleens were observed in 44 patients (1.6%) and spleen lobulation in 11 (0.47%). An accessory spleen was the most common of the splenic anomalies. Among the 44 patients in whom an accessory spleen was discovered laparoscopically, the recognition of this anomaly prevented a relapse of a hematological disease in one case and avoided a useless exploratory laparotomy in the second, where the radiologist had interpreted this malformation as a space-occupying lesion. In the third case, the accessory spleen was initially misdiagnosed as a solid tumor of the pancreas, but was eventually recognized as a congenital anomaly by a second laparoscopy."
CD009323,0,16333629,0,Laparoscopic management of pediatric choledochal cysts in developing countries: review of ten cases.,"We report laparoscopic management of choledochal cysts (CDC) in 10 children. We dissect the CDC using conventional mono- and bi-polar diathermy up to the lower end, ligate or clip it at the lowest possible level and divide it. The proximal end is divided after leaving a sufficient cuff for anastomosis. In the first three cases, we formally opened to complete the biliary-enteric anastomosis. However, in the subsequent seven cases, we made a small midline incision to develop a Roux-en Y loop, and the anastomosis was then completed by intra-corporeal suturing after re-creating the pneumo-peritoneum. Apart from biliary leak in one case, we did not encounter any major complications. The mean operative time was 4.2 h. We have discussed the technical points in the study. We conclude that CDC is eminently suitable for laparoscopic correction; it requires advanced skills and expertise for precise dissection and meticulous suturing in restricted spaces. If the case selection is good and if the team is experienced, CDC can be effectively managed using laparoscopy even without a sophisticated equipment. The wound- and scar-related morbidity is minimized."

CD009323,0,16332496,0,Indications for selective intraoperative cholangiography.,"The indications for selective intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) include a clinical history of jaundice, pancreatitis, elevated bilirubin level, abnormal liver function test results, increased amylase levels, a high lipase level, or dilated common bile duct on preoperative ultrasonography. Although these clinical features are widely accepted as indications for IOC, they have not been tested for their ability to predict choledocholithiasis. Charts were reviewed for a 6-month time period in 2003 at Parkland Memorial Hospital for all patients undergoing cholecystectomy. Univariate analysis and logistic regression were used to determine which factors predicted choledocholithiasis. Of the 572 patients undergoing cholecystectomies during the study period, 189 underwent IOC and common bile duct stones were found in 57. Only preoperative hyperbilirubinemia or ultrasonograph identification of common bile duct dilation reliably predicted choledocholithiasis. There were 13 cases of choledocholithiasis that would not have been identified by preoperative hyperbilirubinemia or an enlarged common bile duct. However, common bile duct stones were clinically significant in only 2 of the 13 cases. One of these was treated with postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and the other was treated with laparoscopic common bile duct exploration. Preoperative identification of a dilated common bile duct or elevated bilirubin levels can be the sole criteria for performing IOC on a selective basis in patients without malignancy. Reliance on a history of remote jaundice, pancreatitis, elevated liver function test values, or pancreatic enzymes results in unnecessary IOCs."
CD009323,0,16332484,1,CA 19-9 levels predict results of staging laparoscopy in pancreatic cancer.,"Laparoscopy has emerged as an important staging procedure for determining resectability of pancreatic cancer. However, a small fraction of patients with pancreatic cancer benefit from its use and therefore the routine application of laparoscopy remains controversial. We hypothesized that serum CA 19-9 levels may identify patients who will or will not benefit by laparoscopy. We retrospectively reviewed our database of 63 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent staging laparoscopy and correlated findings with CA 19-9 levels. Overall, laparoscopy identified metastatic disease in 12 patients (19%). None of those required any further operation. The resectability rate (patients who underwent resection after laparoscopy) was 73.5%. There was one false-negative laparoscopy (1.6%). Patients with higher CA 19-9 levels had significant higher odds of having metastasis identified by laparoscopy (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.24; P = .04). There was no patient with CA 19-9 levels below 100 U/ml in whom metastatic disease was identified during laparoscopy: 18 patients (28.6%) with CA 19-9 levels below this cutoff point had negative laparoscopy and could have avoided the procedure had this cutoff been used for screening. This would have increased the laparoscopy yield to 26.7%. In patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, low CA 19-9 levels predict low probability of metastatic disease; in those patients, laparoscopy can be spared. On the contrary, patients with elevated CA 19-9 have an increased probability of metastatic disease, and these patients may benefit from diagnostic laparoscopy."

So we can perform RFA treatment successfully and safely by a choice of an appropriate echo probe."
CD009323,0,16311852,0,"Results of surgical, laparoscopic, and percutaneous treatment for hydatid disease of the liver: 10 years experience with 355 patients.","Selection of the most appropriate treatment to obtain the best results with the lowest rate of recurrence and minimal morbidity and mortality is mandatory for the management of hepatic hydatid disease. The surgical approach is the mainstay of treatment, and there has been a tendency toward laparoscopic surgery and, more recently, percutaneous treatment (PT), which has become increasingly popular with revolutions in techniques. We aimed to evaluate the results of current therapeutic methods in the context of a 10-year single-institution experience. Between 1992 and 2003, 355 patients with 510 hydatid cysts of the liver were treated by open operation, laparoscopic surgery, or PT. The series included 128 females and 227 males ranging in age from 10 years to 73 years. Preferred treatment modalities, perioperative complications, interventions, recurrences, and length of hospital stay were retrospectively analyzed. There were two postoperative deaths (1.08%) in the open surgery group. Biliary leakage was observed in 28 patients treated with open surgery, in 10 patients after PT, and in 2 after laparoscopic treatment. Recurrence rates were 16.2%, 3.3%, and 3.5% after open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, and percutaneous treatment, respectively. Characteristics of the cyst, presence of cystobiliary communications, and the availability of a multidisciplinary team are the factors that we believe directly affect the results. Radical surgery can be done safely for suitable cases; conventional procedures are associated with greater morbidity. Laparoscopic surgery seems effective and safe, with low morbidity and recurrence rates for type I-III cysts in accessible localizations. Our experience with PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection, and reaspiration) and catheterization provides evidence that the procedure is an effective and safe option."

CD009323,0,16294161,0,[Cystic diseases of the liver and biliary tract (except for hydatid cyst). Role of surgery].,"The role of surgery in cystic diseases of the liver and biliary tract depends upon the kind of cysts. When they are symptomatic, solitary cysts of the liver may require laparoscopic unroofing. Mucinous cystadenoma should be resected since there is a risk of cystadenocarcinoma. Polycystic liver disease may require surgery when massive hepatomegaly results in pain or a worsening of the patient's general condition. Laparoscopic fenestration and partial hepatectomy are only indicated in a small number of selected patients with large or localized cysts. Orthotopic liver transplantation may be recommended in symptomatic cases with massive hepatomegaly even if there is no renal failure and no need for renal transplantation. Caroli's syndrome localized in one lobe or one segment should be resected since it leads to cholangiocarcinoma in more than 10% of cases. When cystic dilatations are diffuse, liver transplantation may be required. Choledochal cysts should be completely resected since cancer may arise in non resected parts. Complete resection may be associated with major hepatectomy."
CD009323,0,16286705,1,Value of laparoscopy in the staging of pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease that swiftly robs patients of both quality and quantity of life. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. In 2003, there were 31,860 reported new cases with 31,270 deaths occurring due to lack of effective therapy. Eighty percent of patients present with either advanced local or metastatic disease. Dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) has become the current staging test of choice. Laparoscopic staging of pancreatic tumors with the addition of ultrasound can reveal intraparenchymal hepatic metastases, small peritoneal metastases, and critical retroperitoneal tumor-vessel relationships approaching the accuracy of open exploration to determine resectability without significantly increasing morbidity or mortality. However, given the current accuracy of high-quality CT, the routine use of diagnostic laparoscopy in pancreatic cancer is not warranted. Diagnostic laparoscopy is recommended in select patients with primary tumors greater than 4 cm, tumors in the body or tail of the pancreas, patients with equivocal findings of metastasis on CT, ascites, or clinical or laboratory findings suggesting advanced disease such as marked weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated CA 19-9."

CD009323,0,16257126,0,Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas; what a clinician should know.,"Primary cystic neoplasms of the pancreas (serous cystic neoplasms, mucinous serous neoplasms, and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms) are lesions of emerging importance. With the wide availability of modern imaging methods, these neoplasms are being recognized with increasing frequency. Due to the improvement of these sophisticated imaging techniques, it is often possible to differentiate preoperatively these primary pancreatic cystic neoplasms not only from other cystic pancreatic disorders (such as pancreatic pseudocysts) but also from one another. This differentiation is very important for the clinician, since these neoplasms have radically different biologic behavior. Serous cystic neoplasms are uniformly benign and usually do not mandate resection unless the lesion is symptomatic. In contrast, mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have a premalignant or overtly malignant tendency, and therefore should be managed aggressively by pancreatic resection. In these mucinous cystic neoplasms, recognition of an underlying malignancy is often not possible without a detailed histopathologic examination of the entire resected specimen. In the absence of invasive disease, prognosis is excellent after appropriate surgery. The presence of invasive malignancy signifies a poor prognosis."

Recognition of the key neuroglycopenic symptoms should trigger the initial investigation. Biochemical proof of endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia establishes the diagnosis. Several options are available for imaging and localizing these tumours including ultrasonography, computed tomography, and intra-arterial calcium stimulation with venous sampling. The tumours are usually small, single, benign, well-circumscribed, and evenly distributed throughout the pancreas. This tumour may be a part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) syndrome, in which case the tumours are almost always multiple. Surgical treatment is the only curative method, traditionally accomplished with enucleation or partial pancreatic resection. Patients are almost invariably cured lifelong with complete excision of a benign insulinoma. The most recent developments in this area are the recognition of noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome as a cause of organic hypoglycemia, and the development of laparoscopic techniques to excise these tumours."

The lesion, located in the duodenal wall, was diagnosed in a child with a history of cervical neuroblastoma that was in remission after surgical resection and chemotherapy. The diagnosis was obtained by examination of a biopsy specimen taken during laparoscopy. The decision was made to perform surgical resection. Examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis of PEComa. No metastasis was found. After 2 years of follow-up, the patient is alive, without evidence of metastasis or recurrence. This case highlights the distinctive characteristics of the cells in PEComa, recognizable even on limited biopsy material. It also suggests a possible association between PEComa and neuroblastoma, 2 unusual tumors that belong to the spectrum of lesions known to occur in patients with tuberous sclerosis and that may share a possible common pathogenetic mechanism."

The role of the minimally invasive surgical procedure in the staging of pancreatic malignancies appears to be one of selective use in patients at high risk of occult metastatic disease based on high-resolution CT imaging and clinical presentation. These patients can be spared the morbidity of a nontherapeutic laparotomy. Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery is an advanced laparoscopic procedure with a significant learning curve. It should be considered only by surgeons with extensive experience in open pancreatic surgery who possess advanced laparoscopic skills. Early reports suggest that laparoscopic pancreatic surgery can be accomplished with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates for the resection of small benign and low-grade malignant lesions in the body and tail of the pancreas, as well as for the internal drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts. Its role in the management of lesions in the head, neck, and uncinate process of the pancreas has yet to be determined."

In most cases the lesions are benign, solitary, and located within the pancreatic parenchyma. Because of these characteristics, the majority of these lesions can be treated with simple enucleation. Advances in laparoscopic techniques have recently enabled the safe resection of pancreatic islet cell tumors and may provide patients with the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. This video demonstrates the technique of laparoscopic enucleation of a pancreatic insulinoma. The case presentation is that of a 40-year-old man who had symptoms of neuroglycopenia and was found to have elevated proinsulin levels during a 72-hour fast. Further evaluation included a CT scan, which revealed a 1.5 cm lesion on the posterior surface of the midbody of the pancreas. The video shows the operative technique of enucleation of the lesion, including positioning and trocar placement, performance of intraoperative ultrasound for tumor localization, and the use of specialized instruments (laparoscopic freer-elevator with a spatulated tip) that allowed enucleation of the lesion without excess handling of the tumor itself. The operation was performed in 105 minutes with minimal blood loss. The patient was fed clear liquid diet on the day after surgery and was discharged home on the third postoperative day. He had an uneventful recovery and has experienced no further symptoms."
CD009323,0,16236756,0,The current role of staging laparoscopy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas: a review.,"In the absence of metastatic disease patients with localized or locally advanced pancreatic cancer can benefit from surgical resection or chemoradiation. Despite the advances of imaging technology, however, noninvasive staging modalities are still inaccurate in identifying small volume metastatic disease leading potentially to inappropriate treatment and avoidable morbidity in a subgroup of patients. Staging laparoscopy may identify those patients with unsuspected metastatic disease on preoperative imaging and prevent unnecessary laparotomy or chemoradiation. A controversy exists, however, as to whether the procedure should be used routinely or selectively in pancreatic cancer patients with no evidence of metastasis on noninvasive staging. This review aims to assess the current role of staging laparoscopy by examining its diagnostic accuracy and ability to prevent unnecessary treatment as well as its morbidity, oncologic effect and cost-effectiveness. The available literature will be evaluated critically, its limitations identified and exisiting controversies addressed."

This paper presents the technique and results of laparoscopic placement of feeding jejunostomy tubes in patients presenting with esophagogastric cancer. From December 2002 to February 2004, patients diagnosed with esophagogastric cancer with a potentially resectable lesion underwent staging laparoscopy. Laparoscopic feeding jejunostomy was performed on patients who were potential candidates for chemotherapy with palliative intent or neoadjuvant treatment prior to resection surgery. Surgical technique, recovery of bowel function, commencement of feeding jejunostomy, total time tube was in situ, and perioperative complications were analyzed. Of the 22 patients who underwent staging laparoscopy, a feeding jejunostomy tube was placed in 18. The remaining 4 patients were deemed to have advanced disease precluding any therapeutic options and underwent placement of esophageal stents. Feeding tubes remained in situ for a median time period of 76 days. Fourteen patients required enteral support and tubes were used for a median of 30 days. Complications from tube placement included 2 cases of wound infections, 1 of minor leak and 1 tube dislodgment. Patients were followed up for a median time of 112 days.

These lesions are seen more frequently in recent surgical practice, probably because of advances in diagnostic and surgical techniques. Total tumor resection provides the best chance of cure and may remove the risk of malignant transformation of the cystadenomas, particularly of the mucinous type. Minimally invasive techniques have been revolutionary and provide clinical evidence of decreased morbidity and comparable efficacy to traditional, open surgery. However, laparoscopic pancreatic resection is not an established treatment for tumors of the pancreas."
CD009323,0,16197529,0,Minimally invasive pharyngo-laryngo-esophagectomy: a salvage procedure for recurrent postcricoid esophageal cancer.,"Hypopharyngeal and cervical esophageal tumors represent 5-10% of all esophageal neoplasms and are challenging for both surgeons and oncologists, because the choice of the adequate therapeutic strategy is not clearly defined and therefore difficult. In fact, although surgical treatment represents the gold standard of therapy, chemo-radiotherapy, previously used as adjuvant treatment, has been more recently adopted with curative intent, leaving to surgery a salvage role only. When surgery is required it is advisable to reduce patients' trauma. The present study reports on a personal technique for minimally invasive pharyngo-laryngo-esophagectomy and reconstruction with the whole stomach. We use a laparoscopic approach for mobilization of the stomach, transhiatal esophageal dissection and to follow transhiatal gastric transposition to the neck combined to a cervicotomy to perform pharyngo-laryngectomy, proximal esophageal mobilization, and pharyngo-gastric anastomosis. We performed this technique on four patients with recurrent disease after initially curative primary chemo-radiotherapy. Mean operative time was 345 min (range: 300-384). There were no intraoperative complications. All patients were extubated immediately after the operation and were managed in postoperative care unit for a mean time of 10 days (range: 7-12). Enteral nutrition was begun on post-operative day (POD) 1. The nasogastric tube and drainages were removed on POD 11, and patients immediately started oral nutrition. One patient had a TIA (transient ischemic attack) on POD 2. All patients were discharged within 20 days (18-20). Initial experience with this minimally invasive technique in selected patients is encouraging because it seems to minimize postoperative complications and allows early rehabilitation."

CD009323,0,16183532,0,Endocrine tumours of the gastrointestinal tract. Transplantation in the management of metastatic endocrine tumours.,"Patients with neuroendocrine tumours often present with synchronous liver metastases or develop hepatic metastases in the course of their disease. A complete removal of liver metastases with an intention to cure may be accomplished by liver resection or, if hepatic disease is disseminated or hormonal symptoms and pain cannot be controlled medically, by total hepatectomy and transplantation. The indications for orthotopic liver transplantation for metastatic neuroendocrine tumour disease should be anchored in a multimodal and multidisciplinary therapeutic approach. Approximately, 120-130 cases of orthotopic liver transplantation for neuroendocrine tumours have been published so far, but follow-up after transplantation has been limited, and most reports comprise a small number of patients. After considering published studies and data, some recommendations may be given, although these are based on a low level of evidence. After excluding extrahepatic tumour manifestations by imaging procedures and diagnostic laparoscopy, the indication should be chosen restrictively. Few prognostic markers, for example age below 50 years and absence of concurrent extensive surgery, were identified by multivariate analysis in a large retrospective analysis. The prognostic impact of primary tumour localisation is still controversial. However, further indicators of favourable long-term prognosis are needed. Tumour biology characterised by Ki67 and E-cadherin expression may help to identify patients with a favourable outcome so that patient selection can be improved, but this needs further evaluation in larger patient cohorts. Orthotopic liver transplantation for patients with remission of disease or stable disease under medical treatment, and orthotopic liver transplantation for palliative reasons, should be restricted to selected individual cases."

Traditional surgical gastrostomy, percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy, and laparoscopic gastrostomy are the alternatives. The most common indication is neurogenic dysphagia followed by obstructive causes such as head and neck tumors. Ethically justified and clinically comprehensive guidelines should be followed during the decision-making process for PEG tube placement. A limited life expectancy; technical difficulties, such as the inability to bring the anterior gastric wall in apposition to the abdominal wall; or pharyngeal/esophageal obstruction, which compromise tube insertion, peritonitis, and uncorrectable coagulopathy are absolute contraindications. The ""pull method"" is the first described and still the most performed technique of PEG tube placement. The procedure is simple, safe, and effective and fulfills all requirements to provide an ideal route for nutritional support.

Our last patient, however, had a giant thoraco-abdominal duodenal duplication, extending from the upper thoracic cavity to the pelvis, in a dumbbell fashion. Forty days after birth, a combined ""thoraco-laparoscopy"" was performed, achieving a complete resection of the cyst. The diaphragmatic defect was repaired as well. Recovery was uneventful. Based on this successful experience, we think that the thoraco-laparoscopic approach is suitable and reproducible for patients with these infrequent malformations, and even for patients with other kinds of thoraco-abdominal lesions. The purpose of this report was to describe the minimally invasive strategy used to approach the thorax and the abdomen in a single-stage procedure."
CD009323,0,16138769,0,[Current diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer].,"Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (pancreatic cancer) is the most frequent tumor entity in the pancreas. While the results of surgical therapy of pancreatic cancer were disappointing in the past due to high perioperative mortality rates, resection of pancreatic cancer nowadays represents the standard treatment for non-metastatic cancer with a mortality rate below 5%. This decrease in perioperative mortality of the Whipple operation is inversely correlated to the case load of the hospital and the responsible surgeon, and is mainly related to improvements in the intensive care management, the surgical technique and patient selection. In particular, the perioperative use of octreotide resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of pancreatic fistula. Furthermore, modern staging examinations such as diagnostic laparoscopy, PET, or endoscopic ultrasound resulted in improved patient selection. In addition, the long-term results of the surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer has been improved by adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the past 10 years. Similar progress has been made in the palliative treatment of metastatic or locally advanced cancer. Nowadays, endoscopic procedures can replace surgical palliation of obstructive jaundice in most cases and sometimes even gastric outlet obstruction. Moreover, systemic chemotherapy using gemcitabine-based protocols has resulted in a significant prolongation of survival. However, further progress in the treatment of pancreatic cancer can only be achieved by an interdisciplinary management of this disease."

We report the successful laparoscopic application of this procedure in a 78-year-old man with duodenal obstruction. Computed tomography revealed a mass in the duodenum along with multiple masses in the liver. A radiological image showed an ulcerative tumour in the third portion of the duodenum occluding the lumen. He was diagnosed as having an unresectable duodenal cancer with multiple liver metastases. He needed palliative bypass surgery. Laparoscopically, the stomach was partially divided using an endoscopic autosuture device, and end-to-side GJ was performed successfully.

CD009323,0,16125619,1,"Computed tomography, endoscopic, laparoscopic, and intra-operative sonography for assessing resectability of pancreatic cancer.","Pancreas cancer is the fourth leading cancer killer in adults. Cure of pancreas cancer is dependent on the complete surgical removal of localized tumor. A complete surgical resection is dependent on accurate preoperative and intra-operative imaging of tumor and its relationship to vital structures. Imaging of pancreatic tumors preoperatively and intra-operatively is achieved by pancreatic protocol computed tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS), and intra-operative ultrasound (IOUS). Multi-detector CT with three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of images is the most useful preoperative modality to assess resectability. It has a sensitivity and specificity of 90 and 99%, respectively. It is not observer dependent. The images predict operative findings. EUS and LUS have sensitivities of 77 and 78%, respectively. They both have a very high specificity. Further, EUS has the ability to biopsy tumor and obtain a definitive tissue diagnosis. IOUS is a very sensitive (93%) method to assess tumor resectability during surgery. It adds little time and no morbidity to the operation. It greatly facilitates the intra-operative decision-making. In reality, each of these methods adds some information to help in determining the extent of tumor and the surgeon's ability to remove it. We rely on pancreatic protocol CT with 3-D reconstruction and either EUS or IOUS depending on the tumor location and operability of the tumor and patient. With these modern imaging modalities, it is now possible to avoid major operations that only determine an inoperable tumor. With proper preoperative selection, surgery is able to remove tumor in the majority of patients."

CD009323,0,16111100,0,Treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts.,"According to the Atlanta classification an acute pseudocyst is a collection of pancreatic juice enclosed by a wall of fibrous or granulation tissue, which arises as a consequence of acute pancreatitis or pancreatic trauma, whereas a chronic pseudocyst is a collection of pancreatic juice enclosed by a wall of fibrous or granulation tissue, which arises as a consequence of chronic pancreatitis and lack an antecedent episode of acute pancreatitis. It is generally agreed that acute and chronic pseudocysts have a different natural history, though many reports do not differentiate between pseudocysts that complicate acute pancreatitis and those that complicate chronic disease. Observation--""conservative treatment""--of a patient with a pseudocyst is preponderantly based on the knowledge that spontaneous resolution can occur. It must, however, be admitted that there is substantial risk of complications or even death; first of all due to bleeding. There are no randomized studies for the management protocols for pancreatic pseudocysts. Therefore, today we have to rely on best clinical practice, but still certain advice may be given. First of all it is important to differentiate acute from chronic pseudocysts for management, but at the same time not miss cystic neoplasias. Conservative treatment should always be considered the first option (pseudocysts should not be treated just because they are there). However, if intervention is needed, a procedure that is well known should always be considered first. The results of percutaneous or endoscopic drainage are probably more dependent on the experience of the interventionist than the choice of procedure and if surgery is needed, an intern anastomosis can hold sutures not until several weeks (if possible 6 weeks)."
CD009323,0,16110256,0,An evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer.,"Technology has revolutionized the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic malignancy. Previously, staging of disease was accomplished by exploratory laparotomy. Now, however, tumor size, lymph node and vascular involvement and the presence of metastases can be reliably assessed prior to operation using a widely available series of diagnostic tests, facilitating a preoperative assessment of tumor resectability. Appropriate use of these tests often spares patients with unresectable disease the need for operative intervention. As part of our staging algorithm we routinely employ a combination of clinical suspicion, a high-resolution helical CT scan and a serum CA 19-9 level. Endoscopic ultrasonography is useful in the patient in whom CT findings are equivocal, or in whom a tissue diagnosis is desired. Laparoscopy is reserved for patients with suspected advanced disease despite imaging findings to the contrary. Using this strategy, pancreatic malignancy may be diagnosed as expeditiously and as cost-effectively as is possible given current technology."

Despite extensive radiologic and endoscopic work-up, the origin of the bleeding could not be identified. At his last admission, visceral angiography revealed an area of hypervascularity at the initial portion of the jejunum, containing irregular, corkscrew vessels coming from the first jejunal branch of the superior mesenteric artery. Under general endotracheal anesthesia, a 10-mm trocar for the 30 degree laparoscope was inserted subumbilically using the open Hasson technique. Two 5-mm trocars were also used suprapubically and at the left iliac fossa. A 2.5 cm diameter, smooth, hypervascular tumor was easily visualized on the jejunal wall 10 cm from the ligament of Treitz. The small bowel segment was laparoscopically mobilized and brought through the subumbilical trocar site, which was extended 1 cm. A limited small bowel resection and a stapled anastomosis were easily performed extracorporeally. Histopathologic examination diagnosed a benign gastrointestinal tumor (gastrointestinal stromal tumor, leiomyoma). The patient was discharged on postoperative day 2.

In 111 (82.2%) patients only the liver was affected; 9 (6.7%) patients had concomitant hepatic and extrahepatic hydatid disease; and 15 (11.1%) patients had only extrahepatic disease. Clinical symptoms in patients with hepatic locations of the disease included abdominal pain localized in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant of the abdomen, tenderness, hepatomegaly with palpable abdominal mass, jaundice, fever, and anaphylactic reaction. All the patients were treated surgically. Surgical techniques included partial cystectomy and drainage, cystectomy and capitonage, cystectomy and omentoplasty, only drainage, left lateral hepatectomy, total pericystectomy, and laparoscopic pericystectomy. Rupture into the bile duct was managed by T-tube drainage or biliodigestive anastomosis. Symptoms and surgical treatment for extrahepatic cysts varied according to the location of the cyst. The median cyst diameter of all patients was 11 cm. The postoperative complication rate was 17.0%. Two patients died (1.5%). The median hospital stay was 18 days. The recurrence rate was 6.7%. The study suggests that treatment of this benign disease should be the less radical surgical technique combined with pre- and postoperative anthelmintic administration. The surgical treatment should be combined with careful use of scolicidal fluids and aspiration of the cyst to avoid contamination and minimize the risk of recurrence."

Biliary injury during LC is still a serious problem. Knowledge of anatomic detail is important for not encountering the injury. Magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) is a noninvasive method for imaging the biliary ducts. However, MRC has many drawbacks such as not showing anatomic structures in detail and respiratory motion. In this study, contrast-enhanced MRC is used to show cystic ducts that are not seen by MRC. Reasons for patient referral for MRC and contrast-enhanced MRC included suspicion of cholecystolithiasis, adenomyomatosis, and gallbladder polyp. Our results show that routine MRC revealed cystic ducts in 38 patients (77.5%) and contrast-enhanced MRC in 46 patients (93.8%). Intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) was taken as gold standard for all patients. We found that contrast-enhanced MRC can provide a useful supplement to MRC in patients with nonvisualized cystic ducts by MRC. To our knowledge, this is the first study of visualization of cystic duct in patients undergoing LC depicted by both MRC and contrast-enhanced MRC."

A questionnaire was mailed to all surgeons with experience in laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the Campania region. Data were collected from January 1991 to December 2003. Each patient was requested to indicate age, gender, associated diseases, site and type of lesion, surgical experience, diagnosis, treatment and complications. Twenty-six surgeons answered the questionnaire. Fifty-one patients (36 F/15 M; mean age: 42.5 +/- 11.9, range 13-91 years) with bile duct injuries following laparoscopic cholecystectomy were reported. The most frequent lesions were main bile duct partial or total transection. The intraoperative mortality rate was 1/51 (1.9%) due to a complex biliary and vascular injury. The postoperative mortality rate of revision surgery was 5/50 (10%). T-tube positioning (n = 20) and Roux-en-Y hepato-jejunostomy (n = 20) were the procedures most frequently performed. The complication rate in patients treated with the T-tube was significantly higher than in those treated with hepatico-jejunostomy.

Four patients who were operated by laparotomy are asyntomatic. Patient who was treated by ERCP needed a new ERCP in first posoperative month. Five years ago, she had a seriuos acute pancreatitis and we decided laparotomy and biliar derivation. Since laparotomy, she had two new episodes of acute pancreatitis and she has needed a new endoscopic dilatation with ballon by ERCP. She has been asyntomatic for four months. In conclusion, we think laparotomy with biliar derivation is safer than ERCP in management of children with choledochal cyst.

CD009323,0,16023436,0,The advancing art and science of endoscopy.,"Flexible endoscopy continues to advance encompassing treatment of a variety of diseases traditionally managed surgically. This review describes and evaluates many of these new endoscopic approaches with an eye toward the future. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is now treated with several endoscopic, non-operative techniques. A procedure using radiofrequency energy delivered by a peroral catheter with small needles inserted into the wall of the esophagus causes collagen deposition and ablates transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, both of which reduce reflux. With this treatment, >80% of patients will reduce or stop their medication for reflux. Trials involving new injectable materials show promise with a 75-80% improvement in heartburn-related quality-of-life scores and reduced medication use. Endoscopic suture and stapling devices restore the antireflux barrier with sutures that create a pleat or plication at the gastroesophageal junction. Early results indicated that 62-74% of patients had significant improvement. Long-term results are not available for any of these new techniques and there seems to be a drop off in effectiveness over time. Gastrointestinal bleeding has been more effectively managed with the recent introduction of small clips and detachable snares to control bleeding vessels. Banding and sclerotherapy for variceal bleeding has all but eliminated urgent operation for that diagnosis. In the biliary-pancreas realm, endoscopic management of pancreatic pseudocysts, stenting of pancreatic or biliary strictures and fistulae have reduced operative indications in those disease processes. Pseudocyst drainage involves creation of a transenteric communication between the pseudocyst and the stomach or duodenum. Complete cyst resolution without recurrence can be expected in 85% of patients. While endoscopic palliation of malignant biliary strictures has been accepted for years, experience with endoscopic management of iatrogenic strictures indicates that it may serve as an alternative option without surgery in many patients. Enteric stenting using metallic self-expanding stents in the esophagus, duodenum, and colon allows alleviation of obstruction without surgery for palliantation and in the colon may relieve obstruction to avoid colostomy prior to an elective resection. On the horizon stands the flexible endoscopic route to the abdominal cavity via the transgastric route and the promise of combined endoscopic-laparoscopic approaches to complex abdominal problems. General surgeons should rekindle their interest in flexible endoscopy or risk losing entire categories of disease to other specialties or to a small specialized group of endoscopic surgeons."

We performed the first laparoscopic donor distal pancreatectomy in 1999. We herein present our initial experience with five hand-assisted laparoscopic donor pancreatectomies. Three donors underwent distal pancreatectomy alone; two underwent a simultaneous left nephrectomy. The mean donor age was 48.4+/-8.7 years with a body mass index of 23.7 kg/m2. The donor and recipient survival rate was 100% at up to 3 years of follow-up. There were no episodes of pancreatitis, leaks, or pseudocysts. All donors returned to their preoperative state of health and to work. None of the donors have required oral anti-diabetic medications or insulin. We conclude that laparoscopic donor distal pancreatectomy is a safe and efficient procedure; hand-assisted laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy appears to be preferable, because of the added margin of safety from increased tactile feedback and ease of pancreatic dissection. The procedure can be accomplished with a single 6-cm periumbilical incision and only two 12-mm ports, resulting in excellent cosmesis and high donor satisfaction."

Nevertheless, surgical therapy provides the only chance for cure and longterm survival. Achievement of an R0 situation certainly is the primary surgical therapeutic goal. Reduction of surgical radicality in respect to the stomach and the pancreas itself obviously does not influence long-term survival of the patients. Thus, in the majority of patients the pylorus-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas seems to be the best operative strategy for resection of a carcinoma in the head of the pancreas. Concerning lymphadenectomy and resection of the portal or superior mesenteric vein surgical radicality is increasing during the last years. Perioperative mortality after resection of the head of the pancreas could be reduced in high volume centers below 5%. This is true even if parts of the portal or superior mesenteric vein are resected in addition. There are for the first time reports of patients who have survived longer than 5 years after resection of a pancreatic carcinoma. Further improvement of long-term survival, however, will not be achieved by increasing surgical aggressiveness but only by the use of new multimodal therapeutic protocols."

Prevention and diagnosis of bile duct injuries].","Endoscopic invasive procedures in 70th and 80th years leaded to decrease reoperations on biliary tree. Iatrogenic injury of the biliary tract have increased in incidence in the first decade with the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Athough a number of factors have been identified with a high risk of injury ( and number of technical steps have been emphasized to avoid these injury, the incidence of the bile duct injury has reached at least double the rate observed with open cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy is most frequently performed abdominal operation and the most serious complication associated with this procedure is accidental injury to the common bile duct (0.3-0.4%). This preventable technical error has tradicionally been thought to occur in one or more of three situations: 1. When the operator attempts to clip or ligate a bleeding cystic artery and also clips the common hepatic duct (Fig. 3a). 2. When too much traction has been exerted on the gallbladder so that the common bile duct has tented up into an albow, which was either tied off with ligature or clipped (Fig. 3b). 3. When anatomic anomalies were not recognized and the wrong structure is divided, for example, when the cystic duct winds anterior to the common bile duct and enters on the left side, or when the cystic duct joins the right hepatic duct rather than the junction of the common hepatic and the common bile ducts (Fig. 1, 2, 3cd). In anatomical incertain cases is discussed about cholangiography and cholecystocholangiography during laparoscopy cholecystectomy. Most patients sustained a bile duct injury are recognized in the weeks folloving laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Careful preoperative preparation should include control of sepsis by draining any bile collections or fistulas and komplete cholangiography. Long-term results are best achieved in specialized hepatobiliary centres performing biliary reconstruction with a Roux-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Success rates over 90% have been reported from several centres to date with intermediate follow-up. Papila injury increased with introduction of a invasive endoscopy. Risk of deadly retroperitoneal inflamation is very high. Injury require same surgery procedure as duodenum injury."

Favourable response to conservative treatment does not prevent the need for splenectomy, as calcifiying chronic pancreatitis may progress locally. We report three cases of spontaneous rupture of the spleen. In two cases, splenic rupture revealed calcifying chronic pancreatitis and both patients underwent urgent splenectomy. In the third case, the patient was known to have calcifying chronic pancreatitis, and splenectomy was performed because of unsuccessful conservative treatment.

Acute cholecystitis indicates an increased risk.,"During the last decade laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has become established as the gold standard. The drawbacks in the form of bile duct (BD) injuries have also come into focus. We present the results of a prospective, consecutive series of 1568 patients with reference to BD injuries regarding risks, management, and preventive measures. The significant complications of all patients operated upon with LC between October 1999 and December 2003 were recorded prospectively. BD injuries were classified according to Strasberg into types A-E. Transected major BDs, injuries of type E, were regarded as ""major"" injuries and types A, B, C, and D were ""minor"" injuries. Major BDs were transected in five patients (0.3%), three of whom had acute cholecystitis. In the two patients operated on electively, the BD injuries were detected postoperatively, while they were detected intraoperatively when the operation was performed of necessity. The BDs were all reconstructed with a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Two patients had anastomotic strictures. Minor BD injuries were encountered in 19 patients (1.2%). The 13 patients with leakage from the cystic duct or gallbladder bed, injury type A, were treated by endoscopic (ERC) stenting without sequelae. Five patients sustained a lateral BD injury, type D; they were treated with a simple suture over a T-tube (at LC) or endoscopically (ERC) without further problems. A transected aberrant right hepatic BD, type C injury, was due to its small-caliber sutured. Minor BD injuries could be managed at the primary hospital if the endoscopic expertise were at hand.

CD009323,0,15966190,0,Right hepatic duct opening into the cystic duct: the role of pre- and intraoperative cholangiography.,"Although an aberrant hepatic duct entering the cystic duct is not especially rare, the main right hepatic duct entering the cystic duct is extremely rare. A 69-year-old woman developed severe intermittent right upper quadrant pain and high fever. A diagnosis of acute calculus cholecystitis was made by radiographic examinations. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrated dilatation of the right hepatic duct, but could not identify the junction of the right hepatic duct and the cystic duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography established that the right hepatic duct joined the cystic duct and that cholecystolithiasis was present. As the right hepatic duct entering the cystic duct can lead to ductal injury, this anomaly should be kept in mind when performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Pre- and intraoperative cholangiography contribute to the avoidance of iatrogenic bile duct injury. When the right hepatic duct drains into the cystic duct, the gallbladder should be removed distal to the junction of the hepatic and cystic ducts."

The resection of the total layer is sometimes needed to get a tumor-free margin. Moreover, lymph node metastasis is not predicted only by tumor size. Laparoscopic surgery is less invasive compared with conventional open surgery. We describe a new method, endoscopic total layer resection with laparoscopic sentinel node dissection and defect closure.

We studied our 8-year experience by retrospective chart review. Patient demographic data, splenic pathology, intraoperative events, concomitant procedures, and all adverse perioperative events were recorded. A total of 131 patients had laparoscopic splenectomy, and there were 8 conversions to open surgery. Pathology included 63 with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), 23 malignancies, 12 thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), 10 autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and 23 others. Accessory spleens were noted in 21 patients (16%). Concomitant surgical procedures included 12 hepatic biopsies, 4 distal pancreatectomies, 4 cholecystectomies, and 7 others. Mean operative time was 170 minutes. There were 16 major complications in 16 patients and 2 deaths. Median postoperative length of stay was 3 days. Conversions, due mostly to bleeding, are related to splenic pathology and medical comorbidity and are not temporally related to surgical experience (learning curve). The morbidity, mortality, and conversion rates were low. Laparoscopic splenectomy permits an appropriate abdominal exploration and is associated with a short hospital stay.

Biliary injury during LC is still a serious problem. Knowledge of anatomic detail is important for not encountering the injury. Magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) is a noninvasive method for imaging the biliary ducts. However, MRC has many drawbacks such as not showing anatomic structures in detail and respiratory motion. In this study, contrast-enhanced MRC was used to show cystic ducts that are not seen on MRC. Reasons for patient referral for MRC and contrast-enhanced MRC included suspicion of cholecystolithiasis, adenomyomatosis, and gallbladder polyp. Our results show that routine MRC revealed cystic ducts in 38 patients (77.5%) and contrast-enhanced MRC in 46 patients (93.8%). Intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) was taken as gold standard for all patients. We found that contrast-enhanced MRC can provide a useful supplement to MRC in patients with cystic ducts not seen on MRC.

CD009323,0,15916149,0,[Laparoscopic management of small-bowel obstruction].,"Laparoscopy is not generally accepted as an effective, advantageous alternative to formal laparotomy for abdominal emergencies. Its use in patients with previous surgery and intestinal obstruction is often debatable. A retrospective study was performed to analyse the results of the laparoscopic approach for acute small-bowel obstruction in terms of efficacy and safety. From January 2000 to December 2003, 44 non-consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic surgery for radiologically documented small-bowel obstruction. Thirty-nine (89%) had undergone previous abdominal operations (mean number of laparotomies: 2; range 1-5). Twelve were men and 32 women (mean age: 57 years; range 13-91). We retrospectively reviewed the patient data, analysing operative time, need for accessory incision or conversion, length of hospital stay, and intraoperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality. The aetiology was established in 40 patients (91%), and the procedures were completed laparoscopically in 28/44. Mean operative time was 58 min (range 25-160). Six patients required an accessory target incision and 10 patients were converted to formal laparotomy. The reasons for conversion were extent of adhesions (n = 3), problems with laparoscopic view (n = 2), gangrenous bowel (n = 2), locally advanced colon cancer (n = 1), haemoperitoneum (n = 1), and diffuse peritonitis (n = 1). The mean hospital stay was 6 days (range 2-28). Postoperative mortality and morbidity were 2% and 16%, respectively. In conclusion, this study suggest that laparoscopy should be considered early in the clinical course of patients presenting with acute small-bowel obstruction. In most patients definitive treatment is possible, effective and safe, thus justifying the early laparoscopic approach."

A 47-year-old female presented to her internist with nausea and mild epigastric abdominal pain. Laboratory evaluation revealed slightly elevated bilirubin and liver function tests as well as neutropenia. An abdominal ultrasound revealed normal biliary and pancreatic anatomy and multiple splenic lesions. Computed tomography of the abdomen confirmed the multiple hypodense lesions within the spleen. The differential diagnosis at this time included neoplasm, infection, and autoimmune etiologies. Subsequently, the patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy with splenectomy. No other intra-abdominal pathology was found. Pathology revealed multiple noncaseating, splenic granulomas. Isolated extrapulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis occur in only 10% of these patients. Moreover, isolated splenic sarcoidosis is rare. Currently, the literature documents only two prior cases of sarcoidosis presenting with isolated splenic lesions. Primary management consists of medical therapy with prednisone, methotrexate, and/or antimalarial drugs. Indications for surgery include symptomatic splenomegaly, severe hypersplenism, prophylaxis for splenic rupture, and neoplastic exclusion. Our patient required a laparoscopic splenectomy for diagnostic purposes and neoplastic exclusion. Once diagnosed, patients require continual follow-up for systemic manifestations and associated complications of sarcoidosis."

CD009323,0,15862272,0,Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy.,"Distal pancreatectomy with spleen preservation may be the preferred procedure for certain benign tumors and cystic lesions of the pancreatic body or tail. Alternatively, laparoscopic removal including either distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy or splenic-preservation with ligation of the splenic vessels have also been described. We describe, herein, our method to perform spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy that preserves the splenic vessels and hence splenic function. The described technique of spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy has been used in two patients with favorable results. Both patients underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with splenic conservation for an oligocystic serous cystadenoma and serous cystadenoma. Operative time was 3-6 hours with total blood loss of less than 200 cc in both cases. The length of stay in the hospital was 4-8 days and both patients returned to work within 3 weeks. Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy should be considered for younger patients with select body or tail lesions that are not candidates for less extensive procedures."

CD009323,0,15852291,0,"Laparoscopic resection of congenital choledochal cyst, hepaticojejunostomy, and externally made Roux-en-Y anastomosis.","The authors present a 3-month-old patient with a congenital choledochal cyst, which was asymptomatic until treatment. On laparoscopy, a type I choledochal cyst was confirmed and excised laparoscopically. A Roux-en-Y anastomosis was constructed after exteriorization of the small bowel via the infraumbilical trocar incision. A laparoscopic end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy was carried out. The operation lasted 4(1/2) hours, without intraoperative problems. Oral food intake was started on day 2 and well tolerated with bile stained stools. Symptoms of bowel obstruction occurred on day 8. On minilaparotomy, the Roux-en-Y anastomosis was found to be adherent to the mesenterium of the colon, leading to obstruction. After mobilizing the loop, the postoperative course was uneventful. We conclude that laparoscopic resection of congenital choledochal cyst and choledochojejunostomy was feasible in the youngest patient operated on so far. However, adhesive small bowel obstruction can also occur, as after conventional operation, when the bowel is exteriorized for Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy."

CD009323,0,15848700,0,Surgical nuances in pancreas transplantation.,"The modern surgical era of vascularized pancreas transplantation (PTX) began with the systemic-bladder drainage technique. According to International Pancreas Transplant Registry (IPTR) data, most PTX procedures are performed with systemic venous delivery of insulin and either bladder (systemic bladder) or enteric (systemic-enteric) drainage of the exocrine secretions. Since 1995 the number of PTX procedures performed with primary enteric drainage has increased dramatically, accounting for more than 70% of cases since 2001. Despite an evolution in exocrine drainage, the proportion of enteric drained PTXs with portal venous delivery of insulin (portal enteric drainage) has remained low, representing about 20% of cases. In recent IPTR analyses no differences were reported in short-term outcomes according to surgical technique. Coincident with more physiologic implantation techniques, the surgical complication rate has decreased to 10% to 20%. Experience with donor and recipient selection can reduce morbidity, inasmuch as risk factors for surgical complications include prolonged pre-transplantation peritoneal dialysis, donor or recipient BMI body mass index >28 kg/m2, donor or recipient age older than 45 years, cerebrovascular cause of donor brain death, prolonged preservation, and prior abdominal surgery in the recipient. New techniques include simultaneous living donor kidney and deceased donor PTX, gastroduodenal artery revascularization, laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy and distal pancreatectomy, en bloc kidney and pancreas transplantation, P-E drainage with venting jejunostomy, retroperitoneal PTX with P-E drainage, and unusual vascular grafts. In the future the emphasis will shift from short-term surgical to long-term medical outcomes as the ultimate measure of success."

CD009323,0,15833477,0,Palliative therapy for pancreatic/biliary cancer.,"Palliative treatment for unresectable periampullary cancer is directed at three major symptoms: obstructive jaundice, duodenal obstruction, and cancer-related pain. In most cases, the pattern of symptoms at the time of diagnosis in the context of the patient's medical condition and projected survival influence the decision to perform an operative versus a non operative palliative procedure. Despite improvements in preoperative imaging and laparoscopic staging of patients with periampullary cancer and hilar cholangiocarcinoma, surgical exploration is the only modality that can definitively rule out resectability and the potential for curative resection in some patients with nonmetastatic cancer. Furthermore, only surgical management achieves successful palliation of obstructive symptoms and cancer-related pain as a single procedure during exploration. To take advantage of the long-term advantages afforded by surgical palliation,operative procedures must be performed with acceptable morbidity. The average postoperative length of hospital stay for patients who undergo surgical palliation is less than 15 days, even in those who develop minor complications. The average survival of patients who receive surgical palliation alone for nonmetastatic, unresectable pancreatic cancer is approximately 8 months. As with all treatment planning, palliative therapy for pancreatic and biliary cancer should be planned using a multidisciplinary approach, including input from the surgeon, gastroenterologist, radiologist,and medical and radiation oncologist. In this way, quality of life can be optimized in most patients with these diseases."
CD009323,0,15831223,0,New approaches to the minimally invasive treatment of pancreatic cancer.,"Advances in minimally invasive surgery have revolutionized the field of surgery. Despite the great strides in equipment and experience, operative conduct remains confined by the limits of exposure. Retroperitoneal fat can be abundant and can contribute greatly to difficulty in exposure. Visceral organs ventral to the retroperitoneum preclude direct access and require optimal patient positioning to operate. Additionally, the major vascular pedicles all originate in the retroperitoneum off of the abdominal aorta or enter the inferior vena cava. The pancreas, in particular, is surrounded by the portal vein, celiac axis, superior mesenteric vein and artery, and splenic vein and artery. If injured during surgery, these vessels can present a life-threatening emergency. The issues related to the vasculature, coupled with the difficulty in resecting portions of the pancreas and the relative paucity of pancreatic procedures, have greatly concentrated these cases at tertiary care centers staffed by experienced laparoscopists. However, as surgical technology improves and fellowships train more surgeons with advanced laparoscopic skills, minimally invasive pancreatic surgery may diffuse with more community-based health care networks."

CD009323,0,15821930,0,"""Sugar"" tumor of the pancreas: a rare entity that is diagnosable on preoperative fine-needle biopsies.","This study is the second to report a pancreatic ""sugar"" tumor (ST) case. This ST was incidentally discovered in a 31-year-old woman using computed tomography scan (CT scan) for work-up of a hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia. Both CT scan and endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS) features evoked a 15-mm large benign endocrine tumor. Pathological examination of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsies could not confirm this diagnosis. Laparoscopic corporeo-caudal pancreatectomy was performed. The tumor was intrapancreatic, well circumscribed, and organized in sheets of epithelioid cells. The tumor cells expressed HMB-45 but did not express epithelial or endocrine immunohistochemical markers. These histophenotypic features are those of an extra pulmonary ST, which belong to the PEComa family of tumors. Retrospective examination of preoperative biopsies evidenced the same histophenotypic features. This observation highlights that STs should be considered in preoperative differential diagnosis of pancreas tumors, since they may be treated by limited surgical resection."

We present our experience with laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy in two such patients, and discuss the operative technique with emphasis on organ preservation. Two female patients aged 63 and 69 years presented with clinical and biochemical features of an insulinoma and a vasoactive intestinal peptide secreting tumor (VIPoma), and were found on cross-sectional imaging to have 1.2-cm and 4.5-cm solitary tumors in the tail of the pancreas. They underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with and without preservation of splenic vessels and spleen respectively. Both procedures were completed laparoscopically. The operating time was 180 and 210 minutes respectively. There were no postoperative complications. The postoperative hospital stay was 4 and 14 days respectively. Histology revealed a benign insulinoma and a malignant VIPoma with lymph node metastases respectively. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas may be accomplished safely, with preservation of the spleen and splenic vessels in benign disease, and with benefits to the patients in terms of postoperative recovery."

Even if laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) is a well established surgical procedure, performing the urinary diversion completely intracorporeal, is still a challenge due to technical difficulties and associated complications. The aim of our study is to present the first series of LRC with ureterosigmoidostomy. Since May 2004 were performed 7 LRC (5 males and 2 females) (Gr. A). All cases were T2N0 clinical stage. These patients were compared with a retrospective group of 50 patients who underwent open procedure (Gr. B) in term of: operative time, blood loss, analgesic requirements, and hospital stay. LRC has a longer operative time but with statistically significant lower blood loss, less analgesia, and shorter hospital stay. The resection margins of the surgical specimens were tumor free at pathologic examination. Long-term follow-up is pending. On short-term, the results of laparoscopic radical cystectomy are encouraging.

Since it was first reported in 1898, <400 cases have been described in the literature, and only three of them were diagnosed and treated by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our objective here is to describe an approach that allows a definitive diagnosis and treatment. First we present the case of a febrile 81-year-old woman with acute right upper quadrant pain. Ultrasound showed an alithiasic distended gallbladder with a multilayered wall and a transverse orientation. When exploratory laparoscopy was performed, a gangrenous gallbladder secondary to a 360 degrees clockwise cystic pedicle torsion was found. Laparoscopic decompression, detorsion, and cholecystectomy with an intraoperative cholangiogram were completed. The patient was discharged 72 h later.

Benign stenoses of the bile duct are mainly caused by cholecystectomy or liver resection or by inflammatory diseases. Insertion of an endoprosthesis insertion or balloon dilation is clinically successful in 60 to 90 % of these patients and will result in adequate opening of the stricture. To date, only bile duct stenosis in chronic pancreatitis are not improved satisfactorily by endoscopy. The insertion of an endoprosthesis is a cornerstone in the treatment of malignant obstructive jaundice in patients with cancer. Several comparative studies have demonstrated the advantages of self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) over plastic prostheses in terms of patency. A selective use of SEMS is mandatory, as the costs for SEMS are high and many patients with malignant jaundice will die with their first plastic prosthesis in situ without stent occlusion. In patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma, the combination of photodynamic therapy and endoprosthesis insertion might result in a survival advantage. The use of bioabsorbable stent materials or coating of the stent with antiproliferative drugs will improve the treatment results in the future."

In patients with intractable pain, percutaneous or surgical celiac plexus block can be performed, celiac ganglion alcoholization and torachoscopic splacnicectomy can be done. The laparoscopic approach for staging, allows us to identify very small peritoneal or hepatic metastasis, local invasion or deep hepatic metastasis. The lack of tactile sensation is a disadvantage in the laparoscopic procedures for both staging and resection; which can be compensated utilizing laparoscopic ultrasound. The laparoscopic pancreatic approach for resection is useful to treat neuroendocrine tumors, chronic pancreatitis and cystic neoplasm allowing preservation of the splenic vessels and the spleen. The insulinoma is a treatable laparoscopic tumor given its unique characteristics.

Although no randomised trial exists comparing open with endoscopic adrenalectomy, the endoscopic approach has proven to be safe with lower morbidity and shorter hospital stay compared with open surgery. For parathyroidectomy several different minimal invasive techniques have been described (i.e. fully endoscopic, videoscopic assisted, and focused using mini-incision). Prerequisits for all of these approaches are a positive preoperative localisation of the adenoma, an intraoperative parathormone testing, and the respective surgical experience in the minimal invasive technique. Proponents of the videoendoscopic assisted thyroidectomy mention the enhanced exposure of the surgical field to be beneficial. However, drawbacks of this technique are the fact that a minority of patients qualify for this approach and that the learning curve is quite long for the surgeon. The experience with the laparoscopic approach to endocrine pancreatic tumours is still limited. Good indications are insulinomas that are located anteriorly or within the tail of the pancreatic gland.

CD009323,0,15756395,0,Ampullary tumors: endoscopic versus operative management.,"Most ampullary adenomas (80%) are common benign ampullary tumors; however, they can range from mild dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia to invasive carcinoma. They are considered premalignant lesions found in the setting of familial polyposis syndromes or found sporadically, usually manifested by vague abdominal pain, liver enzyme elevation, jaundice, recurrent pancreatitis, or with uncommon symptoms such as gastrointestinal bleeding or duodenal obstruction. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with biopsy is a minimally invasive technique used to visualize these tumors directly and to evaluate their histologic characteristics. Definitive treatment primarily depends on these histologic results. Local resection has a high rate of recurrence (5% to 30%) and requires postoperative endoscopic surveillance, which is the reason it is not considered as a first choice in the management of ampullary tumors. The operative mortality is 10% or less for pancreaticoduodenectomy, a procedure of choice at most experienced centers for frank carcinoma, foci papillary adenocarcinoma in pre-excisional biopsies, or high-grade dysplasia ampullary adenomas. Endoscopic interventions for presumed benign ampullary adenomas have resolved symptoms of obstruction, but long-term follow up is necessary to detect early malignant transformation. In summary, the choice of treatment depends on level of surgical skill available, patient tolerance of long-term endoscopic surveillance versus radical surgery, and the presence or absence of coexisting familial adenomatous polyposis."

CD009323,0,15749601,0,Laparoscopic surgery in patients with sporadic and multiple insulinomas associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.,"There have recently been reports of a limited number of laparoscopic procedures in patients with clinically manifest hyperinsulinism. However, the precise role of laparoscopy remains unknown. Between January 1998 and September 2003, 11 consecutive patients (10 women and 1 man; mean age, 40 years; age range, 22-66 years) with sporadic insulinoma and two female patients (25 and 40 years old) with multiple insulinomas associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) were operated on using the laparoscopic approach. Endoscopic ultrasonography was used to localize the tumor preoperatively in 90% of patients with sporadic insulinoma. In patients with MEN-1, computed tomography and octreoscan-(111)In demonstrated multiple tumors. Laparoscopic ultrasonography (LapUS) was performed in all patients for operative decision-making. Of 11 patients with sporadic insulinoma, laparoscopic enucleation (LapEn) was planned in 8 patients, but in 1 patient, the use of LapUS missed the tumor and the patient was converted to open surgery. Mean operating time after LapEn (seven patients) was 180 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 200 ml. The mean hospital stay was 5 days. In three of the 11 patients, laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (LapSPDP) was performed; the mean operative time was 240 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 360 ml. Postoperative complications occurred in three of seven patients after LapEn (three pancreatic fistulas managed conservatively, and one case of bleeding requiring reoperation). LapSPDP was performed in both patients with MEN-1; in one patient with splenic vessel preservation (SVP), the operating time was 210 minutes and blood loss was 650 ml, with a hospital stay of 6 days. In another patient without SVP, the operating time was 150 minutes and blood loss was 300 ml. The latter patient developed a 4-cm splenic infarct managed conservatively, and the hospital stay was 14 days. LapEn and LapSPDP are feasible and safe and achieved cure in patients with sporadic insulinoma and multiple insulinomas associated with MEN-1. However, the risk of pancreatic leakage after LapEn remains high, and LapSPDP without SVP may be associated with splenic infarct."

Episodes of severe hypoglycemia and progressive obesity are the most frequent clinical signs. Surgical resection of the tumours is always indicated for cure.

CD009323,0,15738842,0,[The risk of biliary ductal injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,"The incidence of iatrogenic injuries of the bile ducts has increased significantly since laparascopic cholecystectomy became the ""gold standard"" in the treatment of cholelithiasis. The incidence of major biliary ductal injury ranges from 0.25% to 0.74%, and of minor injury from 0.28% to 1.7%. The cause of the injury is not always clearly identifiable. In more than half the cases, the injury occurs during maneuvers to isolate the cystic duct or to free the gallbladder from the common bile duct. These maneuvers may be more difficult and consequently more dangerous when there is significant inflammation as may be seen in acute cholecystitis, or in case of obesity, cirrhosis with portal hypertension, previous surgery with peritoneal adhesions, or anatomic variations of the hepatic pedicle. Pre-operative evaluation of clinical risk factors should be coupled with intra-operative caution and instrumental evaluation. The increase in frequency of iatrogenic biliary injuries can not be attributed simply to the inexperience of the surgeon or the learning curve as was initially suggested. Many injuries are due, rather, to the surgeon's failure to respect basic technical rules, long established for open cholecystectomy and which should not be modified for the laparoscopic technique. While routine cholangiography does not offer complete protection from iatrogenic ductal injuries, it is essential to visualize the biliary tract whenever a lesion of the ductal system is clearly identified or even suspected. In such cases, facility with the technique of intraoperative cholangiography and a knowledge of the radiological anatomy of the biliary tree are essential for an accurate and complete intraoperative evaluation of the biliary injury. Finally, in the presence of acute or chronic inflammation or other factors for technical difficulty (obesity, cirrhosis, previous surgery, anatomic variations, intraoperative bleeding), the surgeon must not hesitate to consider conversion to an open surgical approach. In such complicated cases, even the open approach is not a guarantee against biliary injury; there is no substitute for experience and caution in biliary surgery."

The gross and microscopic anatomy of the cystic duct is reviewed together with results from laboratory investigations into the function of the cystic duct and its spirally arranged folds. The duct and spiral folds contain muscle fibers responsive to pharmacologic, hormonal, and neural stimuli. There is, however, no convincing evidence of a discrete muscular sphincter within the duct. Although the cystic duct is unlikely to play a major role in gallbladder filling and emptying, it appears to function as more than a passive conduit. Coordinated, graded muscular activity in the cystic duct in response to hormonal and neural stimuli may facilitate gallbladder emptying. The principal function of the internal spiral folds that are found in man and other animals may be to preserve patency of this narrow, tortuous tube rather than to regulate bile flow."

CD009323,0,15650797,0,Heterogeneity of subvesical ducts or the ducts of Luschka: a study using drip-infusion cholangiography-computed tomography in patients and cadaver specimens.,"The objective of this study was to examine the heterogeneity of the subvesical duct or the ducts of Luschka as well as the reliability of drip-infusion cholangiography with computed tomography (DIC-CT) for their identification. DIC-CT was used in 277 consecutive patients (135 men, 142 women) and for the dissection and histologic study of 10 cadaver livers. We found 32 subvesical ducts in 28 (10.1%) of 277 patients. Irrespective of whether the terminals were extra- or intraparenchymal, the subvesical ducts often (17/32 ducts, 15/28 patients) drained into a subsegmental duct of S5 or S4. Notably, some displayed an ""intermediate"" course along the gallbladder fossa with an intraparenchymal origin and terminated at S5. Such ducts tended to be seen in the elderly. Another 15 ducts drained into a thick, centrally located duct, such as the right sectorial or hepatic duct. The anatomic study demonstrated that the subvesical duct likely included the cystic vein-concomitant duct. A major type of subvesical duct, characterized by an intermediate course along its bed, appeared to result from degenerative exposure of a peripheral duct with aging. The subvesical duct draining into the thick duct included both a ""daughter branch,"" such as seen in the lung, and the so-called anomaly. Such ducts can be demonstrated with DIC-CT, but the incidence might be limited. However, the cystic vein/concomitant duct was difficult to identify radiologically. Consequently, although presurgical radiology is useful for avoiding bile leakage after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, surgeons should be aware of its limitations."

CD009323,0,15625032,0,Small Bowel Bleeding.,"The management of patients with small bowel bleeding remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. In most gastrointestinal bleeding episodes, the source of hemorrhage is localized to either the upper gastrointestinal tract or colon; however, in about 5% of cases, upper endoscopy and colonoscopy are nondiagnostic, and the small intestine is the site of bleeding. Patients with suspected small bowel source of bleeding may present with either occult blood loss or recurrent overt gastrointestinal hemorrhage requiring frequent blood transfusions and hospitalizations. Knowing the etiology and site of hemorrhage is essential prior to initiating appropriate therapy. The most common causes of small bowel bleeding are vascular ectasia, tumors, ulcerative diseases, and Meckel's diverticula. For patients with severe obscure bleeding, push enteroscopy with a 220- to 250-cm enteroscope is strongly recommended. This procedure provides not only a thorough examination for diagnosis, but also allows for biopsy, tattooing, and hemostasis of lesions. If enteroscopy is nondiagnostic, capsule endoscopy is recommended. A diagnostic capsule endoscopy will direct appropriate medical, endoscopic, or surgical intervention, depending on whether the lesion is single or multiple, and whether the patient is a surgical candidate for intraoperative enteroscopy. Intraoperative enteroscopy should be strongly considered in patients with recurrent bleeding and a nondiagnostic evaluation. Laparoscopy and intraoperative enteroscopy is highly recommended in young patients (< 50 years of age) because there is an increased frequency of small bowel tumors and Meckel's diverticulum which are amenable to surgical therapy."

The laparoscopy-assisted distal pancreatectomy procedure involved detaching the spleen and the distal pancreas from the retroperitoneum by a hand-assisted procedure, removing them from the peritoneal cavity through a small incision, and detaching the distal pancreas by ligating and transecting the short gastric artery and vein and the branches of the splenic artery and vein, while the spleen and main splenic artery and vein were preserved under direct view. The pancreatic parenchyma was transected with a stapling device (TL-30), and continuous suturing was added to the resected margin. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful; the patient started to eat and walk on postoperative day 2 and was discharged on day 8.

Patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer are considered candidates for novel treatment protocols. Stratification of patients into locally advanced disease versus metastatic disease is imperative to accurately evaluate treatment outcome. Between 1994 and 2000, 100 consecutive patients undergoing staging laparoscopy with radiologic evidence of unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer were identified from a prospective database. All patients had preoperative contrast-enhanced, thin-cut computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging and had no evidence of detectable metastatic disease. There were 53 men and 47 women, with a median age of 64 years. The disease site was the pancreatic head in 69 cases and the body or tail in 31. Radiographic assessment of nonresectability was due to encasement of the celiac or hepatic artery in 37 patients, of the portal vein and superior mesenteric vessels in 56, and extrapancreatic extension in 7. Laparoscopy identified metastatic disease in 37% of patients, not seen on preoperative imaging. Peritoneal disease was noted in 12 cases and liver metastasis in 18 cases, and 7 patients had both. Neither the primary tumor size nor location influenced the incidence of metastatic disease. Standard imaging modalities failed to detect metastatic disease in 37% of patients who were considered to have locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients considered for treatment protocols for locally unresectable pancreatic cancer should be staged laparoscopically before initiation of therapy."

During a 5-year period between July 1998 and July 2003, the authors attempted hepaticojejunostomy by a total laparoscopic approach in 10 patients with benign stricture disorders of the extrahepatic biliary tree. Six of these patients had type 1 (extrahepatic, fusiform) choledochal cyst and presented with pain, fever, and jaundice. Four of the patients had iatrogenic biliary strictures after cholecystectomy (2 patients after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and 2 patients after open cholecystectomy). These patients had a variable presentation 1 to 3 weeks after the primary procedure, with peritonitis and/or cholangitis or only progressive jaundice. For nine of the patients (90%), the procedure was completed entirely laparoscopically. The mean operative time was 326.6 min for the patients with choledochal cysts and 268 min for the patients with iatrogenic strictures. One patient with stricture after open cholecystectomy underwent conversion to an open repair because of severe anatomic distortion and fibrosis. Four patients drained bile postoperatively for 5 to 7 days. One patient with iatrogenic biliary stricture after open cholecystectomy required open revision of the anastomosis 18 months after laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy because of recurrent cholangitis. The remaining eight patients (80%) were doing well a mean follow-up period of 3.1 years (range, 3 months to 5 years). Total laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy is feasible for a select group of patients, but requires advanced laparoscopic skills, including intracorporeal suturing. It must be attempted only in centers well versed in advanced laparoscopic surgery."
CD009323,0,15578306,0,Bile leakage and resultant bile peritonitis during or after diagnostic laparoscopy: an unpredictable event.,"Bile peritonitis secondary to bile leakage is a rare complication of laparoscopy-guided liver biopsy. We report two cases of bile peritonitis occurring, respectively, during and 6 days after liver biopsy in patients with an initial diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis associated with chronic pancreatitis. In both cases, bile leakage was first managed by compression with a palpating probe and, at onset or worsening of symptoms, by suture during laparotomy. However, while the first patient progressed uneventfully during the postoperative period, the second died 13 days after laparotomy. In the latter patient, bile leakage was associated with bleeding from the biopsy site with consequently diminished peritoneal irritation and delayed onset of symptoms. In this patient, pancreatic carcinoma, of which evidence was found at autopsy, may also have contributed to the fatal outcome. In conclusion, bile leakage and secondary peritonitis may also occur in the absence of dilation of the biliary tree and may be fatal, especially if not recognized and treated early."

We report here on a case of an unsuspected congenital type-IA biliary cyst, according to Todani's classification encountered during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a 30-year-old woman complaining of acute abdominal pain with an unremarkable preoperative workup. The well-known risk of developing cystic cancer, mainly in the adult, means that an excisional operation is indicated to prevent such complications. Cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is the definitive treatment of choice, performed at a later stage after radiological and endoscopic confirmation, and after obtaining the patient's consent. Cholangio-MR, and ERCP have proved to be extremely useful for adequate identification of this kind of lesion."

Four women and three men underwent laparoscopic pancreatectomy and were recruited into the study retrospectively over the period from June 2002 to February 2004. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 4), intermediate pancreatectomy (n = 1) and distal pancreatic resection with splenectomy (n = 2) were successfully performed. Operative mortality was nil. The postoperative morbidity included two low-output pancreatic leaks. Mean operating time, blood loss and hospital stay were 342 minutes, 289 mL and 14 days, respectively. The pathological diagnosis was ductal adenocarcinoma in one, neuroendocrine tumour in five and metastatic melanoma in one. All patients are still well after a median follow-up of 7 months (range: 1-20 months). The patients appear to benefit from laparoscopic pancreatectomy for pancreatic tumours.

It is conventionally performed by a laparotomy. We report the successful laparoscopic application of this technique in a patient with gastric outlet obstruction secondary to recurrence of a previously resected hilar cholangiocarcinoma. A 38-year-old gentleman who had undergone a left hepatectomy with caudate lobectomy, excision of extrahepatic biliary tree, D2 regional lymphadenectomy and Roux-en-Y right hepaticojejunostomy presented 6 months later with symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. Computed tomography revealed a tumor mass in the region of the gastric antrum. Attempted endoscopic treatment with a metal stent was unsuccessful. He underwent a laparoscopic exclusion gastroenterostomy. The operative time was 200 minutes. Postoperative recovery was uncomplicated. There was no delay in gastric emptying and no recurrence of gastric outlet obstruction until the time of death 41 days later. Laparoscopic exclusion gastrojejunostomy is a feasible option for the palliation of gastric outlet obstruction caused by recurrent cholangiocarcinoma."

CD009323,0,15531247,0,A rare diagnosis for a pancreatic mass: splenosis.,"Splenosis, the autotransplantation of splenic tissue, has been designed to preserve organ functions after splenectomy. We present the first case of laparoscopic resection of a pancreatic splenosis, in a patient who had undergone a splenectomy 31 years before, complaining of abdominal pain and diarrhea. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed an enhancing hypervascular 3-cm solid mass in the body of the pancreas, mimicking a pancreatic cancer or a neuroendocrine tumor. A diagnostic laparoscopy was planned, and a 3-cm peripancreatic nodule with a long pedicle was visualized, with many nodules close to the tail of the pancreas and in the greater omentum. They were all resected, and the specimens obtained were immediately sent for frozen-section examination, which confirmed the diagnosis of heterotopic splenic tissue. Splenosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of the pancreatic masses in patients with previous splenic surgery. A hypervascular mass on CT scan should be regarded as an adenocarcinoma of the pancreas until proven otherwise. The possibility of a neuroendocrine tumor mandates an octreotide scan and gastrointestinal hormones dosage. In the unlikely event that all tests may produce equivocal results, a diagnostic laparoscopy is mandatory, in order to obtain an accurate histopathologic diagnosis."
CD009323,0,15529849,0,Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy for gastric outlet obstruction in pancreatic cancer.,"Up to 20 per cent of patients with pancreatic cancer develop gastric outlet obstruction. Traditionally, these patients have been managed with an open gastrojejunostomy. Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy may now be a preferable approach. We conducted a retrospective review of nine patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy in 2001-2004. All nine patients had unresectable pancreatic cancer. There were six men and three women. Median age was 66 years (range 36-87). Two patients had prior laparotomies for attempted resection. Four patients had previously placed duodenal stents that failed. Four others had undergone unsuccessful attempts of duodenal stenting. Median operating time was 116 minutes (range 75-300). There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open procedure. Median time to postoperative oral intake was 4 days (range 3-6), and median postoperative length of stay was 7 days (range 5-18). Eight of our nine patients were palliated successfully using this technique. There were no complications or deaths related to the operation. All patients were discharged from the hospital. Six patients have since died, with a median postoperative survival of 2.5 months (range 1.5-8). Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy provides safe and effective palliation of gastric outlet obstruction in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. This approach allows for rapid palliation in a group of patients with a very limited survival."
CD009323,0,15518140,0,[Minimally invasive endocrine surgery: aspects of diagnostic imaging].,"Since 1997 minimally invasive surgical techniques are used for the treatment of diseases of the adrenals, thyroid, parathyroid and the endocrine pancreas. In contrast to open surgical procedures special radiological examinations are the basis for minimally invasive techniques after biochemical testing. The basis of excellent results are a careful evaluation and preparation of the patient in a centre with experience in the open techniques and a frequency of at least 20 endoscopic adrenalectomies a year. Adrenal tumours can be removed endoscopically through a transperitoneal or an extraperitoneal route. The endoscopic exploration of the parathyroids in patients with biochemically proven primary hyperparathyroidism was modified to video-assisted exploration because of the long operating times. An alternative to the video-assisted procedure is the minimally invasive open exploration. With this technique reoperations can be performed and ipsilateral thyroid nodules (found in more than 50% in middle Europe) can be removed. Small solitary thyroid nodules are the indication for an endoscopic or video-assisted exploration of the thyroid. A laparoscopic exploration of the pancreas was performed in 68 patients with neuroendocrine pancreatic tumours. The experience of the surgical team improves the postoperative long term results, thus minimally invasive endocrine surgery should be performed in centres with great experience in the treatment of endocrine tumours and with the possibility of close contact to other specialists interested in this topic."
CD009323,0,15517485,0,Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery for islet cell tumors of the pancreas.,"The experience with laparoscopic pancreatic surgery (LPS) in general, and pancreatic islet cell tumors (ICTs) in particular, is still limited. Because insulinoma is the most prevalent tumor and is mostly benign, single, and curable with surgical excision, it comprises most of the cases. Our experience with 17 cases (10 insulinomas, 2 gastrinomas, 1 nesidioblastoma, 4 nonfunctioning tumors) and those recorded in the literature (93 cases) show that laparoscopic surgery for small, solitary benign islet cell tumors located in the body and tail is feasible and safe and can result in rapid postoperative recuperation and a complication rate comparable or lower than that achieved with open surgery. It duplicates the success rate seen with conventional surgery regarding intraoperative localization and cure of disease. The main morbidity continues to be the occurrence of a fistula (18%), most often after enucleation, but the clinical course is benign in most instances. Preoperative imaging studies are required for localization, and the combined use of biphasic helical computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasonography (US) seems to be cost-effective. The use of laparoscopic US is an integral part of the laparoscopic procedure, and the information achieved is valuable for both confirming localization and decision making concerning the most appropriate surgical procedure. In cases of distal pancreatectomy, splenic salvage, preferably with preservation of splenic vessels, is feasible albeit more demanding and can be achieved in most cases."
CD009323,0,15510313,0,Laparoscopic distal pancreatomy: are we ready for a standardized technique?,"This paper describes and discusses the surgical steps needed to perform a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. The current lack of standardization of the operative technique can account for the limited diffusion of this procedure. The issue of spleen preservation, which cannot be overemphasized, always demands an accurate surgical technique that results from proficiency both in open pancreatic surgery and advanced laparoscopy. The preservation of the splenic vessels or short gastric-vessel salvage is feasible, yet with different indications. Also, the splenic-vessels preservation procedure has two distinct technical options. The technique of occlusion of the pancreatic stump is crucial for reducing the risk of a postoperative fistula and should be tailored to the structural features of the gland at the transection line. Finally, the hand-assisted approach can provide distinctive advantages over the pure laparoscopic technique in selected circumstances."

CD009323,0,15494679,0,[Laparoscopic and general surgery guided by open interventional magnetic resonance].,"Interventional magnetic resonance (IMR) machines have produced unique opportunity for image-guided surgery. The open configuration design and fast pulse sequence allow virtual real time intraoperative scanning to monitor the progress of a procedure, with new images produced every 1.5 sec. This may give greater appreciation of anatomy, especially deep to the 2-dimensional laparoscopic image, and hence increase safety, reduce procedure magnitude and increase confidence in tumour resection surgery. The aim of this paper was to investigate the feasibility of performing IMR-image-guided general surgery, especially in neoplastic and laparoscopic field, reporting a single center -- St. Mary's Hospital (London, UK) -- experience. Procedures were carried out in a Signa 0.5 T General Elettric SP10 Interventional MR (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with magnet-compatible instruments (titanium alloy instruments, plastic retractors and ultrasonic driven scalpel) and under general anesthesia. There were performed 10 excision biopsies of palpable benign breast tumors (on female patients), 3 excisions of skin sarcoma (dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans), 1 right hemicolectomy and 2 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The breast lesions were localized with pre- and postcontrast (intravenous gadolinium DPTA) sagittal and axial fast multiplanar spoiled gradient recalled conventional Signa sequences; preoperative real time fast gradient recalled sequences were also obtained using the flashpoint tracking device. During right hemicolectomy intraoperative single shot fast spin echo (SSFSE) and fast spoiled gradient recalled (FSPGR) imaging of right colon were performed after installation of 150 cc of water or 1% gadolinium solution, respectively, through a Foley catheter; imaging was also obtained in an attempt to identify mesenteric lymph nodes intraoperatively. Concerning laparoscopic procedures, magnetic devices (insufflator, light source) were positioned outside scan room, the tubing and light head being passed through penetration panels. Intraoperative MR-cholangiography was performed using fast spin echo (SSFSE) techniques with minimal intensity projection 3-dimensional reconstruction. About skin sarcomas, 2 of them were skin recurrences of previously surgically treated sarcomas (all of them received preoperative biopsy) and the extent of the lesion was then determined using short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence. The skin was closed in each case without need for any plastic reconstruction. The breast lesions were visualized with both Signa and real-time imaging and all enhanced with contrast: 2 (20%) were visualized only after contrast enhancement; intraoperative real time imaging clearly demonstrated a resection margin in all cases. Maximum dimensions of breast specimens (range 8-50 mm, median 24.5 mm) were not significantly different from those measured by Signa (p>0.17, Student's paired t-test) or real time images (p>0.4): also there was no significant difference in lesion size between Signa and real time images (p>0.25). All postprocedure scans clearly demonstrated complete excision. The extent of the tumor at MR imaging was greater in each case than suggested by clinical examination. Adequate resection margins were planned using STIR sequences. Histological examination confirmed clear surgical margins of at least 1 cm in each case. During right hemicolectomy, both intraoperative SSFSE and FSPGR contrast imaging revealed the lesion and details of the colonic surface; imaging of the lymph node draining right colon was only partially successful, due to movement artifact. Concerning laparoscopic procedures, both FSE and SSFSE techniques produced reasonable images of the gallbladder and intrahepatic ducts, but the FSE imaging was of poor quality due to respiration artifact; however, SSFSE allowed visualization of the gallbladder and part of the common bile duct. About skin sarcomas, the extent of the tumor at MR imaging was greater in each case than suggested by clinical examination and in each case the complete tumor excision was confirmed. Histological examination confirmed clear surgical margins of at least 1 cm in each case. Intraoperative MR scanning reliably identifies palpable breast tumours and skin sarcomas and is sufficiently accurate to guide their surgical excision. Further work may be done to develop laparoscopic and open abdominal surgery as well."

CD009323,0,15494281,0,Endoscopic and surgical management of bile duct injury after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the first choice of management for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. While it is associated with decreased postoperative morbidity and mortality, bile duct injuries are reported to be more severe and more common (0-2.7%), when compared to open cholecystectomy (0.2-0.5%) [New Engl. J. Med. 234 (1991) 1073; Am. J. Surg. 165 (1993) 9; Surg. Clin. N Am. 80 (2000) 1127]. These bile duct injuries include leaks, strictures, transection and removal of (part of) the duct, with or without vascular damage. Bile duct injury might be due to misidentification of the biliary tract anatomy due to acute cholecystitis, large impacted stones, short cystic duct, anatomical variations, but also due to technical errors leading to bleeding with subsequent clipping and coagulation trauma [Ann. Surg. 237 (2003) 460]. Early recognition and adequate multidisciplinary approach is the cornerstone for the optimal final outcome. Suboptimal management of injuries often leads to more extensive damage to the biliary tree and its vasculature with as consequences biliary peritonitis, sepsis, abscesses, multiple organ failure, a more difficult (proximal) reconstruction and in the long run, secondary biliary cirrhosis, and liver failure. Despite increasing experience in performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the frequency of bile duct injuries has not decreased [Ann. Surg. 234 (2001) 549]. Therapy encompasses endoscopic stenting, percutaneous transhepatic dilatation (PTCD) and surgical reconstruction."
CD009323,0,15492659,0,Incidental cystadenoma after laparoscopic treatment of hepatic cysts: which strategy?,"Biliary cystadenoma is a very rare hepatic neoplasm, accounting for fewer than 5% of cystic neoplasms of the liver; regardless of the various diagnostic modalities, such a lesion may be difficult to distinguish preoperatively from a cystadenocarcinoma. Although a diagnosis of cystadenoma during open hepatic surgery demands a complete surgical resection, there are few reports describing the correct approach to such lesions after a laparoscopic approach. This article presents the first case series of incidental cystadenoma after laparoscopic surgery for hepatic cystic lesions. One patient with a polycystic liver disease treated with a laparoscopic enucleation of the larger cyst declined the reintervention after the diagnosis of cystadenoma; she had no recurrence at follow-up. One patient with a large simple hepatic cyst laparoscopically enucleated had no recurrence at the 18-month follow-up. In one patient, there was a high suspicion of recurrence of cystadenoma after the laparoscopic fenestration of a large cyst, but a histopathological specimen obtained after the open surgical resection could not confirm any signs of cystadenoma. The incidental finding of biliary cystadenoma after laparoscopic fenestration of a cystic hepatic lesion requires an open hepatic resection. When a complete laparoscopic enucleation of the cyst may be assured, a strict clinical, biochemical, and radiologic follow-up could be considered as the definitive treatment, demanding the surgical intervention only in case of recurrence or high suspicion for malignancy."

Data from large adult experiences indicate that the risk of bile duct injury, although small, is greater with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) than open cholecystectomy. This complication has not yet been documented in pediatric practice, where cholecystectomy is relatively uncommon. What method do parents and patients choose if consent is truly informed? Of 57 consecutive children undergoing cholecystectomy, an open procedure was specifically indicated in 20 (previous major gastrointestinal surgery in 11, concomitant major abdominal operation in four, and complex biliary tract disease in five) and LC in two (cystic fibrosis, severe autism). The remaining 35 patients were counseled in a standard manner about the relative merits of LC versus mini-cholecystectomy (MC) and allowed to choose. Specifically, they were informed that LC offers better cosmesis, less postoperative discomfort, and a shorter hospital stay, but in adults is associated with a slightly increased rate of bile duct injury (0.3-0.5% vs. 0.2%). All MCs were performed through a 4-cm incision. Parents chose LC in 23 cases and MC in 12. The median age of both groups was similar. No surgical complications occurred, and there were no conversions in the LC group. No patient had retained stones. LC patients were discharged home after a mean of 1.7 days and MC patients after 2.3 days (0.1 > p > 0.05). If an open or laparoscopic technique is not specifically indicated and if parents/patients are fully informed, a significant minority may opt for mini-cholecystectomy."

Surgical robotic systems are being used to apply laparoscopy to the surgical treatment of diseases in virtually every abdominal organ. Procedures demanding superior visualization or requiring complex reconstruction necessitating extensive suturing obtain the greatest benefit from robotics over conventional laparoscopy. Whereas advanced surgical robotic systems offer the promise of a unique combination of advantages over open and conventional laparoscopic approaches, clinical data demonstrating improved outcomes are lacking for robotic surgical applications within the abdomen. Outcomes data for surgical robotics are essential given the exorbitant costs associated with the use of these tools."

CD009323,0,15472543,0,Application of a new collagen-based sealant for the treatment of pancreatic injury.,"Pancreatic injury is the most frequent serious morbidity that can occur following laparoscopic splenectomy. The presumed mechanism of injury is direct trauma to the pancreatic tail during hilar dissection or transection with endovascular staplers. It was our aim to study the direct application of topical sealants to a pancreatic injury to prevent a pancreatic leak. A porcine model of pancreatic injury in a normal pancreas was developed. Fourteen animals underwent midline laparotomy and subtotal (8 cm) distal pancreatectomy. The pancreas was sharply divided and minimal cauterization used. A (1/4)-inch round Jackson Pratt drain was secured to the pancreatic stump in all animals. The control group (n = 7) underwent no further treatment. Two groups underwent treatment with a sealant. Group 1 (n = 3) had a hydrogel applied to the pancreatic remnant. Group 2 (n = 4) had a biodegradable sealant of PEG (polyethylene glycol)-collagen formulation applied to the pancreatic stump by aerosol. During the postoperative period, animals were fed 2.2 lb/d of a high fat (10% lard) diet to stimulate pancreatic exocrine function. Total daily drain outputs were recorded, and drain amylase content and serum amylase concentration were measured on postoperative days 3, 7, and 10. A significant pancreatic leak was defined as a drain to serum amylase content of greater than 3:1. Animals were killed on day 10 and explored for undrained fluid collections. The pancreas was removed for histologic evaluation. Control and treatment groups were compared using repeated measures ANOVA of log-transformed data. All animals survived until elective necropsy. In group 1, average total drain outputs were not significantly less than the controls (125 mL versus 269; P = .66). The mean drain/serum amylase concentration on days 3, 7, and 10 were not significantly different between group 1 and the control group. Group 2 had significantly less overall average drainage output than controls (40 mL versus 269 mL; P = .0006). Furthermore, group 2 had a significant reduction in pancreatic leaks on days 3, 7, and 10 as measured by mean drain/serum amylase concentration. No undrained fluid collections were identified at autopsy. Based on our experimental porcine model, a novel collagen-based, biodegradable hydrogel can prevent a ductal leak following pancreatic injury. These encouraging data have fostered application by aerosol treatment to the hilar bed at laparoscopic splenectomy to diminish capsular disruption from mechanical injury."

A 4-port-technique was performed, with a 4-way flexible choledochoscope, via a choledochotomy, for removal of the stones. The postoperative follow-up for recurrent stones was performed with a cholangiogram and an ultrasonogram, and the quality of life was evaluated by a questionnaire for the symptoms. The mean operating time was 288.3 (150-420) minutes. There was only one postoperative complication, but no intraoperative transfusions or perioperative mortality. Remnant stones were detected in 1 patient on the final T-tube cholangiogram, which was removed by percutaneous choledochoscopy, through the tract matured by the T-tube. There were no cholangitis or recurrent stones during the mean follow-up period of 31.4 (10-45) months.

So far its surgical approach represents the only credible possibility of treatment. Authors impart their experience regarding the external drainage of the restant posthydatid cavity, by using a completely extraperitoneal way of bringing out the drain, by means of the round ligament, an original method conceived and put into practice by Prof. D. Burlui in 1968. This technique is simple, without risks or complications, possible for most of the parasite hepatic locations, especially for the central segments, for which this method is superior to other surgical procedures. The greatest advantage of the extraperitoneal transomphalic route of the drain is the absence of the peritoneal losses and so the impossibility of biliary leakage occurrence. The radiological and the ultrasonic controls confirm the reduction and finally total fibrosis and disappearance of the remaining cavity, about two months after the surgery. In this moment the drainage may be suppressed. In December 2001, we added to this method an other original variant: the coelioscopic approach of the extraperitoneal transomphalic drainage of the restant posthydatid cavity, representing the aim of this paper."

The mass was homogeneously enhanced from the early phase to the super-delayed phase on enhanced CT. We suspected a nonfunctioning endocrine tumor of the pancreas, and surgery was performed laparoscopically. After dissecting the pancreatic tail away from the splenic hilum and the splenic vessels, it was resected using only a linear stapler. The histological diagnosis was an intrapancreatic accessory spleen. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 14, but was readmitted 6 days later because of a pancreatic fistula, which was treated by CT-guided percutaneous drainage."
CD009323,0,15449147,0,Current status of pulmonary embolism in general surgery in Japan.,"The true incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) after general surgery in Japan is unknown. We searched the PubMed and Japana Centra Revuo Medicina 1985-2002 databases, entering ""surgery"" and ""pulmonary embolism"" or ""thromboembolism"", and reviewed the reported incidence of clinical PE associated with general surgery in Japan. The overall incidence of PE after general surgery was 0.33%. Fatal PE was reported in 0.08% of the surgical population and the mortality rate of patients with PE was 31%. The incidence of PE after cancer surgery ranged from 0.57% after colon malignancy to 3.85% after pancreatic cancer surgery, and was significantly higher than that after surgery for noncancerous conditions (0.20%). The incidence of PE after various cancer operations corresponded to a moderate or high risk, as defined by the 6th American College of Chest Physicians consensus recommendations. There was no significant difference in the incidence of PE after laparoscopic and open abdominal surgery. The incidence of PE was four to six times lower in patients who had received mechanical prophylaxis, although the difference was not significant. In conclusion, the incidence of PE in Japanese surgical patients is not as low as previously thought. Perioperative prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism is important, but its benefits need to be confirmed by prospective clinical studies."
CD009323,0,15387115,0,Kidney and pancreas transplantation at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center.,"More than 1,100 transplants have been performed at WFUBMC, including 60 pediatric transplants and 40 pancreas transplants. The one-year living donor kidney graft survival rate exceeds 90% and the 2 year deceased donor kidney graft survival rate exceeds 80%. The current active waiting list includes more than 300 candidates. Despite more transplants being performed, we continue to under-serve our referral area, which has among the highest rates of hypertension, diabetes, and end stage renal disease in the country. The AOTP has experienced a period of rapid growth over the past 2 years based upon sharing of zero HLA antigen-mismatched kidneys, use of ECD kidneys, liberalization of donor and recipient selection criteria, and the continued development of the pancreas transplant and laparoscopic donor nephrectomy programs. The pancreas transplant program will continue to grow as the waiting list enlarges and matures, with a 200% increase in activity expected within the next few years. The LDKT program will expand as more emphasis is placed on our pretransplant practice, including the more liberal application of laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, which has now become a standard procedure at our WFUBMC is involved in a number of clinical research projects studying new immunosuppressive agents and regimens. In this chapter, we have presented our recent experience with KTX in the elderly, ECD kidneys, alternate day Thymoglobulin administration, valganciclovir prophylaxis, SRL conversion using daclizumab bridge therapy, and pancreas transplantation with portal-enteric drainage. We plan to initiate a number of new protocols in the immediate future, including desensitization of the highly sensitized patient, ABO incompatible transplantation, transplantation of the HIV-positive patient, steroid withdrawal and avoidance regimens, living kidney donation from the anonymous altruistic donor, paired kidney exchanges from living donors, and islet transplantation. WFUBMC remains the most active donor hospital in North Carolina, and a non-heart beating donor protocol has been successfully initiated at our facility. Although much has been accomplished, a number of challenges remain. We look forward to building on our accomplishments, confronting the challenges, and achieving a level of excellence that could only be attained by mutual commitment from a dedicated, multidisciplinary team."

Classification by cholestasis syndromes in adults (e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis) and in the newborn or children (e.g. alphal antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis) makes good sense. Decisive for the diagnosis are, depending on the disease presenting, a typical constellation of laboratory results, detection of autoantibodies, imaging procedures (e.g. ERC, MRI), liver biopsy where indicated, or suspected drug-induced cholestasis. Byway of treatment, ursodeoxycholic acid, an antibiotic in cholestasis, and liver transplantation in some cases, are possible options.

Several series have described a 0.5% to 1.4% incidence of bile duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The aim of this study was to report on an institutional experience with the management of complex bile duct injuries and outcome after surgical repair. Data were collected prospectively from 40 patients with bile duct injuries referred for surgical treatment to our center between April 1998 and December 2003. Prior to referral, 35 patients (87.5%) underwent attempts at surgical reconstruction at the primary hospital. In 77.5% of the patients, complex type E1 or type E2 BDI was found. Concomitant with bile duct injury, seven patients had vascular injuries. Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was carried out in 33 patients. In two patients, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and vascular reconstruction were necessary. Five patients, one with primary nondiagnosed Klatskin tumor, required right hepatectomy. Two patients, both with bile duct injuries and vascular damage, died postoperatively. Because of progressive liver insufficiency, one of them was listed for high-urgency liver transplantation but died prior to intervention. At the median follow-up of 589 days, 82.5% of the patients are in excellent general condition. Seven patients have signs of chronic cholangitis. Major bile duct injuries remain a significant cause of morbidity and even death after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Because they present a considerable surgical challenge, early referral to an experienced hepatobiliary center is recommended."

In the early phase of patient selection, previous gastric surgery has been considered a relative contraindication to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Between 1999-2003, in our clinic, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted on 3145 patients. Of these patients, 37 patients had gallstone, which occurred several years (mean 17.9 years) after gastric surgery for peptic ulcer (34 cases), gastric cancer (1 case) and hiatal hernia (2 cases). Surgical procedures that had been performed included Billroth I gastrectomy (14 cases), Billroth II gastrectomy (15 cases), truncal vagotomy and piloroplasty (6 cases), and Nissen (2 cases). On this group there were 19 chronic cholecystites, 17 acute cholecystites and one cholesterolosis with gallbladder polyps. One patient was diagnosed with gallstone in common bile duct, successfully removed preoperatively after endoscopic sphincterotomy. The laparoscopic approach was possible in 26 cases. The technical difficulty after Cuschieri was level III--26 patients and level IV--11 patients (reconversion). The mean operative time was 75 minutes. The postoperative evolution of the patients was good in 36 cases. One case had a biliary fistula. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 3.6 days for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and 9 days after conversion. The postoperative adhesions determine the main technical difficulty, but it proved to be a relative contraindication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones after gastric surgery. Clear visualization of anatomic structures and landmarks, and scrupulous hemostasis are needed to perform a safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy in these patients."

New insights into the molecular pathogenesis may influence choice of treatment modalities and provide avenues for novel therapeutic strategies for testing in the clinic. The survival rate of patients with all stages of disease is poor and clinical trials are appropriate alternatives for treatment and should be considered. Surgical resection, when possible, remains the primary treatment modality and can result in long-term cure. Less invasive techniques such as laparoscopy may reduce the rate of unnecessary laparotomies. The role of adjuvant therapy is re-emerging. Patients with unresectable and metastatic disease are incurable and optimal palliation is the goal. These patients may benefit from palliative bypass of biliary or duodenal obstruction if symptomatic. Pain associated with local tumour infiltration may be palliated with radiation, with or without chemotherapy, or with coeliac nerve blocks or local neurosurgical procedures. Chemotherapy with gemcitabine has modest objective response rates but has been shown to improve symptoms."

CD009323,0,15307493,0,Surgical treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts in the 2000's--laparoscopic approach.,"A pseudocyst presents as a cystic cavity bound to the pancreas by inflammatory tissue. Typically the wall of a pancreatic pseudocyst lacks an epithelial lining, and the cyst contains pancreatic juice or amylase-rich fluid. Today the mostly used definitions make a difference between peripancreatic fluid collections, pseudocysts after acute and chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic abscess as in the Atlanta classification system for acute pancreatitis. Distinction between pseudocyst and acute fluid collection leads to a better understanding of the natural history of peripancreatic fluid collections and facilitates the progress of the treatment of these two separate entities even though they are a part of a continuous pathological process. The presence of a well-defined wall composed of granulation or fibrous tissue is what distinguishes a pseudocyst from an acute fluid collection. A pseudocyst is usually rich in pancreatic enzymes and is most often sterile. Formation of a pseudocyst requires usually 4 or more weeks (many clinicians state six) from the onset of acute pancreatitis. The differentiation in the Atlanta classification between acute and chronic pseudocyst is important, but it invite to confusion. It is important to note that in the classification the terms ""acute"" and ""chronic"" refers to the pancreatitis behind the pseudocyst and not to the mode of symptomatology of the pseudocyst itself. This means that an acute pseudocyst may have be known for months, whereas a chronic pseudocyst in the next patient has been documented only a week or two."

A prospective study.,"The incidence of surgical infections after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is reported to be <2%, because of the minimal trauma due to this approach. We report the results of a prospective study of antibiotic prophylaxis in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, comparing ceftriaxone vs ceftazidime. From Jan 1 to Dec 31 2002 a consecutive series of 242 cholecystectomies were performed, consisting in 18 open cholecystectomies and 224 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, 7 of which (3.1%) were converted to open cholecystectomies for technical and/or anatomical reasons. One hundred and eleven patients received 1 g i.v. ceftazidime 1 h before surgery, and 105 patients 1 g i.v. ceftriaxone on an alternate basis. Thirty-nine patients (17.4%) with acute cholecystitis received at least one booster dose at the end of the operation; 30 out of 39 were given further therapy for 2-3 days, i.e. 1 g i.v. bid. Twenty-two patients treated elsewhere with ceftriaxone or ceftazidime before surgery were transferred to another prophylactic regimen. The final diagnosis in the laparoscopic cholecystectomy group was 219 bile stones, 3 adenomas, and 2 occult carcinomas. We had 4 complications (1.8% of 217 laparoscopic cholecystectomies), 2 of which were minor (infection of the umbilical access by S. aureus) and 2 major (1 biliary fistula [accessory duct] and 1 acute pancreatitis), both treated conservatively. Positive bile cultures (27 cases) were unrelated to the clinical course. The incidence of infections after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in our prospective series was <2%. Ceftriaxone is confirmed as the gold standard in biliary tract surgery, but ceftazidime was equivalent (no statistical difference between the two antibiotics, P=0.59 NS). Ultra-short prophylaxis is enough in most cases, except in cholecystitis. We found no correlation between positive bile cultures and surgical infections after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The umbilicus was the preferred site of infection in obese patients after the laparoscopic procedure. Major complications are usually related to technical pitfalls."
CD009323,0,15287636,0,[Identification of gallbladder pedicle anatomy during laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is widely accepted nowadays as the gold standard in the treatment of cholelithiasis. This new technique was initially associated with a significant increase in morbidity, and in particular in iatrogenic biliary injuries and arterial haemorrhages, perhaps due to a lack of knowledge of the ""laparoscopic anatomy"" of the gallbladder pedicle. In this technique the anatomical structures are viewed on a two-dimensional video monitor, and the dissection is performed with long instruments without manual sensitivity. Therefore, the laparoscopic surgeon has to deal with new anatomical views and must be aware of the possible arterial and biliary variants. In this review we describe our technique of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with particular reference to manoeuvres useful for identifying the various anatomical structures at the gallbladder hilum. In our opinion, it is mandatory to avoid cutting any duct if its identity has yet to be established. For this reason, we pay great attention to the anatomical dissection of Calot's triangle, in order to accurately identify the cystic duct and the cystic artery and any other vascular or biliary structures. Routine intraoperative cholangiography may be useful for identifying the biliary anatomy. When in doubt, the surgeon should not hesitate to convert the procedure to open surgery."
CD009323,0,15287601,0,New tools for laparoscopic division of the pancreas: a comparative animal study.,"We tested the hypothesis that the pancreas can be safely divided laparoscopically using non-suture devices. Twelve pigs were randomized into 4 groups: 1) laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) using an ultrasonic scalpel; 2) LDP using an ultrasonic scalpel with pancreatic stump suture reinforcement; 3) LDP using a 35-mm laparoscopic linear vascular stapler; 4) LDP using a prototype 35-mm radio-frequency laparoscopic linear vascular stapler. There were no serious complications related to distal pancreatectomy. All groups gained weight by postoperative day (POD) 14. Serum amylase, glucose, electrolytes and total bilirubin levels were measured preoperatively and on POD 1, 3, 7, and 14, and peripancreatic peritoneal fluid amylase levels were measured on POD 7 and 14; all remained normal in all groups. Fewer adhesions to the pancreatic stump were found in the ultrasonic scalpel groups as compared with the stapler groups.

Half out of them--493 cases (50%)--were laparoscopic interventions. All of the organ material was submitted to pathological examination. In 4 cases (0.4%), all females, the pathologist surprisingly unveiled the diagnosis of gall bladder carcinoma in the 3rd stage of evolution for all of them. None of the observations presented beforehand or per operative hints suggestive for a malignant affliction. Three patients associated multiple pathology such as acute pancreatitis (obs No2), common bile duct lithiasis (obs No3) and cholecysto-duodenal fistula (obs No4). The postoperative evolution of gall bladder neoplasia of the 4 cases studied was extremely fast, the patients soon being readmitted in our clinic for jaundice, subhepatic tumoral mass and liver metastasis, on average after 31 days after cholecystectomy.

The phenotype of virtually all neoplastic cells was consistent with that of Paneth cells, based on routine morphology and their strong positive immunostaining for lysozyme. Additional widespread positive immunostaining for carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19.9 supports a totipotential cell as the origin of such neoplastic cells. This case, therefore, represents a true Paneth cell carcinoma, as opposed to inclusion of occasional neoplastic Paneth cells into a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

CD009323,0,15270527,0,[Laparoscopic exploration of the common bile duct].,"Since the first laparoscopic common bile duct exploration in Hungary published in 1999 the authors use the technique themselves. We review and analyse our activity between 1 June 1999 and 31 August 2003. The minimally invasive approach was selected in twelve patients with obstructive jaundice for suspected bile duct stones. Eight of these patients underwent preoperative endoscopy, but either the number and/or size of stones or various complications prevented successful endoscopic stone extraction; five sphincterotomies--two followed by stenting--were performed. The four other patients did not consent to endoscopy. During surgery the biliary tract was visualised by choledochoscope (a bile duct endoscope with video connection) in four cases via the distended cystic duct and in eight cases via longitudinal choledochotomy. In one case there was no occlusion at all, in another one dilatation was performed because of a structure. In nine patients stones were removed either through the choledochotomy/cystic duct or by passing them into the duodenum. In one patient we converted to open procedure due to a stone impacted in the papilla of Vater. After choledochotomy intracorporal suturing and knot tying techniques were used to close the incision. On six occasions a cystic drain, three occasions a T-tube and on three occasions primary closure was used. Two bile leaks were treated by endoscopic stenting and in one patient a laparotomy was needed. There was no mortality. We believe that laparoscopic common bile duct exploration can be successful even in complicated situations."

The quality, reliability, and ease of use of such units has evolved rapidly, so that laparoscopic ultrasonography may now be performed on a routine basis. Laparoscopic ultrasonography allows the surgeon to look into the tissues being operated upon, thereby compensating for the inability to physically palpate such tissues. Thus, it has not only helped to mimic open surgery, but has also refined the current techniques of laparoscopic operations. With the increasing availability of equipment, as well as the training of surgeons in this modality, laparoscopic ultrasound is quickly becoming an essential tool for the surgeon aiming to take laparoscopic surgery to new frontiers."

The pancreas was exposed by dissecting the greater omentum, and the tumor was located by intraoperative ultrasonography. After division of the splenic artery, the pancreas, main pancreatic duct, and splenic vein were transected with an endoscopic linear stapler.

CD009323,0,15238890,0,"Laparoscopic surgery for pancreatic tumors, an uptake.","Laparoscopy is not universally accepted as the best approach for pancreatic tumor disease. It is considered an élite surgical approach especially because of the technical difficulties involved; and the highly trained surgeons that are required to perform these operations. In addition, long operation times and lack of reduction in length of hospital stay press for the use of the laparotomic approach instead of a laparoscopic one. Four major areas of interest have been focused on: pancreaticoduodenectomy, pancreas resection and enucleation, the increasingly important areas of diagnostic laparoscopy for staging of pancreatic cancer and laparoscopic palliation of unresectable pancreatic cancer. A review of the literature about laparoscopic management of pancreatic tumors disease has been examined: 14 laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomies, 93 pancreatic resections, 41 enucleations, 4 left pancreatectomies and 2 hand assisted enucleations have been described since 1994. The laparoscopic distal pancreas resection and enucleation appear to be the best treatment option for lesions located in the body and tail of the gland; conversely laparoscopy may not be indicated for lesions located in the head of the gland. The laparoscopic approach today, does not present advantages in terms of post-operative outcome and operation times than the laparotomic approach. The hand assisted approach may be helpful in difficult cases to facilitate the operation; it permits an easier and safer dissection still conserving a minimally invasive approach. Moreover, laparoscopy is also becoming the best approach for tumor staging and palliation, and many surgeons use the laparoscopy to obtain the most information with the minimal damage in a situation already compromised by a weakening disease."

In this article, we describe our current techniques for resection of pancreatic cancer, review operative palliation for unresectable cancer, and discuss several controversies in the operative management of pancreatic cancer including: 1) the role of extended lymphadenectomy, 2) pylorus preservation and 3) pancreaticojejunostomy versus pancreaticogastrostomy for pancreatic duct reconstruction."
CD009323,0,15238888,0,Surgical palliation in pancreatic cancer.,"The prognosis of patients with pancreatic carcinoma is poor. At the time of diagnosis, approximately 80% of patients are found to have an unresectable tumour, because of local spread or metastatic disease. Therefore, most patients will undergo palliative treatment, which is aimed at the improvement of the quality of life and the prevention of symptoms. The most important symptoms which are associated with advanced pancreatic cancer are pain, obstructive jaundice and gastric outlet obstruction. Controversy remains on the question whether these symptoms should be treated surgically or non-surgically. This review describes the best evidence (if possible randomised controlled trials) in recent literature on the palliation of most important symptoms and focuses on surgical palliative treatment options."

Percutaneous or endoscopic stent placement was performed in all patients to relieve biliary obstruction. However, stent dysfunction repeatedly resulted in re-stenting of the obstruction. Imaging techniques, as well as endoscopic brush pathology could not distinguish between a benign or malignant stenosis. Explorative laparotomy showed a new growth in all 3 patients, of which 2 were malignant. When obstructive jaundice occurs after surgery of the biliary tract for benign disease, the most likely cause is a benign stenosis. Percutaneous or endoscopic stenting is the treatment of choice. In case of unexpected and/or repeated stent failure, when a diagnosis cannot be made due to inconclusive imaging or pathology of the stenosis exploratory surgery should be considered, as malignant stenosis may be present."

CD009323,0,15202328,0,[Laparoscopic treatment of bile leakage from the Luschka duct after laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,"The possible reasons for bile leakage following laparoscopic cholecystectomy are the injury of the common bile duct, the insufficient treatment of cystic duct (non competent or non closing, or spontaneously removing clip, stumpnecrosis due to electrocoagulation near to clipp, rupture adjacent to the clipp) or the opening of an aberrant bile duct. The latter often may occur in case of the anatomic variation described by Hubert von Luschka (1820-1875) a German anatomist as the duct named after Luschka. In a favorable case the accessory bile duct closes by itself, but occasionally developing biloma and/or biliary peritonitis need to be operated on. The authors write about the case of a 52 years old female patient, who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and 3 days later the complication was averted through the application of relaparoscopy with intracorporal suture.

Computed tomography and ultrasonography demonstrated a right pleural effusion and a 10-cm unilocular hepatic cystic lesion with no solid component. These findings suggested a non-neoplastic cyst or cystadenoma. However, intracystic fluid aspirated had high concentrations of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen. Cytology of the pleural effusion demonstrated malignant cells. During exploratory laparo- and thoracotomy, a hepatic cystadenocarcinoma with invasion of the diaphragm and pleural dissemination was discovered. This case demonstrates that malignancy should be ruled out when a patient with an intrahepatic unilocular cystic lesion presents with atypical symptoms and findings, such as chest pain, pleural effusion, and high serum concentration of tumor markers. We believe that intrahepatic cystic lesions should be approached aggressively, including the use of exploratory laparotomy/laparoscopy to be certain that cancer is not present."

We experienced a 32-year-old woman whose initial symptoms were right upper quadrant pain and nausea only. The abdominal computed tomography, DISIDA scan, and upper and lower endoscopic examinations were nonspecific. Up to 48 hours after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, contrast emptying of GB was delayed, implying dysfunctional GB.

Plasma insulin-to-glucose ratio greater than 0.3 or C-peptide levels of 2 nmol/L or greater suggest insulinoma. Abdominal CT scan can exclude metastatic disease and identify uncommonly large islet cell tumors, but has poor sensitivity for localizing insulinomas; transgastric endoscopic ultrasound is the most sensitive technique. Palpation combined with intraoperative ultrasound identifies most tumors at operation and gives vital information about surrounding structures. If no tumor is found, blind distal pancreatectomy should not be performed, and the patient should be referred to an endocrinologist or endocrine surgeon for diagnostic confirmation and further localization. Laparoscopy is a viable alternative to open tumor resection; laparoscopic ultrasound can facilitate localization and guide safe resection."

In addition, the question of spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy is controversial. This report evaluates the feasibility and outcome of laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (LapSPDP) in 19 patients (17 women and 2 men) with CyNP. A prospective comparison was made between 11 consecutive patients (group I) with splenic vessel preservation (SVP) and 8 patients (group II) without SVP (Warshaw technique). This study used color-Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) as a tool to identify patients at high risk for postoperative splenic complications. The mean tumor size was, in both groups, 5 cm. In group I, with an intent-to-treat basis of SVP, only in 54.5% of patients the spleen was preserved with an intact splenic artery and vein; in the remainder, conversion to the Warshaw technique was required for intraoperative bleeding. Evaluation of intraoperative factors showed that the mean operative time was significantly shorter (165 vs. 222 minutes) and the mean blood loss significantly lower (225 vs. 495 mL) in the group of LapSPDP with the Warshaw technique. No patients required blood transfusion in both groups. The overall conversion rate was 0%. The overall rate of pancreatic fistula was 15% and it was classified as biochemical leak (no clinical symptomatology). Overall splenic complications were observed in 16.6% of patients but occurred only in three patients undergoing LapSPDP with the Warshaw technique; CDUS showed in 2 patients a focal splenic infarct; the third patient had an initial hospital stay of 5 days, was readmitted 2 days later for a massive splenic necrosis, and splenectomy was performed. The overall hospital stay was 5.7 days. At mean follow up of 22 months (range 6-42), there have been no local recurrences."

CD009323,0,15106630,0,Symptomatic cholecystolithiasis after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"A 45-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of upper abdominal pain. Seven months earlier a laparoscopic cholecystectomy had been carried out and a solitary gallstone removed together with the gallbladder. The patient now suffered from pain of the same character but lower intensity compared to the situation before the operation. At admission there were no abnormal laboratory findings, especially no signs of infection or cholestasis. Ultrasound revealed a stone in a gallbladder-like structure in the right epigastric region. ERCP revealed an inconspicuous cystic duct stump and no pathological findings in the extra- and intrahepatic bile ducts. MRCP and CT showed a cyst-like structure in the gallbladder region containing a concrement. The patient was transferred to the Department of Surgery for exploratory laparotomy, and a residual gallbladder with an infundibular gallstone was removed. The recurrent upper abdominal pain was obviously caused by a gallstone redeveloped after incomplete laparoscopic gallbladder resection. Retrospectively it could not be discerned whether a doubled or a septated gallbladder was the reason for the initial incomplete resection."
CD009323,0,15105650,0,In situ and invasive adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder extending into or arising from Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses: a clinicopathologic study of 49 cases.,"We report 49 cases of gallbladder carcinomas that extended into or originated from Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses (RAS), all of which were resected by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Twenty-one tumors were in situ carcinomas that extended along RAS; six in situ carcinomas arose in adenomyomatous hyperplasia and 22 were invasive adenocarcinomas with extension into RAS. Thirty-seven patients were women and 12 men. Forty patients had cholelithiasis. The age of the patients ranged from 55 to 84 years (mean 67 years). All in situ carcinomas were incidental microscopic findings in gallbladders removed for cholelithiasis and/or cholecystitis. No patient with in situ carcinoma died as a result of the tumor, including two with in situ carcinoma that originated in adenomyomatous hyperplasia and showed microinvasion. In contrast, of 15 patients with invasive well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma extending into RAS and invading the muscle layer or subserosal connective tissue, 8 died 2 to 4 years after surgery. Seven patients survived 1 to 8 years after cholecystectomy. Useful clues to separate RAS with in situ carcinoma from tubular neoplastic invasive glands were the following: connection of the epithelial invaginations to the surface epithelium, recognition of normal biliary epithelium admixed with neoplastic epithelium, presence of inspissated bile in long dilated spaces, and lack of invasion to the smooth muscle bundles. In situ carcinoma spreading along RAS consisted of long tubular often dilated structures extending through the intermuscular connective tissue, whereas neoplastic glands were usually small or of medium size that invaded smooth muscle bundles or intermuscular connective tissue. Perineural invasion was seen only in invasive glands located in the subserosal connective tissue. Two cases of in situ carcinoma that arose in adenomyomatous hyperplasia and three invasive adenocarcinomas that were composed predominantly of tall columnar mucin containing cells similar to gastric foveolar cells with varying degrees of atypia and cells with biliary phenotype bear some resemblance to intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma of the pancreas or to mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasm. Metaplastic pyloric glands often seen in the muscle layer and subserosal connective tissue maintain their lobular pattern and should not be confused with invasive glands. Our findings indicate that distinction of in situ carcinoma spreading into RAS from tubular neoplastic glands of invasive adenocarcinomas is crucial to determine prognosis in this group of patients with gallbladder carcinoma."

Isolation of the cystic duct is the first dangerous technique in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In conventional open cholecystectomy, the fundus-down approach (retrograde) is a more common procedure than the approach in the reverse direction. Similarly, the fundus-down approach is safe and has benefits of reducing common bile duct injury. We report the easy and safe contrivance for laparoscopic cholecystectomy with taping of the cystic duct followed by resection of the gallbladder with the fundus-down approach, performed for 500 patients. The identified cystic duct was ligatured temporarily with Teflon tape. Then, fundus of the gallbladder was isolated with the fundus-down approach except for Calot's triangle. The tape was used for pulling down the cystic duct and Calot's triangle was easily visible. The cystic duct was cut off only after the confirmation of no bile duct injury. Thanks to this tape procedure, there was no bile duct injury in our 500 cases. We recommend this tape ligature of the cystic duct with the fundus-down approach to decrease the incidence of common bile duct injury."

CD009323,0,15054526,0,Hydatid disease cured by minimally invasive therapy.,"Hydatid disease is relatively frequently encountered in general surgery services (4-5% of the total operated cases). The association of the hepatic and pulmonary localizations is quite common, but the involvement of more organs is rare. The asymptomatic rupture of the hydatid cyst in the peritoneal cavity is exceptional. We present the case of a 69-year old female patient who was hospitalized in the 1st Surgical Clinic for irritative dry cough, loss of weight (4 kg in the last 3 months), fatigue, itching and dyspnea. She had been hospitalized in a department of internal medicine for respiratory symptoms when, during X-ray investigation, an opacity was observed, which was suggestive for a pulmonary hydatid cyst. The abdominal ultrasound revealed a multiple hydatid localization (liver, spleen, lower right abdominal quadrant and hypogastrium) and the patient was sent to our clinic. The patient was treated with albendazole 10 mg/kg/day for 10 days before surgery. Surgery was performed by a minimally invasive approach, first by thoracoscopy and, in the same operative session, the other hydatid localizations were approached by laparoscopy. The parasiticide treatment was continued about 3 months after surgery, when the patient was hospitalized again in order to cure the splenic hydatid cyst. Postoperative evolution was complicated by a biliary fistula which resolved spontaneously in 10 days after the intervention. The postoperative hospital stay was 14 days. This case was unusual because of the paucity of symptoms in spite of the multiple abdominal cysts and because it was cured by a modern, minimally invasive approach."

CD009323,0,15039899,0,The cystic artery in human foetuses.,"The cystic artery varies in origin, course and number and it is important to recognise it during operative procedure. Insufficient recognition of its anatomical variation may contribute to a dangerous situation, especially during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. To prevent iatrogenic injuries of the vessels and bile ducts, correct preparation with clear identification of the anatomic structures is essential. Special attention must be given to the course of the cystic artery through the hepato-billiary triangle (Calot's triangle). The assumption of the present study was recognition of the vasculature of the gallbladder in human foetuses. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the origin of the cystic artery and its relation to Calot's triangle. In this study the cystic artery was most often (97.06%) a single vessel and only in one case (2.94%) was it a double vessel. It arose most often (82.34%) from the right proper hepatic artery, rarely from its trunk (8.82%) or its left branch (5.88%) and most rarely (2.94%) from the gastroduodenal artery. In all but one case the cystic artery coursed within Calot's triangle. Its exceptional course out of Calot's triangle concerned a cystic artery originating from the gastroduodenal artery (2.94%). The cystic artery most frequently (67.66%) runs behind the common hepatic duct, rarely (29.40%) over the common hepatic duct and most rarely (2.94%) on the left side of the cystic duct. In the material examined the cystic artery was not observed running in front of the common hepatic duct. The short type of cystic artery trunk (52.93%) was observed more frequently than the long one (44.13%)."
CD009323,0,15036195,0,Management of complex biliary tract calculi with a holmium laser.,"The difficulty in managing complex biliary tract calculi is exemplified in patients with primary intrahepatic calculi. Standard surgical and endoscopic approaches often fail to clear calculi in these patients who have recurrent episodes of cholangitis. The success of the holmium laser for urologic calculi led us to adapt treatment strategies for primary and secondary biliary tract calculi where standard treatments had been unsuccessful. Our goals were to remove all calculi, prevent recurrent sepsis, and preserve hepatic parenchyma. Thirty-six patients with complex biliary calculi were treated. After sepsis was controlled and the extent of calculi was evaluated, appropriate access to and drainage of the biliary tract was achieved. Holmium laser lithotripsy was performed under video guidance using flexible choledochoscopes and a 200 micro laser fiber generating 0.6 to 1.0 joules at frequencies of 6 to 10 Hz. Lithotripsy procedures were repeated until cholangiography and cholangioscopy confirmed the clearance of calculi. Twenty-two patients of Asian descent with primary intrahepatic calculi and 14 patients with secondary intrahepatic calculi were treated. Access to the biliary tract could be accomplished through percutaneous catheter tracts, T-tube tracts, or the cystic duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Biliary drainage was by biliary enteric anastomosis or endoscopic sphincterotomy. Complete stone clearance required an average of 3.9 procedures (range 1 to 15) for patients with primary intrahepatic calculi and 2.6 procedures (range 1 to 10) for patients with secondary intrahepatic calculi regardless of stone composition. No patient required hepatic resection and no complications or deaths were attributed to the holmium laser. Clearance of calculi can reliably and safely be achieved with a holmium laser regardless of stone composition or location while preserving hepatic parenchyma and preventing recurrent sepsis."

LJ is an alternative form of therapy, with restricted indications to the few cases when classical way for EN (nosogastroenteral tube feeding, PEG/PEJ, surgical gastrostomy), are contraindicated or can not be used, and the patient is unable to eat. This technique is also preferred to the open surgical jejunostomy. The paper describes our LJ technique, indications and contraindications. We used JL in two surgical severely malnourished patients, within 11 and 14 days, before the elective, open, curative operations. In this period the patients where exclusively nourished with special feeding solutions through the LJ catheter. The main pathologic lesions were: extrinsec antral obstruction from a perforated transverse colon carcinoma in the omental pouch, in the first case, and proximal inflammatory stenosis of efferent loop, after gastric resection with Billroth II anastomosis for duodenal ulcer, in the second case. LJ gives the opportunity for the exploration of the whole abdominal cavity, and for the direct imaging of the pathological lesions. With EN being delivered before the open, elective operations, we get an amelioration of serum albumin values, and we have no morbidity related to the LJ or open, curative operation. EN was administrated after open surgery in the same way, and in the first case, during chemotherapy. LJ is an efficient, miniinvasive way for EN, in selected surgical severe malnourished patients with proximal digestive obstructions, especially oncologic ones, the aim being an amelioration of the nutritional status and a reduction of postoperative morbidity. A continuous study on a larger number of cases is imperative necessary."

CD009323,0,14973676,0,Endoscopic repair of gastrostomy after inadvertent removal of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.,"Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement has become the preferred method of enteral feeding for many patients. Neurologic disease and cancer are the most frequent indications for PEG tube placement. PEG tubes are also becoming more frequent in trauma patients for early initiation of enteral feeding. Inadvertent PEG tube removal is a well-known complication of PEG tubes. Patients undergoing PEG tube placement are frequently malnourished and in poor general medical condition, making them relatively high risk for surgical intervention. In the past, after early inadvertent PEG removal, patients underwent laparotomy for surgical repair of the gastrostomy site. Recently, laparoscopic replacement of the PEG tube has been described. We present a new technique of endoscopic repair of the gastrostomy site with hemoclip placement followed by later PEG tube placement."

In view of the development of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues and advances in laparoscopic surgery, we wished to determine whether more consultants are considering these methods for achieving ovarian suppression than radiotherapy. A questionnaire was designed to determine the current practice of consultants in the UK and to discover who is involved in making this decision. It was distributed via the Adjuvant Breast Cancer (ABC) trials office to consultants who enter patients into the ABC premenopausal trial. Seventy-four (72%) questionnaires were analysed. The preferred method of treatment was radiotherapy in 60%, surgery in 30% and LHRH analogues in 9%. Seventy-three per cent of consultants were using more than one technique but did not always involve the patient in the decision-making process to determine which treatment modality to use. Radiotherapy techniques used included using bony landmarks for field borders (46%), using a standard field size (20%) or using ultrasound localization (15%)."

CD009323,0,14959732,0,Laparoscopic transduodenal papillosphincteroplasty.,"In the past 20 years, the approach to biliary lithiasis has changed tremendously as a result of advances in endoscopic and laparoscopic techniques. The two most important open surgical techniques involve extraction of the stones from the common bile duct combined with choledochoenterostomy and papillotomy followed by transduodenal papillosphinteroplasty. Ideally, the choledochotomy is followed by the insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct. The transcystic approach has never been considered. The first endoscopic papillotomy was performed in 1973. Subsequently, it became the most widely used method for removal of common bile duct stones. In this report we explore the possibility of performing a laparoscopic transduodenal papillosphincteroplasty, following the strict rules commonly used in surgery. After cholecystectomy, a Fogarty catheter, is introduced through the cystic duct. This is followed by a minimal duodenotomy, then incision of the papillar sphincter. In this surgical proposal, we do not intend to substitute technique, but this method should be considered the ultimate solution in the laparoscopic approach to cholecystic choledocholithiasis."

Conversion rate was 2.02% (161 cases) and 6 (0.07%) death were encountered. Intraoperative hemorrhage (2.43%) could be controlled by intraoperative haemostasis in all but 8 patients (bleeding from the hepatic bed and from the cystic artery) which required conversion. Lesions of the bile ducts occurred in 16 patients (0.2%), 13 of them being identified during the operation and solved by conversion or laparoscopic choledochorraphy (for a tangential lesion). Postoperative complications required re-intervention in 45 patients: 11 for bile leak, 19 for choleperitoneum, 6 for hemorrhage, 4 for subhepatic abscesses and 5 for remnant CBD lithiasis. There was 1 puncture of the Douglas pouch in a case of choleperitoneum, 7 laparoscopic re-interventions and 25 open surgery re-interventions. EST solved postoperative bile leaks (from the gallbladder bed) successfully in 7 cases and remnant CBD lithiasis (5 cases). So, 44% of the cases were treated by minimally invasive means (laparoscopic re-interventions or endoscopic procedures). The majority of the incidents and postoperative complications were linked to the presence of an acute cholecystitis and were partially due to some technical limits of the laparoscopic technique of the gallbladder bed peritonisation. The minimally invasive treatment of postoperative complications, was very efficient and offered optimum healing conditions."

This malignancy ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States in 2003, with an estimated 30,700 new cases to be diagnosed and 30,000 deaths. Although gains have been achieved in the clinical management of these patients, this malignancy is rarely curable. Long-term survival is limited to patients undergoing resection. For patients with localized but unresectable malignancy, radiation therapy combined with fluorouracil, gemcitabine (Gemzar), or paclitaxel has shown modest improvements in survival and symptom palliation. However, there has been significant progress in the diagnostic evaluation of pancreatic cancer patients, which has aided clinicians in caring for these patients and in selecting therapies. The use of computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasonography, and laparoscopy techniques will be discussed. Newer techniques of radiation therapy, such as intraoperative electron-beam radiation therapy and three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, with the integration of new biologically targeted agents may provide new avenues of research and progress in this disease."

CD009323,0,14653028,0,"Liver resection for noncolorectal, nonneuroendocrine metastases.","In noncolorectal, nonendocrine liver metastases, the role of surgery is less define than in colorectal or neuroendocrine cancer. This role is marginal as liver is not the primary site of metastases of these cancers. Less than 2 to 5% of the patients with these malignancies might be one day considered as potential candidates for liver resection, as most patients suffer from extra hepatic tumour spread at the time they develop liver involvement. However, in these few cases with liver metastases only, as no other therapeutic option may provide mid- or long-term tumour-free survival, liver resection is indicated in resectable liver metastases. Some prognostic factors have been established in the literature from the few published series: unique versus multiple hepatic metastases, unilobar vs bilobar, metachronous vs synchronous, R0 vs R1 or R2 liver resections. The type of primary tumour is also of great importance, as cutaneous melanoma, pancreatic and gastric adenocarcinoma have a very bad prognosis for liver resection of metastases, even after R0 resection. In these cases, percutaneous or laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation may find its place. In sarcoma, breast carcinoma, uveal melanoma, and genitourinary cancers, liver resection may provide satisfactory long-term results in selected cases, and is the standard of care for isolated, resectable metastasis. However, due to the scarcity of indication of liver resection for noncolorectal, nonneuroendocrine metastases, the decision should be multidisciplinary, and the patients should be informed of the advantages and pitfalls of the surgical procedure."

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 612 videolaparoscopies in children aged between 8 days and 17 years treated from November/95 to 2000. Basic principles of videolaparoscopy and the postoperative management of several pediatric diseases are described. The results, advantages, and complications were analyzed after a 5-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Laparoscopic surgery allowed for a wide series of abdominal procedures conventionally carried out through open surgery, mainly for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, inflammatory acute abdomen, adhesive intestinal obstruction, biliary lithiasis, tumors, cryptorchidism, ovarian diseases, splenectomies, aganglionosis, trauma and others. Morbidity was low (1%), and mortality due to laparoscopy was nonexistent. Conversion to laparotomy occurred in only 14 cases (2.3%), mainly because of trauma. The principal advantages included minimal surgical trauma, pain and reflex ileum, short hospital stay, almost no incisional hernias and better cosmetic scars. CONCLUSIONS: Videolaparoscopy seems to be a great advance in modern pediatric surgery, allowing safer and less invasive treatment of a wide series of abdominal diseases at all pediatric ages."

CD009323,0,14618953,0,Laparoscopic surgery for cancer: are we ready?,"Following feasibility studies more and more large prospective reports even randomised trials document the treatment of digestive cancer using a laparoscopic approach. While the spectre of port-site recurrences, once so alarming has faded, it has become a challenge for laparoscopic surgeons to provide long-term follow-up. There is good class II and III evidence that staging laparoscopy (SL) has a value for oesophageal, gastric, pancreatic and hepatobiliary cancer as well as for intra-abdominal lymphomas since it adds to primary staging and often alters the clinical stage of the disease and hence the management of the individual patient. For minimally invasive oesophagectomy and gastric cancer surgery several series have demonstrated shorter perioperative morbidity and hospital stay however at present most studies report smaller numbers of selected patients and long term follow up is rare. The laparoscopic resection of pancreatic malignancies is not reported to be feasible, safe or potentially beneficial for the patient while the curative resection of suspected early gallbladder cancer is a poor indication. Nevertheless laparoscopy is documented to be safe and applicable for small malignant liver lesions and the Lacy trial was significantly in favour of laparoscopy-assisted colectomy, predominantly for stage III disease. Bearing in mind that in many fields of digestive cancer surgery, laparoscopy should still be conducted as part of a trial, it is safe to say that ""we are ready"" for this revolution to arise."

An enlarged cystic node can thus be used as an endpoint in the dissection of the Calot triangle."
CD009323,0,14614198,0,Pancreatic surgery in the laparoscopic era.,"Recent advances in technology and techniques have opened the gates widely to a wide range of applications of minimally invasive surgery in patients with inflammatory and neoplastic diseases of the pancreas. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard treatment for prevention of further attacks of acute biliary pancreatitis. Bile duct calculi detected at intraoperative cholangiography in patients with mild attacks of pancreatitis may be safely managed with laparoscopic bile duct exploration. Laparoscopic internal drainage of large, persistent and symptomatic pancreatic pseudocysts is safely applicable to most patients, achieves adequate drainage and facilitates debridement, and brings recognised benefits over open surgery and endoscopic approaches. Laparoscopic pancreatic necrosectomy for infected necrosis is feasible in some patients but the benefits of this approach in this high-risk group of patients remain to be shown. Staging laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound avoids unnecessary laparotomy in approximately one-fifth of patients with pancreatic cancer, but their routine application in patients with ampullary and duodenal cancers is not warranted. The majority of patients with periampullary cancer have locally advanced or metastatic disease at presentation and their management is entirely palliative. Laparoscopic surgery therefore has its place in the relief of biliary and gastric outlet obstruction, and has its advantages over endoscopic biliary and duodenal stenting in patients with predicted better prognosis, though these advantages ought to be confirmed in randomised controlled trials. Thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy is beneficial in the short-to-medium term for the palliation of intractable opiate-dependent abdominal pain of locally advanced pancreatic cancer and that of chronic pancreatitis with demonstrable improvements in quality of life. Laparoscopic enucleation of neuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas, and distal or subtotal pancreatectomy with or without preservation of the splenic vessels and spleen for neuroendocrine and cystic tumours, and in some patients with chronic pancreatitis is feasible and safe. In experienced hands, this minimally invasive approach reduces postoperative hospital stay and expedites recovery. However, the incidence of pancreatic fistula following distal resection is not any less than that of open surgery. Although the previous limited experience with laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy was discouraging, the recent experience with the hand-assisted approach is quite favourable and is likely to expand."

We report a 55-year-old woman with cystic adenoma in the area of the corpus who was treated with complete laparoscopic corpus resection while preserving the head and tail of the pancreas and the spleen. The patient was placed in lithotomy position. Four trocars were placed. After opening the bursa, the pancreas showed a 6x6x6-cm, well-bordered, cystic tumor in the corpus. Tail and head of the pancreas were free of tumor and seemed inconspicuous. After exploration of the v. porte and v. lienalis, the healthy tissue in the head area of the pancreas was divided with the linear stapler. Preparation continued in the direction of the pancreatic tail while preserving the v. lienalis. After reaching the healthy pancreas in the tail region, the tumorous segment was resected. The resected pancreas segment was placed in an endobag until removal over a slightly widened trocar incision above the symphysis. The tail segment was anastomized in situ end-to- side with the first jejunum loop behind the Treitz's ligament. There was no postoperative complication, and the postoperative course was observed.

Therefore, laparoscopic or laparoscopically assisted procedure would be an adequate choice of treatment for cystic tumors of the pancreas. Hand-assisted laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with preservation of the spleen and the splenic artery and vein was performed for two cases of pancreatic cystic tumors. Three ports and one hand port were used. After careful dissection and accurate hemostasis between the pancreas and splenic vessels, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was carried out using an endoscopic linear stapler. There were no perioperative complications. The pathological diagnoses were oligocystic serous cystadenoma and solitary cystic serous cystadenoma, respectively.

A laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy was performed. We used four trocars, and the operative time was 240 min. Conversion to open surgery was not necessary. The boy's postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged on the 6th day. CT-scan control at 6 months was normal. This case shows that even in advanced surgical cases, such as spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy, laparoscopic procedures can be done safely, within a reasonable operative time, in children."
CD009323,0,14598140,0,Laparoscopic resection for nonfunctioning small glucagon-producing tumor: report of a case and review of the literature.,"Glucagonoma is a relatively rare type of pancreatic endocrine tumor, and is often well-developed and malignant at detection. We report a case of nonfunctioning small glucagon-producing tumor that was successfully resected by laparoscopic surgery. A 63-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for further examination of a pancreatic tumor that had been detected incidentally. Hematological data and hormone concentrations were within normal ranges. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a small mass in the body of the pancreas. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was done. Macroscopically, the resected tumor was a yellowish-white, solid mass measuring 8 x 8 x 7 mm. The tumor cells showed positive immunohistochemical staining for chromogranin A and glucagon. The postoperative course was uneventful. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of laparoscopic surgery for a nonfunctioning small glucagon-producing tumor. Because of recent improvements in laparoscopic surgery technique, use of this approach for resection of pancreatic benign small endocrine tumors will likely increase in the future."
CD009323,0,14592669,0,Laparoscopic enucleation of solitary true pancreatic cyst in an adult.,"Solitary or true pancreatic cyst is a very rare pathologic condition; only a few cases are reported in literature. We report a case of a 22-year-old woman with a symptomatic true pancreatic cyst located in proximity to the pancreatic head, duodenum, vena cava, biliary tree, and right kidney, which was enucleated through a laparoscopic approach. Laparoscopic ultrasound imaging allowed the surgeon to better identify the morphology of the cyst and its relationship with the adjacent structures. The treatment is briefly reviewed and discussed."
CD009323,0,14584772,0,Management of common bile duct stones: the state of the art in 2000.,"Biliary lithiasis is a widespread disease all over the world; one-third of the white population presents with stones in the biliary ducts. In Chile, it is present in 47% of adult females. The most common complications of this pathology are acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, acute pancreatitis, retained common bile duct (CBD) stones, and gallbladder cancer; these constitute a serious health problem in Chile. The aim of this study was to update the information related to choledocholithiasis after 10 years of laparoscopic biliary surgery. To achieve this objective, we retrospectively analyzed the last 100 cases of choledocholithiasis admitted to the University of Chile Clinical Hospital in 2000. Prevalence by sex and age was determined. Clinical diagnosis was demonstrated to be effective in 92.3% of the cases; laboratory tests and ultrasound were effective in 81% and 90% of the cases, respectively. Diagnosis of cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis as one unique entity corresponded to 53% of the sample; 47% of the remaining choledocholithiasis cases corresponded to retained CBD stones in patients previously cholecystectomized. Time of appearance of symptoms of this residual pathology was reviewed. All methods or procedures employed to treat this pathology were studied, and it was found that endoscopic cholangiography (ERCP) was the most frequently used procedure. Also, results of other alternative procedures, such as open surgery or ERCP combined with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, were considered. Finally, this study was complemented with a thorough bibliographic review of more than 100 publications on the subject that were published in high-impact surgical reviews, emphasizing the course of treatment followed during the last 7 years."

A 76-year-old woman with situs inversus presented with fever and rigors. She had previously undergone endoscopic sphincterotomy and lithotomy for choledocholithiasis, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystolithiasis. Laboratory examination revealed hyperbilirubinemia and transaminasimia. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage, percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy, percutaneous transhepatic portography, percutaneous transhepatic portal embolization, and visceral angiography were performed without complications. She underwent right hepatic lobectomy, caudate lobectomy and extrahepatic bile duct resection for papillary adenocarcinoma of the proximal bile duct. Full investigation of the anatomical relationships between the biliary tree and the vascular system in the hepatic hilus enabled safe hepatectomy in a patient with situs inversus."
CD009323,0,14571167,0,Unique features of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in Beta thalassemia patients.,"Beta Thalassemia patients suffer from a high incidence of gallstones as well as systemic complications of iron overload. We performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 8 beta thalassemia patients and describe their specific features. Diagnosis was based on patients' clinical presentation and sonography. Trocars were readjusted due to the hepatomegaly. No intraoperative cholangiograms were performed. Follow-up included clinical assessment and abdominal sonography. All procedures were completed laparoscopically. Pigment cirrhosis and fibrosis around the cystic duct were noted in all patients. No biliary injury occurred. Post operatively, 4 patients suffered fluid leakage through the trocar site, treated conservatively. No major cardiopulmonary complications occurred. During a mean follow-up time of 65 months, all patients are symptom free and without evidence of biliary lithiasis. Thalassemia patients are difficult and often high-risk patients. Improvement in anesthesia and monitoring enables better management of these patients. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be advised in carefully selected thalassemia patients."
CD009323,0,14571163,0,Hand-assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy for early gastric cancer.,"Laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy has been applied to the treatment of early gastric cancer in Japan. However, there have been few reports on the laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy mainly because of the difficulty of the procedure. Here, we report a series of cases where hand-assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomies were performed successfully. The mobilization of the greater curvature was performed laparoscopically. About 7-cm mini-laparotomy was made at the epigastrium and duodenal transection was performed with linear stapler. After dissection of suprapyloric and anterosuperior lymph nodes was performed through the mini-laparotomy, dissection of lymph nodes along the celiac artery, and the left gastric artery was performed by hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. Roux-en-Y reconstruction was performed through the mini-laparotomy. We successfully performed this procedure in 5 patients. The mean operating time and blood loss were 275 minutes and 177.5 mL, respectively. Hand-assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy is suitable and feasible for early gastric cancer."
CD009323,0,14569457,0,Robot-assisted laparoscopic choledochojejunostomy.,"Endoscopic stenting is the treatment of choice for palliative relief of biliary obstruction by a periampullary tumor. If treated surgically, a choledochojejunostomy and Roux-en-Y diversion is still performed by laparotomy in a large number of cases due to technical challenges of the biliodigestive anastomosis in the laparoscopic approach. Robotic systems may enhance dexterity and vision and might therefore support surgeons in delicate laparoscopic interventions. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of performing a laparoscopic choledochojejunostomy and Roux-en-Y reconstruction with the aid of a robotic system."

However, the real clinical benefit for the patients remains questioned. The best indication for a laparoscopic approach appears to be the resection of benign or neuro-endocrine tumors without a need for pancreato-enteric reconstruction (i.e enucleation or distal pancreatectomy). The use of the laparoscopic approach for malignant tumors still remains controversial. The benefits of minimally invasive surgery are clearly correlated with the successful management of the pancreatic stump. Pancreatic related complication rate (fistula and collection) is 15% when using pancreatic transection with a laparoscopic endostappler."
CD009323,0,14558977,0,[The role of minimal invasion surgery in the management of patients with gastric carcinoma].,"In the last decade, minimal invasion surgery (MIS) has been used in a great variety of diseases and clinical situations. In gastric carcinoma (GC), specific indications in various circumstances have been described. MIS is used to make a diagnosis, for clinical stage classification, and for respectability evaluation, allowing to design a suitable therapy for each patient, because effective neoadjuvant treatments (chemotherapy and radiochemotherapy) are available. MIS has also been used for surgical resection of gastric neoplasia, including endoscopic mucosal resection, wedge resection of gastric wall, subtotal gastrectomy, total gastrectomy or even lymphadenectomy. MIS is used for perform palliative gastrojejunostomy in patients with distal GC, as well as for gastrostomy or jejunostomy for enteral nutrition in specific situations.

CD009323,0,14558714,0,Liver cyst with biliary communication successfully treated with laparoscopic deroofing: a case report.,"A 71-year-old Japanese woman complained of right upper abdominal fullness and pain. Computed tomography revealed a huge cyst in the right lobe of the liver, measuring 16 cm in diameter. She underwent laparoscopic deroofing of the liver cyst. On operation, needle aspiration of the cyst yielded clear serous fluid without any bile contamination. However, after the cyst was deroofed with laparoscopic coagulating shears, bile leakage was recognized from a tiny orifice in the cyst cavity. A catheter was inserted via the orifice for cholangiography, which demonstrated a communication with the biliary tract. The orifice was easily closed with a laparoscopic suturing device. Operation time was 5 hours and 30 minutes, and blood loss was 300 grams. Pathological examination of the liver cyst was consistent with a simple cyst. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient has had no recurrence to date at 13 months. Laparoscopic deroofing is a recommended treatment for a liver cyst even in the presence of cystobiliary communication."

The jejunum is the most common site of extramedullary plasmacytoma of the gastrointestinal tract and its common complications are intestinal obstruction due to mass, gastrointestinal bleeding, and intussusception. A 68-year-old woman presented with intermittent postprandial abdominal pain, vomiting, and weight loss. Abdomen and pelvis CT revealed diffuse wall thickening of the proximal jejunum. Small bowel series and enteroclysis revealed a short segment stricture of the proximal jejunum. A 2 cm long jejunal stricture was detected on peritoneoscopic surgery. A pathology showed a solid mass beneath the submucosa grossly and malignant plasma cell infiltration microscopically. A immunochemical staining showed monoclonal kappa chain expression. A bone marrow examination showed only mild reactive plasmacytosis. Serum protein electrophoresis, skull and spine X-ray showed no specific abnormality, and urinary Bence Jones protein was negative."
CD009323,0,14532724,0,[A case of pheochromocytoma with hyperamylasemia].,"Pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-producing tumor of the chromaffin tissue, may present with various features. Herein, we report case of 66-year-old woman with pheochromocytoma accompanying hyperamylasemia and acute abdomen. She was admitted to another hospital due to myocardial infarction 5 months ago. At that time, pheochromocytoma was suggested on the basis of hormonal studies, but she refused surgical resection. When she came to our hospital, serum amylase level was 703 U/L. Subsequent studies revealed pancreatic type isoenzyme, and elevated lipase level. After normalization of serum amylase level, she undertook laparoscopic adrenalectomy. On pathologic examination, pheochromocytoma was confirmed. There are several cases of pheochromocytoma with hyperamylasemia. In general, the source of hyperamylasemia was thought to be pulmonary endothelial cells under ischemic damage caused by potent vasoconstrictive action of circulating catecholamines. In our case, analysis of isoenzymes and serum lipase level suggest that hyperamylasemia can originate from the pancreas. Thus, pancreatitis also should be considered when serum amylase level is elevated in pheochromocytoma."

A large intra-abdominal cystic lesion was found incidentally during renal ultrasonography in a 14-year-old girl. Imaging studies showed a 13 x 9 x 15 cm homogeneous cystic lesion with mild contrast enhancement of the wall. The cyst appeared to originate from the retroperitoneum, but was separated from the left kidney, ovary, and pancreas. At laparotomy, there was a cyst behind the posterior peritoneum of the descending colon. The cyst was successfully excised, and histopathology showed MCA. Although primary MCA in the retroperitoneum is extremely rare in children, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an intra-abdominal cyst, since it needs to be excised to eliminate the risk of infection, recurrence, and malignancy."

CD009323,0,14518401,0,[Controversies in surgical treatment of gastric cancer].,"Conservative surgery is performed for patients with early gastric cancer, according to the guideline proposed from Japanese Gastric Cancer Society. There are many kinds of operations, such as ordinary open surgery, laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy, laparoscopic intragastric surgery, pyrolus preserving gastrectomy, hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. Indications of the operations are various, but it is necessary to have standard indication for each procedure. Standard operation for advanced gastric cancer in Japan is D2 gastrectomy. Surgeons in Eastern world believed that D1 + alpha or D1 + adjuvant radio-chemotherapy are the standard treatments, because of high incidence of mortality and morbidity after D2 dissection. In Japan, D4 dissection has been performed for patients with nodal involvement, and the validity of D4 dissection is now studied by two randomized trials. Combined resection for T4 tumor is believed to be mandatory. However, the validity of pancreato-splenectomy to yield a complete clearance of No. 10 or No. 11 lymph node station is in controversial, because of high incidence of the postoperative development of pancreatic fistula, anastomotic insufficiency and abscess. There was no prospective study to confirm the effect of omentectomy. Patients with advanced gastric cancer showing a serosal invasion-diameter less than 2.5 cm have less risk of peritoneal recurrence. It may be valuable to perform randomized controlled study consisting of omentum-preserving gastrectomy and gastrectomy with omentectomy. Prognosis of patients with peritoneal dissemination was improved by intraperitoneal chomo hyporthormia and peritonectomy, and prospective studies should be done to compare the effects of systemic chemotherapy and regional chemotherapy combined with peritonectomy. Furthermore, effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cytoreduction with R0 resection should be confirmed by prospective studies."

CD009323,0,14505152,0,Techniques for difficult cases of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Our basic techniques for the management of difficult cases of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) are presented in this article. If access to Calot's triangle cannot be gained safely, dissection should be started at the fundus or body of the gallbladder (GB), rather than the neck (fundus-first method). In cases with a short and wide cystic duct, a transfixing suture should be applied for ligation instead of clipping. EndoGIA is useful for ligating and transecting this case to avoid a subsequent stricture caused by normal method of ligation. Intraoperative cholangiography should be performed near the neck of the GB in cases in which orientation is lost during dissection. More dissection should be performed in the direction of the junction of the bile ducts after orientation is regained. In cases with GB filled with stones accompanied by severe fibrosis, part of the GB is incised to remove the stones and expose the lumen of the GB. Confluence stones can be removed by placing an incision on the GB side of the junction of the duct. The incised part is closed with suture. A cystic tube (C-tube) is placed in the common bile duct through the cystic duct for decompression. In more difficult cases in which dissection cannot be started safely at any location, the body and the fundus of the GB are excised, and a drain is placed at the neck of the GB. Dissection can be carried out from the main surgeon's or the assistant's side depending on the situation, and cooperation between the two surgeons is mandatory to achieve safe LC in difficult cases. When performing the LC, one must have a low threshold for converting to open surgery if injuries cannot be managed safely."

Retrospective analysis of 12 cases.,Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is a rare variant of chronic cholecystitis characterized by severe proliferative fibrosis and accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in areas of destructive inflammation. The macroscopic appearance generally mimics a gallbladder carcinoma. Twelve cases of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis were identified from a retrospective analysis of the patient records of 770 cholecystectomy cases operated on in our department from January 1996 to October 2001. There were four men and eight women. Mean age of presentation was 52.5 years. Eleven patients had gallbladder stones. Seven patients had a history of acute cholecystitis and five patients of biliary colicky pain. Five cases were presented with obstructive jaundice and five with acute cholecystitis. Right upper quadrant mass was palpable in three patients. All patients underwent cholecystectomy. Open surgery was planned and performed in three patients. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was planned in nine patients but converted to open surgery in three cases. Nine patients had an uneventful postoperative course. One patient developed wound infection and one patient a postoperative pulmonary infection. One patient developed acute abdomen in the 2nd postoperative day and was re-operated for bile peritonitis. No mortality was seen in the series.

In pancreatic cancer subcutaneous therapy with octreotide decreases oxidative stress and carcinogenesis as well. However, it is still unclear, whether irrigation with taurolidine or octreotide after laparoscopic pancreatic biopsy reduces tumor growth in pancreatic cancer as well. In 60 Syrian hamsters ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma was induced by weekly injection of 10mg/kg body weight N-nitrosobis-2-oxopropylamine s.c. for 10 weeks. In week 16 laparoscopic pancreatic biopsy by use of carbon dioxide was performed (gr. 1, n = 20) with subsequent laparoscopic irrigation with taurolidine (gr. 2, n = 20) or octreotide (gr. 3, n = 20). In week 25 hamsters were sacrificed. Our results show that macroscopic visible primary tumors were found in only one animal of the taurolidine group (5.9%), compared to 42.1% in the saline and 62.5% in the octreotide group (P<0.05). Carcinomas were smaller after saline (6+/-23 mm(2)) than after octreotide irrigation (70+/-120 mm(2), P<0.05). In conclusion this study showed that laparoscopic irrigation with taurolidine after pancreatic biopsy inhibited tumor growth in ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma."

Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRPE), although technically demanding and associated with a considerable learning curve, has become the surgical procedure of choice in selected and specialized urological centers around the globe for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. However, a major drawback of LRPE is the transperitoneal route of access to the extraperitoneal prostate. The principal disadvantages of LRPE are potential intraperitoneal complications, such as bowel injury, ileus, intraperitoneal bleeding, intraperitoneal urinary leakage, intraperitoneal adhesion formation and concomitant small bowel obstruction. Endoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy (EERPE) is a further advancement of minimal invasive surgery as it overcomes the limitations of LRPE by the strictly extraperitoneal route of access combining the advantages of minimal invasive surgery with those of an extraperitoneal procedure. Based on our growing experience with this procedure, we have introduced several technical modifications, improvements and refinements including a nerve-sparing, potency-preserving approach (nEERPE) in an effort to further improve this minimally invasive procedure."

CD009323,0,12879689,0,[Laparoscopic cholecystectomy--accessory bile ducts].,"Modern medical technology (ultrasonography, intraoperative radiologic contrast methods, ERC, CT and NMR) help in performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and operative procedures on bile ducts. The safe performance of these operative procedures requires good knowledge of clinical anatomy. In spite of excellent laparoscopic visualization, perioperative lesions of vascular structures or extrahepatic (especially accessory) bile ducts during laparoscopic cholecystectomy are a frequent cause of intra- and postoperative complications. Therefore, we wish to point to the potential risk of running into accessory bile ducts on dissection within or around the cystohepatic triangle, which may entail some overlooked and untreated lesions."
CD009323,0,12874695,0,Prevention of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy stoma metastases in patients with active oropharyngeal malignancy.,"The implantation of metastasis of oropharyngeal or esophageal cancer to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) stomata is considered an uncommon complication, but it is being recognized with increasing frequency. The incidence of this complication is not known. Multiple theories of metastatic spread have been proposed. We describe a case following retrograde endoscopy via a PEG stoma site. A National Library of Medicine literature search was performed, and case reports and bibliographies were reviewed. We estimate the incidence of this complication as 1% minimum. Direct seeding of the site is the only reasonable hypothesis to explain this phenomenon. Health care providers need to be educated about this problem. Although there is no direct evidence that metastases are spread by direct contact, we believe that transgression of the active primary tumor during gastrostomy tube placement should be avoided. Laparoscopic gastrostomy tube placement provides a safe, effective, and minimally invasive method of enteral access, which avoids transgression of the primary tumor site, and may prevent stomal metastases in patients with active aerodigestive tract malignancies who require gastrostomy."

For fit patients without co-morbidity with mild cholangitis and CBD stones with a gallbladder in situ, the one-stage laparoscopic approach could be considered as an alternative in centers with sufficient experience. The results of both procedures are comparable. Open surgery is relatively safe. It has a high success rate, good/excellent long-term results, but is not very attractive for the patient and should not be used routinely nowadays. Therefore, the indication should be limited for management of severe complications after ES as perforations of the duodenum, large CBD stones and patients with Mirizzi's syndrome or intrahepatic stones with stenosis of the bile duct. ES as primary treatment for CBD stones should be followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 'fit' patients. In patients with malignant disease, particularly after repeated stent failure and subsequent cholangitis, bypass surgery should be considered in patients with a life expectancy of >3 months."

CD009323,0,12811656,0,Laparoscopic resection of type I choledochal cyst.,"Type I choledochal cyst is a rare saccular or fusiform congenital dilatation of the extrahepatic biliary tract. It is usually treated by laparotomy at which the cyst is completely excised and a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is performed to establish biliary enteric drainage. We report the laparoscopic excision and hepaticoduodenostomy of type I choledochal cyst in two girls aged 1 and 3 years. The entire procedure was performed laparoscopically using needlescopic instruments. A 7-mm telescope port was inserted at the umbilicus, a 3-mm port in the right upper quadrant, and a 6-mm port in left upper quadrant. An additional 3-mm fan-shaped liver retractor was passed through the abdominal wall without a trocar. The gallbladder and choledochal cyst was dissected and removed en bloc. The lower end of the common bile duct was closed with 5-0 polydioxanone. The duodenum was anastomosed to the common hepatic duct below the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts. There were no intraoperative complications, and the children were asymptomatic with no episodes of cholangitis at 6 months follow-up. Pediatric surgeons trained in advanced laparoscopic techniques including intracorporeal suturing can perform laparoscopic repair of choledochal cyst safely."
CD009323,0,12802660,0,Laparoscopic treatment of pancreatic insulinoma.,"Laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) have been proposed for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic insulinoma. We present for cases of pancreatic insulinoma approached by laparoscopy guided by LUS. In three cases, insulinomas were in the pancreatic body and in one case in the pancreatic head. All lesions were detected preoperatively by abdominal US and confirmed by computed tomography. Laparoscopy was performed under general anesthesia. LUS was performed using a 10-mm flexible probe. In two cases the adenoma was enucleated using scissors and electrocoagulation, major vessels were controlled using clips, and enucleation was completed using a 30-mm endo-GIA. In one case a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with spleen preservation was performed. In one case the adenoma was deep in the pancreatic head; minilaparotomy was performed and the adenoma enucleated. Patients were discharged in good health 5-7 days after surgery. The postoperative course was complicated in one case of enucleation by peripancreatic fluid collection that was treated percutaneously. Our experience confirms that accurate localization followed by excision of tumors via the laparoscopic approach constitute a significant advance in the management of insulinoma."

Descriptive series have shown high success rates of 82-100% for stent placement, and 75-100% of the patients experience relief of the vomiting and ability to eat semisolid to solid food. Reobstruction was seen in about 15% of the patients requiring a second stenting. Serious complications to the stenting procedure have been reported in case studies. It is recommended to perform randomized studies of stenting versus open and laparoscopic surgical bypass for malignant gastric outlet obstruction."
CD009323,0,12768860,0,National survey on cholecystectomy related bile duct injury--public health and financial aspects in Belgian hospitals--1997.,"Public health and financial aspects of cholecystectomy related bile duct injury (BDI) are highlighted in a National Cholecystectomy Survey carried out through 'datamining' the Federal State Medical Records Summaries and Financial Summaries of all Belgian hospitals in 1997. All cancer diagnoses, children < or = 10 years, cholecystectomies performed as an abdominal co-procedure or patients having undergone other non-related surgery were excluded from the study. 10.595 laparoscopic (LC) and 1.033 open cholecystectomies (OC) as well as 137 secondary BDI treatments (LC/OC) were included in the survey (total 11.765). Both LC and OC groups turned out to be significantly different as to distribution of patient's age and APR-DRG severity classes. Composite criteria in terms of ICD-9-CM and billing codes were elaborated to classify: 1) primary, intra-operatively detected and treated BDI (N = 30), 2) primary delayed BDI treatments (N = 38), 3) secondary BDI treatments (N = 137), 4) non-BDI abdomino-surgical complications (N = 119), 4) uneventful laparoscopic (N = 7.476) and 5) uneventful open cholecystectomy (N = 681). Complication rates, community costs of LC and OC groups, incidence of preoperative ERCP and/or intra-operative cholangiography as well as interventions for complications were studied. Incidence of cholecystectomy related BDI was 0.37% in LC, 2.81% in OC and 0.58% overall. Average costs amounted to [symbol: see text] 1.721 for uneventful LC, [symbol: see text] 2.924 for uneventful OC, [symbol: see text] 7.250 for primary, intra-operatively detected and immediately treated BDI [symbol: see text] 9.258 for primary delayed BDI treatments, [symbol: see text] 6.076 for secondary BDI treatments and [symbol: see text] 10.363 for non-BDI abdomino-surgical complications. In conclusion BDI with cholecystectomy reveals to be a serious complication increasing the overall average cost factor ninefold if not detected intra-operatively, in which case the raise is only fourfold. As a consequence BDI should be avoided by all means. In this respect 4 crucial surgical guidelines are emphasised."
CD009323,0,12751023,0,[Symptomatic cyst of the pancreas and asymptomatic bilateral phaeochromocytoma].,"Symptomatic cyst of the pancreas and asymptomatic bilateral phaeochromocytoma. HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 39-year-old woman was admitted to our department of gastroenterology with recurrent epigastrical pain. Ten years previously the diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-syndrome has been established. Two years before a germ line mutation in exon 3 of the VHL-tumour suppressor gene has been detected. The patient has a healthy son with a normal VHL-gene and four healthy siblings who had refused a genetic blood test. INVESTIGATIONS: At abdominal ultrasound at the head of the pancreas three 4 2 cm large cysts and in the region of the left adrenal gland a 2,9 2,7 cm large tumor were visible. MRI of the abdomen revealed in addition a 2,2 1,5 cm large tumour of the right adrenal gland. An asymptomatic biadrenal phaeochromocytoma was detected by elevated urine catecholamines and 123I-MIBG-scintigraphy. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The cysts of the pancreas were punctured under endosonographical control and analysis of the cyst fluid was not suspicious of a malignant cystic tumour. The patient had no further abdominal complaints. After oral treatment with the alpha-blocker phentolamine the biadrenal phaeochromocytoma was treated by retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery in an organ-sparing fashion. Postoperatively ACTH-stimulating test revealed a normal cortisol response. CONCLUSION: Adrenocortical function can be preserved by la-paroscopic adrenal-sparing surgery in bilateral phaeochromocytoma."
CD009323,0,12759671,0,[Is the laparoscopic approach appropriate for porcelain gallbladder?].,"Contrary to the fears raised in surgical publications of the 1950's and 60's, the prognosis of porcelain gallbladder is not automatically associated with an increased risk of gallbladder carcinoma. Two recent cohort studies have allowed a better definition of the appropriate therapeutic attitude for a patient with a calcified gallbladder. In cases of ""true"" porcelain gallbladder, i.e., the presence of complete transmural calcification of the entire gallbladder wall, indications for cholecystectomy are based on biliary symptoms, all the more so since choledocholithiasis is often associated with porcelain gallbladder. In the case of partial calcification of the gallbladder, i.e., focal plaques of calcification involving the mucosa, prophylatic operative treatment is indicated. In these cases, the incidence of malignancy is markedly increased (14 times that of a control population). Cholecystectomy can still be performed laparascopically as long as the rules for prevention of peritoneal dissemination of tumor cells are scrupulously observed--the gallbladder should not be opened nor bile spilled, the specimen should be placed in a bag for removal through the abdominal wall, the pneumoperitoneum should be evacuated with the trocars still in place and the specimen should be opened and examined after removal with immediate frozen section pathologic exam if there is any question of tumor."
CD009323,0,12759665,0,[Intraoperative cholangiography by laparoscopy. Why and how to do it?].,"Intraoperative cholangiography under fluoroscopic control is a fundamental step in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Its two principal objectives are delineation of the anatomy of the biliary tree, and detection of stones within the main bile duct. Cannulation of the cystic duct is possible in 90% cases. The ability to detect common duct stones is excellent and offers the benefit of treatment of choledocholithiasis with a single operative procedure. We encourage the systematic performance of intraoperative cholangiography because it permits a diminution of both the incidence and severity of injuries to the biliary ductal system."
CD009323,0,12757155,0,Vascular involvement in pancreatic neoplasm: a comparison between spiral CT and DSA.,"The principal criterion for resectability of pancreatic carcinoma is the assessment of vascular involvement. In a prospective evaluation the ability of Spiral CT Angiography (CTA) to detect vascular involvement in 50 patients with pancreatic carcinoma, was proved; DSA was performed later in all patients. In 20 patients, without vascular involvement, a complete concordance was obtained. Of 30 patients with vascular involvement, there was complete concordance between CTA and angiography in 22 patients and discordance in 8 patients. CTA was superior in 2 cases with periadventitial infiltration and in 5 patients with splenoportal confluence thrombosis. DSA was superior in 1 case with infiltration of the superior mesenteric vein. After surgical evaluation, sensitivity of CTA and DSA was 97% and 77%, respectively, and the negative predictive values were 95% and 74%. As compared to DSA, CTA is more rapid and less invasive and can be considered the modality of choice for preoperative work-up of pancreatic neoplasm."
CD009323,0,12752345,0,Review article: The advent of capsule endoscopy--a not-so-futuristic approach to obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.,"Capsule endoscopy is a new, wireless, endoscopic examination of the small intestine. To date, two small clinical trials have been reported utilizing capsule endoscopy in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, and have shown its superiority to push enteroscopy in diagnosing the cause of blood loss. No outcome studies have been reported. This paper proposes a change in practice guidelines for obscure bleeding. It is our opinion that, in the future, with the advent of wireless capsule endoscopy, the evaluation of patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding will be very different from the practice of medicine today. We believe that capsule endoscopy will become the first-line method for the evaluation of patients with obscure bleeding, once upper endoscopy and colonoscopy have been shown to be negative. In patients with active bleeding, capsule endoscopy will confirm the small bowel as the site of bleeding, providing a location, or, if the study is negative for the small intestine, may indicate that the bleeding is either colonic or gastric in origin. In a patient with active bleeding within the small intestine, the capsule will guide further evaluation and therapy. A patient with a small bowel tumour detected by capsule endoscopy will proceed directly to laparoscopic surgery. If the site of bleeding is identified in the proximal small bowel and there is no mass, push enteroscopy will be used to re-identify the site and cauterize it. A distal small bowel site will require surgical intervention, coupled with intra-operative enteroscopy. Should the patient be too sick to undergo surgery, medical therapy utilizing hormonal agents will be considered. A colonic site will be evaluated by colonoscopy. In patients with a more occult or intermittent type of bleeding and in those whose upper endoscopies and colonoscopies are negative, capsule endoscopy will be used similarly to identify a bleeding lesion and thereby direct subsequent testing or treatment."
CD009323,0,12739129,0,Use of multislice helical computed tomography cholangiography in the diagnosis of biliary disease.,"A recent advance in computed tomography (CT) technology, multislice helical CT, has enabled production of clearer three-dimensional (3D) images and has drawn interest. We report the usefulness of CT cholangiography using a multislice helical CT scanner for the diagnosis and preoperative imaging of the biliary duct in a case of peculiarly shaped gallbladder with cholecystitis. A 34-year-old woman admitted to our hospital presented with chronic hypochondralgia. A CT scan showed that the gallbladder was normal without wall thickening or stones. However, there appeared to be a tumor, containing a stone approximately 1 cm in diameter, attached under the gallbladder in front of the right kidney and extending up to its lower level. Magnetic resonance cholangiography also depicted a normal gallbladder without wall thickening or stones. Hence, gallbladder stones were not diagnosed by previously the mentioned investigations. In contrast, a 3D image produced by multislice helical CT cholangiography was very clear. From the bottom of the gallbladder, a narrow canal continued to a stone. We diagnosed that the wall of the lower part of the long gallbladder had become thick and elongated because of chronic cholecystitis caused by a gallbladder stone, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Macroscopically, the resected gallbladder showed an extremely thickened wall from the lower body to the fundus, in which a stone was located in the center. Multislice helical CT cholangiography has the potential to become one of the most significant examinations for diagnosis and anatomical analysis of biliary disease prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy."

CD009323,0,12732492,0,Recent advances in minimally invasive pancreatic surgery.,"For curative resection of pancreatic endocrine tumours, minimally invasive methods of pancreatic surgery, such as laparoscopy, should be indicated only for benign tumours. Among these uncommon tumours, pancreatic insulinomas are mostly benign and solitary. Successful management of patients with insulinomas relies on accurate localization of the tumour and the use of appropriate surgical techniques. Because of the small size of these tumours, conventional intraoperative ultrasonography combined with palpation has been widely regarded as the best localization procedure. Because contact ultrasonography, a new technique for localization of pancreatic lesions, can be used laparoscopically, several surgeons have used laparoscopy not only for localization, but also for resection of insulinomas. In the era of minimally invasive surgery for benign pancreatic lesions, we attempted laparoscopic-focused exploration of the pancreas for resecting insulinomas based on preoperative localization. We describe the use of this technique for the detection and resection of insulinomas and the results obtained, with a review of previous reports."

CD009323,0,12728385,0,Gallbladder duplication successfully removed laparoscopically using endoscopic nasobiliary tube.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is sometimes difficult due to complicated biliary anatomy including gallbladder duplication, a rare anomaly of the biliary tract. We report a case of duplicated gallbladder successfully removed under laparoscopy using endoscopic nasobiliary (ENB) tube cholangiography. A 61-year-old Japanese woman presented us with right upper abdominal pain. Ultrasonography revealed two cystic structures lying in the gallbladder fossa, and the upper one contained multiple stones. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed two gallbladders, each of which has a cystic duct draining into the common bile duct separately. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was planned under the preoperative diagnosis of double gallbladder with gallstones in the accessory gallbladder. The ENB tube was inserted just before the operation. Laparoscopic removal of the double gallbladder was successfully done using the ENB tube to identify the biliary tree anatomy and to close the stump of the cystic duct. In this communication, we would like to stress the usefulness of the ENB tube at the time of laparoscopic biliary surgery in patients with biliary anomalies including gallbladder duplication."

Considering the limitations of laparoscopic surgery, it is necessary to objectively evaluate whether laparoscopic surgery is associated with an improved quality of curative treatment. Therefore, controlled studies comparing the results of laparoscopic vs conventional cancer surgery are mandatory. To date, comparable findings on short-term outcome of laparoscopy with open resection can only be shown for colorectal cancer. However, long-term data including recurrence and survival are still missing as randomized studies (phase IIIb) are still to be completed. Consequently, laparoscopic curative resection should only be performed within controlled trials. In terms of the upper GI tract, minimally invasive surgery has proven to be technically feasible in expert centers including limited resections for early gastric cancer, left pancreatectomies, or hepatic resections for malignancy. Finally, laparoscopy has gained acceptance in the field of diagnosis (e.g., staging laparoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasound) and palliative treatment (e.g. gastroenterostomy, thermoablation) without the need for controlled studies."

The diagnostic methods were as follows: USE, CT, biochemical examinations of blood, urine and exudate. Percutaneous puncture contrast retroperitoneography (PPCR) was developed. It is demonstrated that modern diagnostic methods and PPCR permit one to diagnose PN, detect location, zone of retroperitoneal fat's necrosis and characterize its infection. The size of lesion of retroperitoneal fat in patients with sterile PN (n = 133) does not determine severity of the patients' condition and early lethality, but increases the risk of infection and makes worse prognosis of the disease. In laparoscopic sanation of the abdominal cavity for fermentative peritonitis, compared with laparotomic one, infection developed less rarely (10.2 and 40%, p < 0.01) and lethality decreased.

A quality of life questionnaire based on assessment of urinary continence and sex life and a PSA assay form are also included. The patient is therefore able to enter his PSA level and complete the questionnaire at home and the results are then sent to the doctor who treated him. A contact page allows the patient and the doctor to exchange information by text. 92 of these 100 patients connected regularly to the site with a mean connection rate of 8 per patient (range: 1 to 22). 98% of patients were satisfied with the various sections of the site and 95% were satisfied with their medical file. 11% of patients encountered connection problems and 14% reported technical problems essentially attributed to incorrect PSA data entry or incorrect functioning of videos due to the absence of appropriate software. This type of Internet medical service for patients who have undergone a surgical operation requiring regular follow-up appears to be a useful approach for the future by allowing: maintenance of close contact between the patient and his doctors while avoiding the problems related to hospital visits, regardless of the patient's place of residence. It also provides general practitioners with access to the patient's file, with the patient's permission."
CD009323,0,12666406,0,[Role of laparoscopy with ultrasound in the staging process of pancreatic and ampullary tumors].,"Computarized tomography allows proper identification and evaluation of stage in the majority patients with periampullary tumors. However, 30% of peritoneal metastases cannot be seen in image studies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasound in the staging process of pancreatic and ampullary tumor. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed on 20 patients included in the study Mean age was 58.35 +/- 13.4 years. Twelve were males and eight females. In two patients, laparoscopy showed peritoneal metastases and ultrasound did not show extrapancreatic involvement. In five patients, there was vascular invasion without metastases. In three patients, both peritoneal metastases and vascular invasion were found, and in five there was neither vascular invasion nor metastasis. Laparoscopic findings were confirmed in a but one patient. In 14 of the 16 patients In whom peritoneal lavage was performed, microscopic exam showed a sufficient number of cells to make a diagnosis. We concluded that laparoscopy with ultrasound is useful in staging of patients with duodeno-bilio-pancreatic malignancies."

CD009323,0,12658407,0,"Bile duct clearance, endoscopic or laparoscopic?","Endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) has become the gold standard nonoperative modality for the removal of common bile duct (CBD) stones. Morbidity is 2%-10%, and mortality less than 2%. Immediate complications include bleeding, cholangitis, pancreatitis, and duodenal perforation, but many of these can be prevented by using various tools, including an alternating coagulating and cutting diathermy unit, routine biliary stenting, frequent use of guide-wires to avoid precutting, and mechanical lithotripsy. Long-term results have shown that the stone recurrence rate reaches 15%, probably due to a strong recurrent tendency inherent to bilirubinate stones. Choice of the appropriate lithotomy modality is of paramount importance to reduce invasiveness. ES is the choice for recurrent or residual stones and for choledocholithiasis alone. Acalculous gallbladders left in place carry no risk of acute cholecystitis. In patients with cholecystocholedocholithiasis, CBD stones should be removed via the cystic duct or by choledochotomy during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, not to preserve the sphincter of Oddi but to reduce the interventional burden. Safety and safeguards of papillary balloon dilation must still be investigated in a limited number of institutions. Marked progress in lithotomy/lithotripsy procedures has almost obviated the need for laparotomy. Patients with CBD stones benefit from the less invasive and more efficient modalities of transpapillary, percutaneous, and laparoscopic lithotomy."
CD009323,0,12658405,0,Laparoscopic hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery: an overview.,"Although they are not widely employed, advanced laparoscopic hepatobiliary pancreatic (HBP) procedures can be performed. Laparoscopic common bile duct (CBD) exploration has gained wide acceptance, and endoscopic retro-grade cholangiopancreatography/endoscopic sphincterotomy (ERCP/ES) may become less important in the treatment of CBD stones. Choledochal cyst is another example that is suitable for laparoscopic treatment. It can be removed, and bilioenteric flow is reestablished laparoscopically. Simple cyst of the liver is an excellent indication for laparoscopic surgery. Cysts are unroofed, and recurrence is rare. Hydatid disease can also be treated laparoscopically. In liver resection, the use of laparoscopy is limited to wedge resection and left lateral segmentectomy at most. Laparoscopic staging for pancreatic cancer can demonstrate respectability in 90% of cases. This staging may obviate unnecessary laparotomy. Although laparoscopic Whipple is feasible, laparoscoic distal pancreatectomy is a realistic indication for pancreatic resection. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy may be indicated for cystic neoplasms of low-grade malignancy, and for islet cell tumors. When internal drainage is indicated, pseudocysts can be treated laparoscopically. If the cyst is located close to the posterior gastric wall, cystgastrostomy can also be achieved with an endoluminal surgical technique."

CD009323,0,12633038,0,Periumbilical veress needle pneumoperitoneum: technique and results in 2.126 cases.,"In laparoscopic surgery, a pneumoperitoneum is generally created either by direct puncture (Veress needle technique) or by the open (Hasson) technique. Some surgeons predominantly use direct access, reserving open access for selected patients; others consider the Veress needle as carrying an unacceptable risk of intestinal or vascular injury and consequently use only the Hasson technique. The database containing records of all abdominal laparoscopic operations performed in our institution was reviewed; over the period from June 1991 to December 2001 a total of 2,126 laparoscopic operations were performed, consisting in 1,457 (68.5%) cholecystectomies, 392 (18.4%) appendectomies, 177 (8.3%) varicocelectomies, 65 (3%) operations on the uterus and ovaries, 6 (0.2%) groin hernia repairs, 6 (0.2%) fundoplications, 3 (0.1%) ileo-colic resections for right colon cancer, and 20 (1.3%) diagnostic laparoscopies. The direct puncture technique was used in 100% of cases. The time needed up to connection of the video camera averaged 4-7 minutes. Twelve laparoscopic cholecystectomies were converted, with a conversion rate of 0.5%. Four patients were re-operated on, two for bleeding from the gallbladder fossa and two because of small bowel perforation caused by electrocautery. None of the patients sustained any clinically apparent vascular or bowel injury as a result of the blind access. There were no cases of preperitoneal or omental air insufflation. The mortality was nil. The authors describe their technique for gaining access to the abdominal cavity by direct puncture and conclude that properly performed Veress needle insertion is less invasive, safe and perfectly feasible in all patients."
CD009323,0,12631451,0,Staging strategies for pancreatic adenocarcinoma: what the surgeon really wants to know.,"Pancreatic cancer remains a highly lethal disease in spite of new developments in early diagnosis, marked improvements in surgical morbidity and mortality, and introduction of promising adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies. This ongoing poor prognosis can be explained in part by the relatively advanced stage of these malignancies at the time of presentation and diagnosis. The staging process in this disease lacks standardization and differs considerably from center to center. Acknowledging that it is impossible to achieve a perfect workup to rule out micrometastatic disease, controversy persists regarding the optimal initial approach and subsequent staging of these tumors. A better, or at least a more standardized staging system, should help to improve disappointing results in the surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer, although such an improvement will be based more on the selection of patients than the actual therapeutic intervention. This paper addresses the current controversy in staging methodology for pancreatic and periampullary malignancies and offers an approach to the staging of pancreatic cancer."

They may be localized all over the mesentery, from duodenum to rectum, however, they are mostly found in the ileum and right colon mesentery. There are several classifications of these formations, among which the one based on histopathologic features including 6 groups has been most commonly used: 1) cysts of lymphatic origin--lymphatic (hilar cysts) and lymphangiomas; 2) cysts of mesothelial origin--benign or malignant mesothelial cysts; 3) enteric cysts; 4) cysts of urogenital origin; 5) dermoid cysts; and 6) pseudocysts--infectious or traumatic etiology."

CD009323,0,12623362,0,Carcinoma of the gallbladder.,"Carcinoma of the gallbladder is the most common malignant tumour of the biliary tract and a particularly high incidence is observed in Chile, Japan, and northern India. The aetiology of this tumour is complex, but there is a strong association with gallstones. Owing to its non-specific symptoms, gallbladder carcinoma is generally diagnosed late in the disease course, but if a patient with gallstones experiences a sudden change of symptoms, then a cancer diagnosis should be considered. Treatment with radical or extended cholecystectomy is potentially curative, although these procedures are only possible in 10-30% of patients. There is no role for cytoreductive surgery in this disease. If a gallbladder carcinoma is discovered via pathological examination of tissue samples, then the patient should be examined further and should have radical surgery if the tumour is found to be T1b or beyond. Additional port-site excision is necessary if the patient has already had their gallbladder removed during laparoscopy; however, patients with an intact gallbladder who are suspected to have gallbladder carcinoma should not undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients with advanced inoperable disease should receive palliative treatment; however, the role of chemotherapy and radiation in these patients needs further evaluation."

CD009323,0,12607785,0,The role of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound in the diagnosis of cystic lesions of the pancreas.,"With the widespread use of advanced imaging techniques, cystic lesions of the pancreas are now diagnosed relatively frequently. The nature of these lesions vary from benign cysts (serous cvstadenoma) or an inflammatory process (pseudocyst), to premalignant (mucinous cystadenoma) or frankly malignant lesions (cystadenocarcinoma). Differentiation of various types of pancreatic cysts presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, as clinical presentation may be vague. Laparoscopic ultrasonography (LAPUS), the biopsy of the cystic wall, and analysis of the cystic aspirate, although expensive and rather invasive procedures, significantly contribute to the differential diagnosis of pancreatic cystic lesions."
CD009323,0,12607584,0,Surgical indications and extent of resection in gallbladder cancer.,"Gallbladder cancer often is diagnosed at an advanced stage when the prognosis is dismal. Early tumors (T1) that are recognized incidentally are curable with simple cholecystectomy alone. All other tumors should be resected with an extended cholecystectomy (T2) or with an extensive liver resection that obtains the negative margins. Patients with tumors greater than T1 should undergo lymphadenectomy that includes the porta hepatis and superior pancreatic nodes. Long-term survival with this approach is possible, even with T3 and T4 tumors. The role of extended lymphadenectomy, including the retropancreatic and aortocaval basins, is unclear and should be attempted only in selected cases."
CD009323,0,12607577,0,Role of laparoscopy in the evaluation of biliary tract cancer.,"Patients with malignancies of the biliary tract have a dismal prognosis. As in most abdominal cancers, resection is the only effective treatment with potential for cure. Preoperative staging is not completely accurate, however, and a significant number of patients with biliary carcinoma undergo unnecessary laparotomy. As imaging technology improves, more patients with unresectable disease will be identified, avoiding the need for a laparotomy. Laparoscopy is a major addition, but its usefulness in staging of abdominal malignancies continues to evolve. The importance of laparoscopy to better predict the resectability in liver malignancies increasingly has been recognized. Conversely, the use of staging laparoscopy for other cancers has shown little benefit. For hilar cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, the authors' analysis of 100 patients supports the use of staging laparoscopy for assessing these tumors. In this series, staging laparoscopy correctly identified unresectable disease and prevented unnecessary laparotomy in one third of patients. Patients with unresectable disease that was not detected at laparoscopy most often had locally advanced tumors. LUS did not contribute to the assessment of resectability in these patients. The yield of laparoscopy was lower for hilar cholangiocarcinoma, but could be improved by targeting patients who are at higher risk for occult unresectable disease, such as patients with T2 or T3 lesions. These patients and patients with primary gallbladder carcinoma have a high incidence of metastatic disease and should undergo laparoscopic staging before attempting at resection."
CD009323,0,12598755,0,Laparoscopic reintervention for residual gallstone disease.,"Laparoscopic reintervention is being increasingly performed in patients who have previously undergone surgery for gallstone disease. A few patients with gallbladder remnants or a cystic duct stump with residual stones have recurrent symptoms of biliary disease. Patients with bile duct injuries were excluded from the study. We reviewed our experience in treating such patients over a 4-year period, January 1998 through December 2001. Five patients underwent laparoscopic reintervention after previous surgery for gallstone disease performed elsewhere during the period mentioned above. Of these 5 patients, 3 had impacted stones in gallbladder remnants (laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 2; open cholecystectomy, 1) and 2 had recurrent symptoms after cholecystolithotomy and tube cholecystostomy (conventional surgery) performed elsewhere. Laparoscopic excision of the gall bladder remnants was done in 3 patients and a formal laparoscopic cholecystectomy was done in 2 patients who had previously undergone cholecystolithotomy and tube cholecystostomy. The mean operating time was 42 minutes. No drainage was required postoperatively. All patients were symptom-free during a mean follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 7 months to 4 years). Reintervention may be required for patients with residual gallstones whose symptoms recur after gallbladder surgery such as cholecystectomy, subtotal cholecystectomy, and tube cholecystostomy. It is safe and feasible to remove the gallbladder or gallbladder remnants in such patients laparoscopically."

Mean cystic duct diameters next to the gallbladder neck, within the valve and 5 mm proximal to the junction with the common hepatic duct were 1.95, 0.42 and 1.85 mm, respectively. Lateral cysto-hepatic junction was identified in 78.6%, spiral in 10% and parallel in 10%. In 90% cases the cysto-hepatic junction is within 4 cm of the hepatic duct junction. One case (1.43%) of cystic duct entering the right hepatic duct was identified. The valve of Heisteri consisted of three spiral turns in 73% of the cases with a range from 0 to 5. In 3/70 specimens the spiral valve did not exist."

We report an extremely rare case of a patient who had a bowel obstruction caused by an internal supravesical hernia that was repaired via a minimally invasive technique. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed signs of small bowel obstruction: the cause was thought to be an invagination due to a small bowel tumor. Laparoscopic exploration of the dilated small bowel segments allowed the diagnosis of supravesical hernia. Reduction was performed with slight traction, and the hernial orifice was closed with intracorporeal sutures. To our knowledge, this is the first repair of an internal supravesical hernia ever to receive herniorraphy based on laparoscopic techniques. The mean starting time for bowel-function and mean hospital stay following the laparoscopic release of the intestinal obstruction were significantly shorter than is typically seen with standard techniques."

CD009323,0,12548170,0,Loss of CD117 (c-kit)- and CD34-positive ICC and associated CD34-positive fibroblasts defines a subpopulation of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.,"Chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a syndrome in which symptoms of intestinal obstruction are present in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Lack of normal pacemaker activity, usually generated by the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), could account for the apparent obstruction. ICC are normally located around and between the myenteric plexus ganglia and within muscle and also in the deep muscular plexus of the small bowel and the submuscular plexus of the large intestine, just within the circular muscle. ICC can be demonstrated immunohistochemically with CD117 (c-kit) as well as with CD34, although this is less specific. CD34 also stains a population of fibroblasts that are intimately associated with ICC. To determine whether there is a relative deficiency of ICC and CD34-positive fibroblasts in patients with chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, tissue from 30 patients of large intestine and eight patients with small intestine pseudo-obstruction was obtained. Controls (large intestinal specimens from 12 patients, small intestinal specimens from six patients) were chosen from resections for Crohn's disease and colorectal neoplasia, both with and without dilatation. Examination of pseudo-obstruction cases identified 10 patients (nine large intestinal and one small intestinal) in which both CD117 and CD34 were absent or severely reduced in all three of the examined areas. In contrast, the control cases, including those with preobstructive dilatation, showed relatively constant ICC staining. These results suggest that there is a proportion of pseudo-obstruction cases in which the ICC are markedly reduced. These results also demonstrate that, in these cases, loss of the kit immunoreactivity is correlated with the loss of CD34 staining: this indicates that both the ICC and the CD34-positive fibroblasts associated with the ICC are absent. These findings will allow surgical pathologists to identify this subpopulation of patients with CIIP using tissue obtained by laparoscopic biopsy of the muscularis propria or surgical resection."

CD009323,0,12541045,0,Navigation and image-guided HBP surgery: a review and preview.,"Image-guided surgery and navigation have resulted from convergent developments in radiology, teletransmission, and computer science. Patient selection and preoperative planning in hepatobiliary-pancreatic (HBP) surgery rely on preoperative imaging. The operative procedure is finally led by the fusion of additional information gained by the palpating hand and intraoperative ultrasound. Despite advances in reducing morbidity and mortality, decisions are often hardly quantifiable and are restricted to super-specialists in HBP surgery. New developments in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology have led to the possibility of the volumetric prediction of liver resections. These data can be shared via telemedicine and used for simulation and training. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions have led to a better topologic understanding of tumor-vascular tree relations in the individual patient. With the increasing use of ablative procedures and laparoscopy, intraoperative imaging and navigation will hold increasing significance for the HBP surgeon. Flat screen monitors adjacent to the surgical field present computer-generated 3D virtual liver resection proposals which can be transferred into the real liver. The main obstacles in HBP navigation are the flexibility and mobility of the target organ. Intrahepatic and surface markers seem to be mandatory for computer-navigated surgery. The first feasibility studies are promising."
CD009323,0,12541039,0,Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery: its indications and techniques: from the viewpoint of limiting the indications.,"Indications in the field of pancreatic surgery should be limited considering the technical difficulties and the characteristics of pancreatic diseases. Benign or low-grade malignant tumors, including pseudocysts, islet tumors, and cystic tumors, are indications for distal pancreatectomy. Islet tumors such as insulinomas are good candidates for this procedure when they are located near splenic vessels or the main pancreatic duct and enucleation is considered inappropriate. Techniques of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with/without splenectomy and laparoscopy-assisted distal pancreatectomy indicated in low-grade malignant tumors such as mucinous cystadenoma are described. Insulinoma is one of the best candidates for enucleation because many of the cases are solitary and benign. The technique of enucleation is also described."

CD009323,0,12541037,0,Avoidance of biliary injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Biliary injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is still a serious problem. Injury occurs as a result of technical errors or misidentification of ducts. Inexperience, inflammation, and aberrant anatomy are key risk factors. The most serious technical problem is cautery-induced injury. This problem may be avoided by use of cautery under very low power settings in the triangle of Calot. Misidentification injuries occur when the surgeon mistakes the common bile duct or an aberrant right hepatic duct for the cystic duct. This error usually occurs when the surgeon uses the ""infundibular"" technique to identify the cystic duct. This technique, which depends on seeing the cystic duct flare as it becomes the infundibulum, is especially prone to be misleading in the face of acute inflammation. This technique is unreliable and should not be used alone for anatomic identification of the ducts. It is preferable to use the critical view technique or to perform a cholangiogram."
CD009323,0,12541034,0,Surgical anatomy of hepatoduodenal ligament and hepatic hilus.,"The anatomical situation and variations of structures in the hepatoduodenal ligament and hepatic hilus are a legacy of their embryological development. The vascular, biliary, and lymphatic structures contribute to the functioning of blood and bile flow as well as lymph drainage of the liver. Connective tissue, fatty tissue, and the peritoneal sheet are enveloping underlying structures. Their position, shape, and relation to neighboring structures influence the situation during operative procedures. The cystic artery origin is variable, as is the number; and its recognition is important for safe cholecystectomy. Venous drainage of the gallbladder goes into the portal system of adjacent segments 4 and 5 and influences the spread of gallbladder pathology. There are some surgically important variations in the course and distribution of bile ducts and arteries in the hepatoduodenal ligament. The biliary anatomical variations significantly influence the incidence of bile ducts injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The arterial supply of extrahepatic bile ducts is delicate and variable and should be considered when trying to prevent ischemic injuries to the bile ducts. Inflammation and the combination of inflammation and anatomical variation are thought to contribute to a dangerous situation in regard to eventual injury to the bile ducts and vascular structures during operative procedures. This paper explores these questions."

Oral therapy with tetracyclines (250 mg q. i. d.) and substitution of folic acid and iron led to rapid improvement of the clinical symptoms which persisted after cessation of the antibiotic therapy. In view of the clinical course tropical sprue has to be assumed despite the short duration of the journey to a tropical region."

CD009323,0,12500833,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and incidental carcinoma of the extrahepatic bilary tree.,"Gallbladder carcinoma is found in 0.2% to 5% of patients undergoing cholecystectomy, and gallstones are found in 70% to 98% of patients with gallbladder carcinoma. Early diagnosis of carcinoma is difficult because of the absence of specific symptoms and the frequent association with chronic cholecystitis and gallstones. At present, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard for the surgical treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis and other benign gallbladder diseases. The aims of this study were to evaluate retrospectively the incidence of occasional and occult gallbladder carcinomas to ascertain the effect of laparoscopy on diagnosis and treatment of unexpected extrahepatic biliary tree carcinomas and to assess possible guidelines that can be taken into consideration when the problem is encountered."
CD009323,0,12500832,0,Palliative laparoscopic hepatico- and gastrojejunostomy for advanced pancreatic cancer.,"Only 10% to 20% of pancreatic tumors are resectable at the time of diagnosis. Patients with advanced disease have a median survival of 4.9 months. Palliation is often required for biliary or duodenal obstruction, or both, and for pain. Optimal palliation should guarantee the shortest possible hospital stay and as long a survival as possible with a good quality of life. In recent years, treatment options for palliation of biliary and duodenal obstruction due to pancreatic cancer have broadened. Endoscopic and percutaneous biliary stenting have been shown to be successful tools for safe palliation of high-risk patients. Nevertheless, fit patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer benefit from surgery, which allows long-lasting biliary and gastric drainage. While laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy and gastroenterostomy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer have been widely reported, laparoscopic hepatico-jejunostomy has been rarely described. In this article, we describe our technique of laparoscopic hepatico-jejunostomy and gastrojejunostomy. We also discuss current evidence on the indications for these procedures in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer."

The diseases operated upon were nearly exclusively benign. From November 1998 to July 2001, we performed 5 laparoscopic distal pancreatic resections at our hospital. The indications were: 2 adenocarcinomas; 1 neuroendocrine carcinoma; 1 high malignant T-cell lymphoma, and 1 cystadenoma. Additional procedures in 3 patients were: gastrectomy and resection of the left liver in the case with T-cell lymphoma; resection of a distant metastasis in the liver in the case with advanced pancreatic carcinoma, and a partial adrenalectomy in the case with cystadenoma. We did not note any intra- or postoperative complications in our patients. First of all, benefit is to be found in the early postoperative course. All oncosurgical criteria could be fulfilled."
CD009323,0,12499741,0,Staging laparoscopy and its indications in pancreatic cancer patients.,Laparoscopy has become a popular and widespread surgical technique. An important goal in the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer is to avoid any unnecessary procedure. Laparoscopy has been suggested as a routine tool for staging in order to prevent unnecessary laparotomies in these patients.
CD009323,0,12499739,0,Technique and value of staging laparoscopy.,"Despite significant improvements in preoperative tumor staging due to sophisticated new imaging and interventional techniques, peritoneal tumor spread and occult liver and lymph node metastases are only detected during surgery in some patients. Newer treatment modalities using neoadjuvant regimens are only given if occult tumor spread is excluded. Diagnostic laparoscopy has therefore been introduced to prevent patients with advanced tumor disease from unnecessary laparotomy and as a diagnostic tool in neoadjuvant treatment protocols. Laparoscopic ultrasound represents an important technical improvement in diagnostic laparoscopy. The main indication for diagnostic laparoscopy is therefore exact tumor staging, especially in terms of peritoneal, liver, and lymphatic tumor spread, whereas determination of local tumor resectability is not the main issue. The aim of the current review is to summarize the technique of staging laparoscopy and to discuss its clinical value for a variety of gastrointestinal malignancies."
CD009323,0,12496551,0,Gastroscopic-assisted laparoscopic cystogastrostomy in the management of pseudocysts of the pancreas.,"Once pancreatic pseudocysts become persistent, unresolving, and symptomatic, surgical drainage is mandatory. Between January 1998 and December 2001, we performed five laparoscopic cystogastrostomies for such pseudocysts with the simultaneous use of the gastroendoscope. The mean cyst diameter was 20 cm (range, 18.5-24). In the first four cases, the anterior wall of the stomach was entered through two 10-mm balloon cannulae under gastroscopic guidance. By introducing the laparoscope through one port and a harmonic scalpel through the other, a wide cystogastrostomy was performed. In the fifth case, a modification of the above technique was carried out. A single 10-mm cannula was used to enter the stomach and, with the use of a side-viewing gastroduodenoscope as the camera source, the harmonic scalpel was used to create the cystogastrostomy. The punctures in the wall of the stomach were repaired with endosutures. The gallbladder was removed in all cases. The mean operating time was 110 minutes (range, 92-128) for the combined procedure. There were no postoperative complications, and the mean hospital stay was 4 days. Postoperative follow-up with ultrasonography over a period of 1 year in each case revealed complete resolution of the cyst. Laparoscopic cystogastrostomy using harmonic scalpel under gastroscopic control is an effective and rapid method of surgically managing such lesions."

CD009323,0,12487288,0,Minimally invasive endocrine surgery: laparoscopic resection of insulinomas.,"Pancreatic insulinomas are mostly benign and solitary tumors. Successful management of patients with insulinoma relies on accurate localization of the tumors and the use of appropriate surgical techniques. However, preoperative radiological imaging studies often fail to localize the insulinomas because of the small tumor sizes. Conventional intraoperative ultrasonography combined with palpation has been widely used as the best localization tool. Since contact ultrasonography, a new technique for localizing pancreatic lesions, became available as a laparoscopic study, several surgeons have utilized laparoscopy for not only localization but also resection of insulinomas. Previous reports of laparoscopic ultrasonography for intraoperative identification of insulinomas showed a 100% success rate in cases with insulinoma localized by preoperative imaging studies, but a less satisfactory rate in cases with occult insulinoma. Laparoscopic resection of insulinomas located in the head of the pancreas is often difficult because of its anatomical relationship with important adjacent structures such as pancreatic duct and mesenteric vessels. In contrast, insulinomas located in the body or tail of the pancreas are laparoscopically resectable even when they are in close proximity to the major pancreatic duct. Laparoscopic procedure is a feasible technique with low morbidity for surgical management of insulinomas. Accurate preoperative localization is essential for safe performance of this minimally invasive procedure."

In July 2001, we safely performed partial hepatic resection under hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS). Three months after the treatment, computed tomography of the liver revealed HCC close to the first branch of right portal vein and bile duct. Although we performed transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for the tumor, this treatment was not effective. So we treated percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEIT) for the tumor area neighboring Glisson's capsule and radiofrequency ablation therapy (RFA) for the tumor. After this treatment the tumor showed no viability on dynamic CT, and there was no liver infarction or damage to the bile duct. Four months after the final treatment, enhanced CT revealed no viable lesion, and serum alpha-fetoprotein level was declining toward the normal range. We conclude that selection of an applicable treatment and approach is of importance for safe and effective therapy."
CD009323,0,12483275,0,Unexpected bile duct carcinoma presenting with port-site metastasis after laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystolithiasis.,"On March 1, 1999, a 71-year-old woman was diagnosed as having cholecystolithiasis, for which she underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy at a local hospital. Intraoperative cholangiography was not performed. No malignant lesion was detected in the gallbladder. In March 2000, a subcutaneous tumor was pointed out at the port site in her abdomen, and resected. Histological examination revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma. On detailed examination, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed a tumor, about 2 cm in diameter, in the lower bile duct. On June 1, she underwent pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy at our institute, and several disseminated lesions were detected at the port site and in the abdominal cavity. There have been few reports of bile duct carcinoma that developed peritoneal dissemination caused by leakage of bile during cholecystectomy. Leakage of bile should be prevented during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, even in patients not diagnosed as having cancer preoperatively."
CD009323,0,12477980,0,Care of the laparoscopic colectomy patient.,"Laparoscopic bowel surgery has demonstrated patient care benefits of decreased duration of hospital stay, smaller incisions, lower risk of cardiopulmonary complications, and reduced risk of small-bowel obstruction. Resection of complicated diverticular disease and inflammatory bowel disease can be technically challenging and may be associated with higher conversion rates. The applicability of these techniques to colon cancer is supported by a growing body of evidence that demonstrates similar survival and recurrence rates obtained by open resection and the exaggeration of the risk of port site recurrences. Laparoscopic colorectal surgery has also challenged much of the standard postoperative care plans used for colectomy. Optimal postoperative care of the laparoscopic colectomy patient requires an appreciation of the faster recovery enjoyed by these patients and the fact that ambulation and dietary advancement need to be accelerated. Coordination between the surgical team and the postoperative care team is essential to obtain all the benefits associated with this new approach to the management of colorectal disease."

Despite of the abnormal position of the gallbladder, the biliary pain experienced by the patient was on the right side. Preoperative diagnosis of this anomaly was not made in this patient despite preoperative sonography. The cystic duct may open in the common hepatic duct either side. In this anomaly safe microlaparotomy cholecystectomy or laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed."

CD009323,0,12415844,0,[The current state of laparoscopic surgery for abdominal parenchymatous organs].,"Laparoscopic surgery for abdominal parenchymatous organs such as the liver and pancreas presents unique technical challenges and anatomic difficulties although laparoscopic splenectomy has become the standard procedure in some hospitals. The advances in laparoscopic technology have encouraged expert hands to extend the procedure to parenchymatous organs. Clinical cases of laparoscopic hepatectomy, as well as laparoscopic thermal ablation, for patients with hepatic tumor have been increasing recently. The most important considerations for laparoscopic hepatectomy are the clinical characteristics of the tumor. Tumors that are smaller than 5 cm and located in the lower or left lateral segment are good candidates. At present, partial hepatectomy and left lateral segmentectomy are appropriate operative procedures. The laparoscopic approach is considered the treatment of choice, as it is less invasive in selected patients. Laparoscopic pancreatectomy is difficult to evaluate at present because of the scarcity of clinical cases. Laparoscopic pancreatectomy is indicated for distal, enucleated tumors. Another procedure, pancreatic cystogastrostomy, utilizes an intragastric approach. Laproscopic splenectomy will be the standard procedure in patients suffering hematologic disease, although it remains controversial in cases of splenomegaly due to the possibility of portal hypertension or hematologic malignancy. The incidence of conversion to open laparotomy due to uncontrollable bleeding is closely related to the technical skill of the surgeon. Safer laparoscopic procedures for abdominal parenchymatous organs depends on further refinement of endoscopic technology and improved training in endoscopic techniques."
CD009323,0,12415842,0,[Laparoscopic biliary surgery].,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the standard treatment for patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease. However, there is a substantial proportion of patients in whom laparoscopic cholecystectomy cannot be successfully performed, and conversion to open surgery is required because of technical difficulties or complications. The incidence of bile duct injury has increased in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Meticulous dissection and intraoperative cholangiography could significantly reduce the rate of that injury. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is still controversial because of surgical difficulty. In our experience, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a beneficial option for patients with acute cholecystitis, and it may even be safe in the acute stage. A better alternative for high-risk early operation and septic cases is percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage. The coexistence of gallbladder cancer should be ruled out and preoperative diagnosis should be done carefully. Laparoscopic management of common bile duct (CBD) stones has many advantages. However it has been reported to be demanding and time-consuming to perform, which limits its widespread adoption. In our experience with 258 patients, laparoscopic CBD exploration was feasible for almost all CBD stones. The technical difficulties associated with laparoscopic CBD exploration could be overcome with the development of suitable equipment and increased expertise."

However, recent advances in radiology and laparoscopy have improved staging, and active biliary stent management may improve outcome in these patients. In the past the goal with surgery was to excise all gross tumor. Now, the surgical goal is to achieve negative microscopic margins even if a major hepatic resection is required. Similarly, chemotherapy or radiation was frequently given in isolation, but chemoradiation has become the standard. Therefore, the aim of this analysis was to determine whether survival has improved with better staging, active stent management, more aggressive surgery, and chemoradiation."

An en bloc splenectomy was required due to the close anatomic relation of the insulinoma with the splenic vein, as shown on intraoperative ultrasonography. The operative time was 4 h, and blood loss was minimal (<200 ml). Laparoscopic coagulating shears were used for the pancreatic mobilization, and an endoGIA was used for the section of the splenic vessels and the central pancreatic transection. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged in good condition on the 7th postoperative day.

Laparoscopic exploration revealed a viable ileal loop incarcerated through the mesoligamentum teres. The intestinal loop was reduced and the broad ligament defect was closed with a laparoscopic absorbable clip. Among internal hernias, hernias through a defect in the broad ligament represent only 4-7%. Defects within the broad ligament can be either congenital (ruptured cystic structures reminiscent of the mesonephric or mullerian ducts) or secondary to operative trauma, pregnancy and birth trauma, or prior pelvic inflammatory disease. CT scan may be diagnostic by showing incarceration of a dilated intestinal loop in the Douglas pouch with air fluid levels.

CD009323,0,12399067,0,Does neoadjuvant chemoradiation downstage locally advanced pancreatic cancer?,"Recent studies suggest that neoadjuvant chemoradiation can downstage locally advanced pancreatic tumors. There is limited evaluable data to support this approach. We review our experience with preoperative chemoradiation for surgically staged, locally advanced pancreatic cancer to determine whether patients are downstaged with multimodal therapy allowing for curative resection. A prospectively collected database from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center was reviewed. Patients admitted between January 1993 and March 1999 with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma were identified (N = 163). Chemoradiation was administered to 87 (53.3%) of 163, and regimens varied from standard 5-fluorouracil/gemcitabine-based therapies to experimental protocols. Only three patients (3/87; 3.4%) had a sufficient clinical response on restaging to warrant reexploration. Of these, two thirds were unresectable on subsequent laparoscopy because of extensive vascular involvement or metastatic disease. Only one patient underwent a potentially curative resection, with a survival of 18 months despite negative margins and no nodal involvement. The overall median survival for all patients with locally advanced disease treated with chemoradiation was 11 months (6.5 months without multimodal therapy; P = 0.004). Although chemoradiation is associated with improved overall survival in locally advanced disease, it rarely leads to surgical ""downstaging"" allowing for potentially curative pancreatic resections. Novel multimodality approaches are required."

Where there are no contraindications, the mini-invasive approach has undoubtedly become the gold standard for the treatment of benign pathologies, such as biliary lithiasis or gastroesophageal reflux. However, video-assisted surgery is not yet sufficiently radical, and in some cases lacks the feasibility to legitimate its unqualified use in oncological practice as a valid alternative to open surgery. In the case of malignant tumours its role is hampered by major drawbacks which restrict its use to carefully selected patients. The persistent lack of randomised clinical trials in many cases still exposes the comparison between traditional laparotomy and mini-invasive procedures open to the risk of subjective opinion, unless backed up by immediate clinical evidence. It is certainly a very exciting field of surgery and this review aims to offer an extremely concise panorama of the application of these methods to oncological pathologies affecting individual organs."

Other investigators previously have suggested that laparoscopy before laparotomy aids in the diagnosis of unresectable pancreatic cancer in a fair number of patients even after negative computed tomography scans [3, 17]. Many surgeons are reluctant to incorporate laparoscopy into the workup of patients with cancer of the pancreas because of the frequent need for surgical bypass in the management of either biliary tract obstruction or gastric outlet obstruction [9, 13]. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy combined with gastrojejunostomy in a porcine model, as well as the individual accomplishment of laparoscopic choledochojejunostomy.

Moreover, pneumothorax, cardiac arrhythmia, impaired venous return, venous thrombosis as well as peripheral nerve injury have been associated with the increased intraabdominal pressure as well as patient's positioning during surgery. Furthermore, undetected small bowel injury caused by the grasping or cauterizing instruments may occur with laparoscopic surgery. In contrast to procedures performed for nonmalignant conditions, the benefits of laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer must be weighed against the potential for poorer long-term outcomes of cancer patients that still has not been completely ruled out. In laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery, several important cancer control issues still are being evaluated, i.e. the extent of lymph node dissection, tumor implantation at port sites, adequacy of intraperitoneal staging as well as the distance between tumor site and resection margins. For the time being it can be assumed that there is no significant difference in lymph node harvest between laparoscopic and open colorectal cancer surgery if oncological principles of resection are followed. As far as the issue of port site recurrence is concerned, it appears to be less prevalent than first thought (range 0-2.5%), and the incidence apparently corresponds with wound recurrence rates observed after open procedures. Short-term (3-5 years) survival rates have been published by a number of investigators, and survival rates after laparoscopic surgery appears to compare well with data collected after conventional surgery for colorectal cancer. However, long-term results of prospective randomized trials are not available. The data published so far indicate that the oncological results of laparoscopic surgery compare well with the results of the conventional open approach. Nonetheless, the limited information available from prospective studies leads us to propose that minimally invasive surgery for colorectal cancer surgery should only be performed within prospective trials."

CD009323,0,12209244,0,Gastrointestinal recovery and outcome after laparoscopy-assisted versus conventional open distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer.,"Laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy has been increasingly reported as the treatment of choice for early gastric cancer. However, there is little information regarding the benefits of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG). LADG and conventional open distal gastrectomy (DG) for early gastric cancer were compared in terms of operative outcome, recovery of bowel function, complications, and changes in body weight. Thirty-four patients underwent LADG for early gastric cancer. These patients were compared with 31 patients who underwent DG during the same period. For estimating gastrointestinal motility recovery, 20 radiopaque markers were inserted into the duodenum during surgery, and abdominal X-rays were taken daily until all markers were seen in the ascending colon. Age, gender, and histologic differentiation of the lesions were matched. The LADG group required a significantly longer operative time and the dissection of fewer lymph nodes. Postoperative hospital stay and the occurrence of postoperative complications (ileus) were significantly shorter and less frequent in the LADG group. The LADG group showed a more rapid recovery of gastrointestinal motor function compared with the DG group during the early postoperative period. Body weight 24 months after LADG was about 100% of pre-illness weight, but no further weight change was encountered in the DG group. For selected patients with early gastric cancer, LADG with lymphadenectomy can provide a rapid recovery and good quality of life without compromising the cure rate."
CD009323,0,12205557,0,Videolaparoscopic resection of insulinomas: experience in two institutions.,"Laparoscopic resection of islet cell tumors has been performed in some selected cases. The aim of the study was to analyze the experience of two institutions in the laparoscopic management of insulinomas. In a 4-year period, videolaparoscopic resection of sporadic insulinomas was performed in 9 patients. All patients had hypoglycemia/hyperinsulinism and a solitary tumor demonstrated by image studies. Demographics, surgical findings, results, and complications were analyzed. Mean age of the patients was 43 years. One patient was male and eight were females. One tumor was located in the head of the pancreas, 4 in the body, and 4 in the tail. Laparoscopic resection was completed in all patients. Procedures included 4 enucleations and 5 distal pancreatectomies. Pancreatic resection with splenic preservation was achieved in 4 cases. Intraoperative ultrasound was used in 7 patients. Mean size of the tumors was 1.6 cm. All patients became normoglycemic after surgery. Complications included one pancreatic fistula, one pleural effusion, and one peripancreatic fluid collection. All resolved spontaneously. In a follow-up period between 3 and 48 months no evidence of recurrence has been observed. This series supports laparoscopic resection of preoperatively localized benign solitary insulinomas. The operation provides the advantages of minimally invasive surgery and can be safely performed in most cases."
CD009323,0,12200662,0,Migration of endoclip into duodenum. A rare complication after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"The long-term effect of spilled clips within the abdominal cavity after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is unknown. However, most surgeons agree that the migration of clips has limited clinical consequences. A few cases have been reported of clips that have migrated into the common bile duct, causing stone formation and/or obstructions. We present a case of gallstone pancreatitis treated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy that was complicated by bile leakage from the cystic duct stump 1 day after the procedure. Although the leaking stump sealed itself spontaneously after the placement of a biliary stent, a clip had migrated directly to the superior wall of the first portion of the duodenum. Herein the details of the patient's history are presented. We also discuss the possible mechanisms of clip migration and describe some preventive measures."

CD009323,0,12165832,0,A novel approach to gallbladder cancer in a Jehovah's Witness.,"Transfusion of blood or blood products peri- or postoperatively is often necessary in patients undergoing liver resections for hepatic or biliary tract neoplasms. In Jehovah's Witnesses this inevitably poses a difficult dilemma for clinicians. A 66-year-old female Jehovah's Witness with a T1b gallbladder cancer was referred to our specialist unit for further treatment after having had a routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy in another hospital. Although an abdominal computed tomography scan preoperatively showed a normal liver with no evidence of regional lymph node involvement, histologically the tumor was found in the posterior wall of the gallbladder adherent to the liver bed and had a full thickness involvement of the muscular layer, raising suspicion of a local invasion into the liver bed. The patient, having refused liver resection, was treated with a laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation under intraoperative ultrasound guidance using a newly developed ""cooled-tip"" needle and a 500-kHz radiofrequency generator. A ""zone of necrosis"" measuring 3.5 cm in diameter was created in the liver bed and adjacent tissues. The procedure lasted 90 min with no blood loss. Postoperatively, the patient was discharged on the third postoperative day and remained disease free at the 9-month follow-up. Although the follow-up in this case was too short to determine the long-term result of this approach, we believe that this is a single unique case posing a challenging problem to clinicians for which radiofrequency ablation may have a role in offering an alternative to major resections."
CD009323,0,12164560,0,Cancers of the gallbladder and biliary ducts.,"Neoplasms of the biliary tract tree are uncommon and have a poor overall prognosis. Although numerous risk factors have been identified, little is known about the pathogenesis of these tumors, and no effective screening technique is available for early detection. Surgery remains the principal treatment modality and the only potential cure, with laparoscopy playing an increasingly important role in determining the resectability of these tumors. The role of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation remains controversial. The efficacy of chemotherapy for advanced disease is relatively limited, with response rates of less than 10% for single-agent fluorouracil. Of the newer agents, gemcitabine (Gemzar) holds the most promise in the treatment of these difficult malignancies."

Hemorrhage occurred in 139 (9.5%) cases from which 75 (54%) lesions of the cystic artery, 63 (45.3%) cases of bleeding from the vesicular bed and 1 patient (0.72%) with section of the hepatic artery. Lesions of the bile ducts occurred in 13 (0.9%) patients from which 4 (3.07%) were on the right hepatic duct and 9 (6.93%) on the common bile duct.

CD009323,0,12140625,0,Duodenal polypectomy of Brunner's gland hyperplasia using a novel laparoscopic technique. A case report.,"Brunner's gland hyperplasia rarely is associated with clinical problems, and it accounts for only about 10% of benign tumors of duodenum. Therapeutic intervention is indicated when Brunner's gland hyperplasia evokes symptoms such as indigestion, bleeding, or obstruction. Endoscopic intervention (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) often can be used effectively, and in some cases may be preferable because of its minimal invasivencss. However, when the lesion is too large to pass through the endoscopic snare, endoscopic treatment is not possible. In these cases, a laparoscopic procedure may provide a novel approach to resection of the polyp, while still serving as a minimally invasive approach. We report the case of a 28-year-old woman with a large duodenal polyp treated by laparoscopic polypectomy."
CD009323,0,12140620,0,Failure of endoscopic removal of common bile duct stones due to endo-clip migration following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"We report herein an extremely rare complication; namely, endo-clip migration into the common bile duct, following laparoscopic cholecystectomy, that occurred in a 57-year-old man. He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but postoperative bile leakage occurred from the cystic duct stump and he was treated by conservative drainage for 1 month. Five years later, he complained of vomiting and pain in the right hypochondrium, and he was admitted for investigations of jaundice and liver dysfunction. Computerized tomography scanning of the abdomen and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed that several calculi, with six endo-clips as nuclei, had migrated into the biliary tract. Endoscopic removal of the calculi following endoscopic sphincterotomy, using a basket catheter, was unsuccessful, and it was therefore necessary to remove the basket catheter surgically. The mechanism of endo-clip migration and the method for removing the endo-clips are briefly discussed."

Pathologic examination revealed a renal pelvic villous adenoma and diffuse intestinal metaplasia of the urothelium; no enteral communication or gastrointestinal pathologic features were found. Urothelial villous adenoma is extremely rare, and one should consider neoplastic etiologies, including appendiceal mucinous cystadenocarcinoma and mucus-secreting adenocarcinoma of the renal pelvis, in directing the appropriate management of muconephrosis."

CD009323,0,12127118,0,Clinical and histologic follow-up after antireflux surgery for Barrett's esophagus.,"There are few prospective studies that document the histologic follow-up after antireflux surgery in patients with Barrett's esophagus, as defined by the recently standardized criteria. We report the clinical, endoscopic, and histologic results of patients with Barrett's esophagus followed postoperatively for at least 2 years. Diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus required preoperative endoscopic evidence of columnar-lined epithelium in the esophagus and a biopsy demonstrating specialized intestinal metaplasia, which stains positively with Alcian blue stain. Between April 1993 and November 1998, a total of 104 patients meeting these criteria underwent fundoplication (laparoscopic [n = 84] or open [n = 6] nissen, laparoscopic Toupet [n = 11], laparoscopic Collis-Nissen [n = 1], Collins-Toupet [n = 1] or open Dor [n = 1]). Short-segment Barrett's esophagus (length of intestinal metaplasia <3 cm) was found preoperatively in 34% and low-grade dysplasia in 4% of patients. All patients were contacted yearly by mail, phone, or clinic visit. At a mean follow-up of 4.6 years (range 2 to 7.5 years), 81% of patients had stopped taking antisecretory medications and 97% were satisfied with the results of their operations. Eight patients have undergone reoperation for recurrence of symptoms. Two patients have died and two were excluded from endoscopic biopsy because of portal hypertension. Sixty-six patients complied with the surveillance protocol, and their histologic results were returned to our center. Symptomatic follow-up of the 34 patients who refused surveillance esophagogastro and duodenoscopy revealed two patients who were taking medication for reflux symptoms. None of the patients have developed high-grade dysplasia or esophageal carcinoma during surveillance endoscopy (337 total patient-years of follow-up). The incidence of regression of intestinal metaplasia to cardiac-fundic-type metaplasia after successful antireflux surgery is greater than previously reported. We suspect that this is a result of longer follow-up and the inclusion of patients with short-segment Barrett's esophagus. A substantial number of patients with Barrett's esophagus who are asymptomatic after antireflux surgery refuse surveillance endoscopy."

CD009323,0,12098055,0,Three-dimensional reconstruction of biliary tract using spiral computed tomography for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"To increase the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, we have analyzed the biliary tract in a three-dimensional fashion. The union of the biliary ducts was studied in 50 patients using spiral computed tomography (CT) after intravenous infusion cholangiography. Depending on the union and course of the cystic duct to the common bile duct, cystic duct anatomy was classified into six categories: ipsilateral gallbladder side (type I) and contralateral side with anterior course (type II); contralateral side with posterior course (type III); intrahepatic side (type IV); intrapancreatic side (type V); and unclassified (type VI). The length of the cystic duct was also determined. The cystic duct was identified in 42 cases (84%); 30 cases (60%) were type I, 9 cases (18%) type III, and a single case (2%) of types II, IV and V, respectively. The length of the cystic duct was < or =2 cm in 30 cases that had a shorter operating time compared to 12 cases with a cystic duct <2 cm (p <0.01). In conclusion, three-dimensional reconstruction of the cystic duct anatomy using spiral CT provides simple classification of bile duct anatomy, and this preoperative information may increase the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,12098030,0,Detection of Mirizzi syndrome with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: laparoscopic or open approach?,"Imaging of the gallbladder and biliary tract has changed dramatically in the past 20 years. Magnetic resonancecholangiopancreatography provides a noninvasive alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography in the diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome. In this laparoscopic era, when diagnosis is certain, surgeons must choose between a laparoscopic and a traditional open approach. The authors review their cases of hepatobiliary surgery during the period 1993-2000. Three cases of Mirizzi syndrome (0.4%) were observed among 712 surgical hepatobiliary patients (two type 1 cases and one type 2 case). The authors suggest that with Mirizzi syndrome type 1, laparoscopy together with peroperative cholangiography should be used to resolve anatomic doubts. If clipping of the cystic duct is possible and certain, then laparoscopy may be continued and finished. In the case of cholecystocholedochal fistula (Mirizzi syndrome type 2), when the diagnosis is determined before surgery, the authors believe that laparoscopy is dangerous. Adhesions, inflammation, and anatomy changes may cause injuries to the main bile duct, so an open traditional approach is suggested."
CD009323,0,12086901,0,Staging of pancreatic cancer before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiation.,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy is used at many institutions for treatment of localized adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Accurate staging before neoadjuvant therapy identifies patients with distant metastatic disease, and restaging after neoadjuvant therapy selects patients for laparotomy and attempted resection. The aims of this study were to (1) determine the utility of staging laparoscopy in candidates for neoadjuvant therapy and (2) evaluate the accuracy of restaging CT following chemoradiation. Staging laparoscopy was performed in 98 patients with radiographically potentially resectable (no evidence of arterial abutment or venous occlusion) or locally advanced (arterial abutment or venous occlusion) adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Unsuspected distant metastasis was identified in 8 (18%) of 45 patients with potentially resectable tumors and 13 (24%) of 55 patients with locally advanced tumors by CT. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and restaging CT were completed in a total of 103 patients. Thirty-three patients with potentially resectable tumors by restaging CT underwent surgical exploration and resections were performed in 27 (82%). Eleven (22%) of 49 patients with locally advanced tumors by restaging CT were resected, with negative margins in 55%; the tumors in these 11 patients had been considered locally advanced because of arterial involvement on restaging CT. Staging laparoscopy is useful for the exclusion of patients with unsuspected metastatic disease from aggressive neoadjuvant chemoradiation protocols. Following neoadjuvant chemoradiation, restaging CT guides the selection of patients for laparotomy but may overestimate unresectability to a greater extent than does prechemoradiation CT."
CD009323,0,12085130,0,What's right when the gallbladder's left? A case report.,"During laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis in a 40-year-old woman, we came upon a case of incidentally discovered left-sided gallbladder (LSG). Two anatomic variants of LSG are known: (a) ""true LSG,"" in which, according to Gross, an accessory gallbladder originates from the left hepatic duct (LHD), the right embryonic bud is readsorbed, and the cystic duct joins either the CBD from the left or the LHD directly. Otherwise, a normal right-sided gallbladder adheres to the inferior left hepatic lobe, and the cystic duct joins the CBD from the right side (as in our case); (b) gallbladder under the fourth hepatic segment, medial to a right-sided round ligament, probably resulting from a prenatal obliteration of the right umbilical vein. Left-sided gallbladder is a paraphysiologic condition that when identified before surgery, must be studied by CT or MRI, when incidentally discovered during surgery must be promptly recognized by the surgeon, who must be aware of the unpredictable confluence of the cystic duct into the CBD. The following operative precautions are useful for avoiding a lesion of the CBD: The surgeon should start dissection of Calot's triangle as close as possible to the gallbladder margin, prepare and clip the cystic duct as close as possible to the infundibulum, and a 30 degrees angled telescope. If in doubt, the surgeon should perform an intraoperative cholangiography."

From December 1991 to December 2001, 116 patients with early gastric cancer underwent LADG in the surgical department of Oita Medical University and Koga hospital by the same surgical staffs. An operation record and clinical sheets were reviewed to obtain the operative findings, clinical course, and pathologic findings of resected specimens to evaluate the usefulness of LADG in the management of early gastric cancer. In all LADG procedures, regional lymph nodes dissection (D1+alpha) was successfully performed using laparoscopy. The mean operative duration and blood loss were 234 minutes and 139 mL, respectively. There were only four major complications, including pneumonia, leakage of anastomosis, pancreatic injury, and anastomotic stenosis, but all these cases were successfully treated conservatively. The mean length of postoperative stay was 16.3 +/- 2.5 days. All patients except one, who died not of cancer but of cerebral bleeding, were alive without recurrence or port-site metastasis during mean follow-up period of 45 months. We successfully performed 116 LADG procedures over 10 years. This procedure is recommended for the treatment of patients with early gastric cancer because of the associated good prognosis and several benefits, including less invasiveness and early recovery."

CD009323,0,12063954,0,Pre- and intraoperative evaluation of biliary system for successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy in porcelain gallbladder patients.,A porcelain gallbladder is generally thought to be a relative contraindication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of the difficulties in grasping the calcified wall of the gallbladder with forceps and making a retraction which would create a good operation field. The aim of this study was to define the clinical criteria for safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the treatment of porcelain gallbladders.
CD009323,0,12061685,0,Efficacy of cholangiography under helical computed tomography for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is known to be safe, the optimal imaging technique for examining the common bile duct and cystic duct prior to laparoscopic intervention remains controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of cholangiography under helical computed tomography (helical CT cholangiography) for LC."
CD009323,0,12057051,0,Advanced ovarian cancer.,"State-of-the-art treatment for advanced ovarian cancer requires a multimodality approach. Aggressive surgical debulking with the goal of optimal cytoreduction is the initial step. After primary cytoreductive surgery, standard treatment for patients with stage III and IV disease is systemic combination chemotherapy consisting of six cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Approximately 70% of patients enter a clinical remission with this approach, yet less than 30% remain disease free. Options following primary therapy include observation or second surgical assessment if no clinical evidence of disease is present. Novel strategies for consolidation are needed. Second-look surgery can be performed safely and effectively laparoscopically, and this is the most accurate means of identifying patients who appear to be clinically free of disease but actually harbor persistent cancer. Although this procedure is an extremely accurate means of identifying these patients, women who have pathologically negative second-look surgery are still at risk for relapse. Patients can receive additional treatment following second-look surgical assessment via the intraperitoneal route if they are pathologically negative or if they have microscopic or small volume disease. Alternatively, additional systemic chemotherapy can be given with non-cross-resistant systemic agents, but no current standard approach for consolidation therapy exists for patients following the completion of primary treatment. Unfortunately, most patients relapse. Multiple agents with similar activity in phase II trials are available to treat patients with advanced recurrent disease. Combination therapy in this setting has not been shown to have significantly superior progression-free or overall survival compared with single agents. The selection of treatment for patients with recurrent disease is currently based on a determination of the treatment-free interval since last treatment, as well as the route, schedule, and expected side effects of the agent."
CD009323,0,12049539,0,Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas in von Hippel-Lindau disease: a role for laparoscopic and cortical-sparing surgery.,"Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by benign and malignant tumors involving the central nervous system, kidneys, pancreas, adrenal glands, and paraganglia. Appropriate management of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas in VHL is evolving as we better understand the genetics and natural course of the disease and master advanced surgical techniques for adrenalectomy."
CD009323,0,12048629,1,Preoperative laparoscopic examination using surgical manipulation and ultrasonography for pancreatic lesions.,"Unnecessary laparotomies in patients with advanced pancreatic disease are unlikely to provide any benefits and may compromise both the quality and duration of survival. The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound to the diagnosis or staging, or both, of pancreatic lesions."
CD009323,0,12045853,0,Laparoscopic enucleation of an insulinoma: advantages of using the curved laparoscopic coagulating shears.,Laparoscopic excision is a widely accepted and well-described approach to islet cell tumors of the pancreas. We report the case of a patient with biochemically proven insulinoma who underwent successful enucleation using the curved laparoscopic coagulating shears. We discuss the advantages of using laparoscopy to manage these tumors and the increased benefit of using the curved instrument for this type of procedure.

CD009323,0,12042107,0,Laparoscopic retroperitoneal nephrectomy for Aspergillus-infected polycystic kidney.,"The management of polycystic kidney disease is mostly restricted to conservative measures. However, nephrectomy may be indicated in particular cases, especially when there are infective complications. To decrease the morbidity of the procedure, the laparoscopic approach has become appealing. We present a laparoscopic retroperitoneal approach to complicated polycystic kidney disease in a high-risk patient. CASERESPORT: We performed right retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy in a 39-year-old man who had autosomal polycystic kidney disease and had undergone heart transplantation. The immunosuppressed patient presented with severe flank pain, generalized signs of infection, and acute renal insufficiency. With the patient in the right lateral decubitus position, the retroperitoneal space was entered by the open technique, and the posterior pararenal space was developed with finger dissection. Five trocars were used. After the renal vessels had been secured and divided, the cysts were successively punctured, gradually shrinking the operative specimen. The kidney was placed in an Endo-catch and removed after morcellation, with no need to enlarge the 2-cm lumbotomy. The operating time was 80 minutes, and the hospital stay was 4 days. Histologic examination revealed a polycystic kidney with Aspergillus infection."
CD009323,0,12023724,0,Laparoscopic resection of an accessory spleen in a patient with chronic lower abdominal pain.,"During a diagnostic laparoscopy in a patient with chronic lower abdominal pain we found a pediculated accessory spleen (AS) near the left adnex. The pedicle was dissected by ultrascision, it was cut by an Endo GIA, and the AS was extracted. AS occurs in 25-40% of the population. They are always situated on the left side: hilum of the spleen, splenic artery, pancreas, splenocolic ligament, greater omentum, mesenterium, adnexal region, and scrotum. In most cases they are asymptomatic. In hematological disorders they can take over the function of the original spleen after splenectomy. Sometimes, AS can mimic tumors in other organs, such as pancreas, kidney, or liver. Likewise, there are descriptions of AS in the scrotum, the spermatic cord, the adnexes, the uterus, the stomach, the small intestine, or the heart. In rare cases they can cause pain because of cysts, abscesses, hemorrhage, or spontaneous rupture. In acute pedicle torsion an infarction can be caused presenting as acute abdomen, which is most often seen in young patients. In our case the pain was caused by pedicle torsions or mechanical irritation of the adnex. The cause of the changing localization of the pain was the long pedicle. In describing this case, we point out the advantage of diagnostic laparoscopy in patients with chronic lower abdominal pain."
CD009323,0,12022996,0,Diagnostic laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound for staging of patients with malignant proximal bile duct obstruction.,"Tumor staging in patients with a malignant obstruction of the proximal bile duct is focused on selecting patients who could benefit from a resection. Diagnostic laparoscopy, which has proved its value in several gastrointestinal malignancies, has been used routinely at our hospital since 1993 in patients with a malignant obstruction of the proximal bile duct, although data in the literature with regard to its additional value are conflicting. Therefore the diagnostic accuracy of diagnostic laparoscopy in patients with malignant proximal bile duct obstruction was evaluated. From January 1993 to May 2000, diagnostic laparoscopy was performed in 110 patients (61 males and 49 females), with a mean age of 60 years (range 30 to 80 years), who had a suspected malignant proximal bile duct tumor and in whom ""potential resectability"" was demonstrated by means of conventional radiologic staging methods (i.e., ultrasound combined with Doppler imaging, CT, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography). Laparoscopy revealed histologically proved incurable disease in 44 (41%) of the 110 patients (31 with metastases and 13 with extensive tumor ingrowth). Laparoscopic ultrasound imaging, however, revealed histologically proved incurable disease in one patient (1%), thereby preventing exploratory laparotomy in 46 because these patients had already been treated by palliative endoscopic stent placement. The remaining 65 patients were staged as having a resectable tumor and underwent surgical exploration. Thirty patients had an unresectable tumor (distant metastases in five; tumor ingrowth in surrounding tissues in 24) or benign disease (one patient). Sensitivity and negative predictive value of diagnostic laparoscopy for detecting unresectable disease were 60% and 52%, respectively. Diagnostic laparoscopy avoided unnecessary laparotomy in 41% of patients with a malignant proximal bile duct obstruction considered resectable according to conventional imaging studies. The additional value of laparoscopic ultrasound was limited. Therefore diagnostic laparoscopy should be performed routinely in the workup of patients with a potentially resectable proximal bile duct tumor."
CD009323,0,12016486,0,Outcome of laparoscopic pancreatic surgery: endocrine and nonendocrine tumors.,"Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery (LapPS) for management of benign pancreatic tumors has still not been defined. This paper evaluates the feasibility and outcome of LapPS in patients with endocrine pancreatic tumors (EPTs) and cystic neoplasms of the pancreas (CyNP). Eighteen patients with benign pancreatic tumors underwent LapPS between January 1998 and May 2001. The indications were 10 EPTs (6 sporadic insulinomas, 1 multiple insulinoma of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, 2 nonfunctioning tumors, 1 VIPoma) and 8 CyNPs (3 serous cystadenomas, 5 mucinous cystic neoplasms). The laparoscopic procedure was performed using four ports with patients in the half-lateral position. Laparoscopic ultrasonography (LapUS) was used in all cases. Laparoscopic enucleation (LapE) was planned in five patients and performed in four (one conversion for tumor not found during laparoscopy). Laparoscopic pancreatic resection (LapPR) with spleen salvage was planned in 13 patients and performed in 12 (one conversion for metastatic VIPoma), with splenic vessel preservation in 11 patients and short gastric vessel preservation in 1. The average operating time was 3.5 hours after enucleation, 4.0 hours after distal pancreatectomy, and 5.0 hours after subtotal pancreatectomy. Pancreatic fistula was observed in two patients after LapE and in three patients after LapPR. Splenectomy for splenic abscess was performed 1 week after surgery in a patient with short gastric vessel splenic preservation. The average hospital stay was 5 days. We concluded that LapPS is a safe method for removing EPTs and CyNPs, although the incidence of pancreatic fistulas remains high. In selected patients LapPS offers significant benefit to patients: reduced trauma to the abdominal wall, short hospital stay, and a quick postoperative recovery."
CD009323,0,12021904,0,Laparoscopic-assisted liver resection.,"The recent rapid development of innovative laparoscopic instruments and improvements in surgical skill have made laparoscopic-assisted liver resection possible.

The hand-assisted laparoscopic approach for resection of cancer is still in its formative stage, and this review places it in proper perspective within the context of minimally invasive surgery currently being performed for both benign and malignant disease. The review also outlines the potential advantages and disadvantages, techniques, and site-specific procedures of hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery for cancer."

CD009323,0,11992807,0,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CPT-11 and cisplatin downstages locally advanced gastric cancer.,"We examined the role of neoadjuvant therapy in downstaging locally advanced gastric cancer. Preoperative staging was performed with a combination of CT scans, endoscopic ultrasonography and/or laparoscopy, and laparoscopic ultrasonography. Patients with T > or =3 tumors and/or node-positive disease by preoperative clinical staging were eligible for entry. Neoadjuvant therapy consisted of two cycles of CPT-11 (75 mg/m(2)) with cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)) weekly four times every 6 weeks. This was followed by resection with D2 lymph node dissection and two cycles of intraperitoneal chemotherapy with floxuridine and cisplatin. Twenty-two patients were entered into the study (4 with T3N0 disease and 18 with T3N1 disease). Induction chemotherapy was well tolerated with major toxicities being neutropenia and diarrhea. A median of 78%/75% of the planned dosage of CPT-11/cisplatin was delivered. Two patients withdrew consent during the first cycle and were lost to follow-up. One patient progressed to stage IV disease during induction chemotherapy and did not undergo surgery. Nineteen patients underwent surgery. One patient had undetected stage IV disease (liver) and underwent a palliative R2 resection. Of the 18 remaining patients, 17 had curative R0 resections and one had a palliative R1 resection. A median of 21 lymph nodes (range 1 to 121) were examined histologically. There was one postoperative death. Surgical morbidity did not appear to increase after the neoadjuvant regimen. The median postoperative length of hospital stay was 9 days (range 3 to 75 days). Postoperative pathologic staging yielded 16% T3 lesions compared to 85% before treatment based on clinical staging; postoperative American Joint Committee on Cancer staging yielded 37% stage IIIA disease compared to 70% stage IIIA before treatment. With a median follow-up of 15 months, median survival has not yet been reached. We conclude that CPT-11-based neoadjuvant therapy downstages locally advanced gastric cancer. Further follow-up is necessary to determine the ultimate impact of this combination therapy on recurrence and survival."
CD009323,0,11992798,0,"The value of laparoscopy in the management of ampullary, duodenal, and distal bile duct tumors.","Laparoscopy identifies radiologically occult advanced disease in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The value of laparoscopy in the management of peri-ampullary tumors was determined. One hundred forty-four patients with radiologically resectable nonpancreatic adenocarcinoma, periampullary tumors were identified from a prospective database between August 1993 and December 2000. Criteria for laparoscopic unresectability included histologically proved peritoneal or hepatic metastases, distant nodal involvement, arterial involvement, and local extension outside the resection field. Median age at operation was 70 years (range 31 to 87 years) and 56% of the patients were men. An adequate laparoscopy was performed in 134 cases (93%). Laparoscopy identified 13 patients (10%) with unresectable disease. Of 121 patients with laparoscopic resectable disease, 111 (92%) went on to subsequent resection; CT correctly predicted resectability in 82%. Laparoscopy spared 36% of unresectable patients a nontherapeutic laparotomy. Patients with resectable disease were treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 91, 76%), ampullectomy (n = 12, 10%), duodenal resection (n = 10, 9%), or bile duct excision (n = 6, 5%). The addition of diagnostic laparoscopy to dynamic CT scanning in this selected patient population identifies an additional 10% of patients with unresectable disease. We believe that laparoscopy should be used in a selective manner for preoperative staging of patients suspected of having nonpancreatic periampullary tumors."
CD009323,0,11986021,0,Diagnostic laparoscopy for periampullary and pancreatic cancer: what is the true benefit?,"The role of diagnostic laparoscopy in patients with periampullary and pancreatic malignancies is controversial. A retrospective review was performed including all patients (n = 188) with a periampullary or pancreatic malignancy who underwent both CT and laparotomy at our institution between January 1997 and December 1999. The overall resectability rate for all periampullary cancers was 67.3% (115 of 171 patients). This compared favorably with the resectability rate for cancers of the pancreatic body and tail (3 of 17 patients, 17.6%; P < 0.01 vs. periampullary cancers). Fifty percent of patients with periampullary cancers were unresectable because of metastatic disease, whereas metastatic disease precluded resection in 64.3% of patients with cancers of the pancreatic body and tail. After patients undergoing operative palliation were eliminated, a nontherapeutic laparotomy would have been precluded by the use of diagnostic laparoscopy in only 2.3% of patients with periampullary cancers (4 of 171 patients). In contrast, 6 (35.3%) of 17 patients with cancers of the pancreatic body and tail underwent a nontherapeutic laparotomy (P < 0.01 vs. periampullary cancers). One hundred fifty-eight (84%) of the 188 CT reports reviewed could be definitively categorized as either ""likely to be resectable"" or ""likely to be unresectable."" The remaining 16% were equivocal. Of the 107 patients categorized as likely to be resectable, 89 were actually resected (83.2%). In contrast, only 10 of the 51 patients categorized as likely to be unresectable could be resected (19.6%)."
CD009323,0,11985998,0,"Ultrasound-guided radiofrequency thermal ablation of liver tumors: percutaneous, laparoscopic, and open surgical approaches.","Only 10% to 20% of patients with primary and colorectal metastatic liver tumors are candidates for curative surgical resection. Even after curative treatment, tumors recur commonly in the liver. As a less invasive therapy, radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA) of primary, metastatic, and recurrent liver tumors was performed under percutaneous, laparoscopic, or open intraoperative ultrasound guidance. The safety and local control efficacy of RFA were investigated. RFA was performed mostly in patients with unresectable hepatomas or metastatic liver tumors. Patients with large tumors, major vessel or bile duct invasion, limited extrahepatic metastases, or liver dysfunction were not excluded. An RFA system with a 15-gauge electrode-cannula with four-pronged retractable needles was used. All patients were followed for more than 8 months to assess morbidity and mortality, and to determine tumor recurrence. Sixty RFA operations were performed in 46 patients: 11 patients underwent repeat RFA once or twice. A total of 204 tumors were treated: 70 hepatomas and 134 metastatic tumors. Tumor size ranged from 5 mm to 180 mm (mean 36 mm). RFA was performed in 29 operations for 81 tumors percutaneously, in seven operations for 14 tumors laparoscopically, and in 24 operations for 109 tumors by open surgery. Combined colorectal resection was carried out in five operations and combined hepatic resection was carried out in three operations. There was one death (1.7%) from liver failure, and there were three major complications (5%): one case of bile leakage and two biliary strictures due to thermal injury. There were no intra-abdominal infectious or bleeding complications. The length of hospital stay ranged from 0 to 2, 1 to 3, and 4 to 7 days for percutaneous, laparoscopic, and open surgical RFA, respectively. During a mean follow-up period of 20.5 months, local tumor recurrence at the RFA site was diagnosed in 18 (8.8%) of 204 tumors. The risk factors for local recurrence included large tumor size and major vessel invasion: recurrence rates for tumors less than 4 cm, 4 to 10 cm, and greater than 10 cm, and for those with vessel invasion were 3.3%, 14.7%, 50%, and 47.8%, respectively. Ten of 18 tumors recurring locally were retreated by RFA, and eight of them showed no further recurrence. Ultrasound-guided RFA is a relatively safe, well-tolerated, and versatile treatment option that offers excellent local control of primary and metastatic liver tumors. The appropriate use of percutaneous, laparoscopic, and open surgical RFA is beneficial in the management of patients with liver tumors in a variety of situations."

CD009323,0,11984658,0,Primary pancreatic lymphoma.,"Primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL) is a rare form of extranodal lymphoma (less than 0.5% of pancreatic tumors) originating from the pancreatic parenchyma. Histopathological examination is usually mandatory to obtain a definitive diagnosis since symptoms and radiological features are quite similar to those of other pancreatic masses. Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the pancreas requires experienced cytopathologists as well as advanced immunohistochemical assays to obtain a final diagnosis on a small amount of tissue. A 46-year-old man complaining of watery diarrhea and severe weight loss (more than 20 kg) for more than 1 year was admitted to our hospital due to severe diabetic crisis. Enlarged lymph nodes (2.5 x 1 cm) were found at the right axillary stations. Abdominal ultrasound revealed the presence of a large hyperechogenic mass, mainly located at the pancreatic head. Abdominal computed tomography scan confirmed a diffuse enlargement of the head and body of the pancreas associated with lymphadenopathy along the lesser gastric curvature. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided FNA of the pancreas as well as gross biopsy of the axillary lymph nodes were unable to identify the nature of the mass. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed: several enlarged lymph nodes along the lesser gastric curvature were revealed. Multiple biopsies of the pancreatic head were taken and lymphadenectomy along the lesser curvature and the hepatic hilus was also performed. The definitive histopathological examination of the pancreatic specimen revealed a primary low-grade non-Hodgkin B cell pancreatic lymphoma. The postoperative course was unremarkable; the patient underwent systemic chemotherapy regime for low-grade B cell Hodgkin lymphoma and he was symptom free at 9-month follow-up."
CD009323,0,11984159,0,Neuromas of the extrahepatic bile ducts as a cause of obstructive jaundice.,"We present four cases of extrahepatic bile duct neuromas causing obstructive jaundice. Two patients with neuromas localized in the hepatic duct had no evidence of gallstones or history of previous surgery. In these subjects, partial resection of the common bile duct and cholecystectomy was followed by hepatico-jejunostomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction. In another patient, 7 years after cholecystectomy, a neuroma localized in the hepatic duct was treated by insertion of a T-tube. In the fourth patient, 9 years after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, partial common bile duct resection and Roux-en-Y hepatico-jejunostomy was performed. In all cases, the correct diagnosis of this very rare cause of extrahepatic bile duct obstruction was established postoperatively."

CD009323,0,11964081,0,Effects of taurolidine and octreotide on port site and liver metastasis after laparoscopy in an animal model of pancreatic cancer.,"Port site metastasis is a dreadful event following laparoscopy; however, the exact pathomechanism is still unknown. In order to prevent trocar metastasis we determined the effects of intraperitoneal lavage with either taurolidine or octreotide on port site and liver metastasis after laparoscopy in a chemically induced, solid pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma was induced in 60 Syrian hamsters by weekly injection of 10 mg/kg body weight N-nitrosobis-2-oxopropylamine s.c. for 10 weeks. Six weeks later, a laparoscopic pancreatic biopsy was performed by the use of a pneumoperitoneum with carbon dioxide (12 mm Hg), followed by an abdominal irrigation with 5 ml normal saline (group 1, n = 20), 5 ml 0.5% taurolidine (group 2, n = 20) or 5 ml octreotide (20 mg/ml) (group 3, n = 20). After 8 weeks, all hamsters were sacrificed and histopathologically examined. There was only one macroscopic visible primary tumor in the taurolidine group (5.9%), compared to 42.1% in the saline group and 62.5% in the octreotide group (P < 0.05). The size of carcinomas was smaller in the saline group than after octreotide irrigation (median 6, range 2-25 vs. median 70, range 40-160 mm2, P < 0.05). The number of liver metastases per animal was increased after saline irrigation (median 4, range 2-6), compared to taurolidine (median 2, range 1-3) or octreotide (median 2.5, range 2-4) (P < 0.05). Port site metastases were found in 36.8% after saline, in 37.5% after octreotide and in 0% after taurolidine irrigation (P < 0.05). Thus port site metastasis was effectively prevented by taurolidine irrigation after staging-laparoscopy in pancreatic cancer."
CD009323,0,11961650,0,Spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with conservation of the splenic artery and vein for a large insulinoma.,"We report a successful spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for a large insulinoma with conservation of the splenic artery and vein. The patient was a 48-year-old man with syncope due to hypoglycemia. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography revealed a large 6-cm mass located in the tail of the pancreas. We adopted the laparoscopic approach to remove the tumor. After careful dissection and an accurate hemostasis between the pancreas and splenic vessels, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was carried out using a linear stapler. There were no perioperative complications. The patient was discharged uneventfully. He had no hypoglycemic episodes or abdominal symptoms during 8 months of follow-up. When performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons in conjunction with intraoperative ultrasonography, spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with conservation of the splenic artery and vein is a technically feasible procedure for the treatment of benign lesions of the tail or body of the pancreas."
CD009323,0,11961649,0,Laparoscopic enucleation of an insulinoma of the pancreas tail.,A 29 year-old woman with a tumor of the pancreatic tail was referred to our institute. The tumor was confirmed to be a solitary benign insulinoma that protruded from the pancreas and was distant from the main pancreatic duct.

CD009323,0,11957104,0,Laparoscopic total gastrectomy with distal pancreatosplenectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy for advanced gastric cancer.,"The standard lymph node dissection for advanced gastric cancer is a D2 dissection. Although D2 laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy with distal pancreatosplenectomy has been reported, no studies have reported a completely intra-abdominal laparoscopic approach, because of the technical difficulty of the procedure. We successfully performed this novel procedure in two patients with advanced gastric cancer located in the upper portion of the stomach. In fact, this surgery is technically feasible, and has a potential curability comparable with that of open surgery."
CD009323,0,11956906,0,Trends in treatment for pancreatic cancer.,"Although surgical resection is considered to be the only approach that offers a possibility of cure to patients with pancreatic cancer, the prognosis of the disease has not been improved markedly by any surgical procedures in the past 20 years. Large-scale randomized prospective clinical trials are being conducted in the United States and Italy, comparing standard lymph node dissection with extended lymph node dissection. Although preoperative chemoradiation has various advantages in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, it does not contribute to its downstaging and eventual cure. The combination of leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and extracorporeal irradiation, however, has been proven to improve the patient's quality of life (QOL). Palliative surgery still requires further research in areas such as the examination of morbidity rates and the duration of bypass effects, now that laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery have both been well developed. Recent biological research has revealed the mechanisms of the carcinogenesis and the progression of pancreatic cancer, and, against this background, we assume that more effective trials will be conducted soon. Immunotherapy with dendritic cells, as well as gene therapy with mutant adenovirus, has already been employed clinically. Pancreatic cancer therapy is now facing new prospects."
CD009323,0,11956904,0,Present status of the diagnosis and treatment of gallbladder carcinoma.,"Because early carcinoma of the gallbladder causes no specific signs or symptoms, most patients with this disease are diagnosed with advanced-stage tumors. High-resolution ultrasonography and a low index of suspicion for polypoid masses or asymmetric gallbladder thickening represent the best method of early detection. Despite regular preoperative gallbladder imaging, many cancers are only detected intraoperatively or incidentally on pathologic examination. All known or suspected gallbladder cancers should be definitively treated with a laparotomy, not laparoscopic surgery. For early gallbladder cancers (Tis and T1 cancers), simple cholecystectomy is adequate therapy. More advanced-stage carcinomas without distant metastases should routinely be managed with a radical cholecystectomy, which includes partial hepatectomy and regional lymphadenectomy. Any adherent organs should be resected en bloc with the cancer. Pancreatoduodenectomy has been performed in several Japanese centers, but is rarely performed in the West for locally advanced gallbladder cancers. Most patients who undergo curative resection will develop recurrent disease, but there is currently no proven effective adjuvant therapy."
CD009323,0,11941940,0,Spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for cystic adenoma.,"For borderline malignant diseases of the pancreas such as cystic adenoma, partial pancreatectomy or pancreatoduodenectomy including pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy have been performed depending on tumor location under large median laparotomy. To investigate the feasibility of a technique with minimal skin incision, while retaining safety equivalent to conventional resection of the pancreatic tail, by making use of the advantages of laparoscopic procedure, we performed a minimally invasive laparoscopic resection of the pancreatic tail with preservation of the spleen. A 69-year-old woman underwent surgery for a diagnostic therapy for a cystic lesion of the pancreatic tail. The procedure was performed as follows: All procedures were performed completely laparoscopically under CO2 insufflation. After dissection of the omentum, laparoscopic ultrasound was performed to identify the location of the tumor and splenic vessels. The splenic hilus was dissected with preservation of the splenocolic ligament to maintain the lower blood supply to the spleen. The left gastroepiploic artery and the short gastric arteries and veins could be preserved. After division of the splenic hilus, the splenic artery and vein were identified from behind the pancreas by being held up and dissected individually by intracorporeal ligation by 3-0 Nylon. Then, pancreatic transection was performed 1 cm proximal to the tumor with the Endo-GIAII. The duration of operation was 4.5 hours. Intraoperative blood loss was under 50 mL. Histological examination revealed mucinous cytadenoma. She could walk the day after surgery and was discharged from the hospital uneventfully. CT prior to discharge from the hospital revealed sufficient blood flow in the spleen. Thus, it may be feasible to select laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy as a first choice for diagnostic therapy for cystic lesions of the pancreatic tail."

Immediately before this surgery, laparoscopy was performed and removal of the lymph nodes was attempted. There were two objectives: (1) to obtain information on the adverse effects and difficulties associated with laparoscopic lymph node removal and (2) to determine the adequacy of the lymph node removal."
CD009323,0,11912682,0,[Fortuitous discovery of gallbladder cancer].,"The prognosis of gallbladder cancer is basically dependent on the histological stage at diagnosis. In practice, the discovery of a small cancer of the bladder, generally during cholecystectomy give the patient a better care for curative treatment. The advent of laparoscopy has increased the number of cholecstectomies and could increase the frequency of this situation but also raises the difficult problem of metastatic dissemination. In the literature the figures on parietal metastasis after laparoscopy have ranged from 125% to 19%. The median delay to diagnosis of recurrence is 6 months. The cause of this phenomenon (role of the pneumoperitoneum) remains poorly elucidated. Risk factors for the development of a metastasis on the trocar orifice are: rupture of the gallbladder perioperatively and extraction of the gallbladder without protection. It is important to keep in mind this exceptional but serious risk and apply rigorous operative technique. In case of suspected gallbladder we do not advocate laparoscopy. Surgery (hepatectomy, lymphodenectomy, possibly resection of the biliary tract) would be indicted for all stages except pTis and T1a, taking into consideration the localization of the tumor and the patient's general status. It is also classical to recommend resection of the trocar orifices after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There is a dual challenge today for small-sized gallbladder cancer: improving treatment and avoiding poorer prognosis due to the specific problems raised by laparoscopy."
CD009323,0,11910481,0,Surgical strategy for cystic diseases of the liver in a western hepatobiliary center.,"The aim of this study was to define the indications and evaluate the results of various management options in patients with cystic liver disease. Between 1992 and 1999 we managed 60 consecutive patients with cystic liver disease. Diagnoses included a simple cyst (solitary 12, multiple 10), adult polycystic liver disease (APLD 17), Caroli's disease (8), hydatid cysts (4), and neoplastic cysts (9). Half of the patients with simple cysts had mild or no symptoms and required no treatment. Percutaneous drainage in eight patients (simple cyst 4, APLD 4) was followed by symptomatic recurrence in three. Laparoscopic deroofing in three patients (multiple simple cysts 2, APLD 1) was followed by symptomatic enlargement of the remaining cysts that required further intervention (laparoscopic deroofing 2, transplantation 1). Laparoscopic hepatectomy was successful in three patients with solitary simple cysts. Of 18 patients who underwent open hepatic resection (neoplastic 8, Caroli's 4, simple cysts 3, hydatid cysts 2, APLD 1), 2 patients with Caroli's disease required liver transplantation for disease progression. Nine patients (Caroli's 5, APLD 4) underwent liver transplantation, and three had a concomitant renal transplant. Seven patients developed complications, and three died (5%). Cholangiocarcinoma developed in three patients with bilateral Caroli's disease, and all died. Radiologic treatment has a limited role in the management of patients with simple cysts or APLD. Laparoscopic deroofing of simple cysts may have to be repeated, whereas resection minimizes cyst recurrence. Unilobar Caroli's disease may be resected, whereas bilateral disease requires early liver transplantation owing to the high risk of malignancy. Transplantation is a reserved option in patients with extensive APLD."
CD009323,0,11901928,0,Roux-en-Y long limb diversion as the first option for patients who have Barrett's esophagus.,"In summary, vagotomy plus antrectomy and the Roux-en-Y procedure is based on the following points: (a) patients who have BE show several foregut abnormalities, including incompetent lower esophageal sphincter, impairment in the esophageal clearance, severe gastroesophageal acid reflux, and frequent duodenoesophageal reflux; (b) late results of classic antireflux procedure in BE are poor with a high recurrence rate owing to a progressive loosening of the wrap; (c) the esophageal damage is produced by the injurious component of the refluxate; and (d) among patients who underwent classic antireflux surgery, a certain proportion developed dysplasia or even adenocarcinoma in the follow-up. The authors have observed that the simple correction of the valve is not enough in many cases, because it does not abolish the gastroesophageal reflux but only diminishes it. In patients who have BE and therefore have impaired esophageal clearance, few reflux episodes can maintain or even induce more damage. With the reduction diversion antireflux procedure, the quality of the corrected valve is secondary, and the main goal is to avoid the reflux of injurious components of the refluxate instead of the refluxate itself, which is almost always impossible. Late results support this hypothesis, and the authors propose this surgical procedure as an alternative treatment in patients who have complicated BE or in patients who have long-segment BE. Among patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and intestinal metaplasia of the cardia or with a noncomplicated short-segment BE, laparoscopic antireflux surgery is the authors' first choice, and only the late objective evaluation of surgical treatment demonstrates which surgical technique is the more adequate to a particular patient who has BE."
CD009323,0,11901924,0,Standard antireflux operations in patients who have Barrett's esophagus. Current results.,"Several therapeutic options exist for patients who have BE, and treatment should be individualized (Fig. 1). The best option in patients who have a high surgical risk or who reject surgery is lifelong conservative treatment, adjusting the PPI dosage with pH-metric controls. In patients who have a low surgical risk the best option is Nissen fundoplication. Only in cases in which esophageal shortening prevents a tension-free fundoplication from being done is a Collis gastroplasty associated with a fundoplication indicated. Other options may be indicated only in exceptional circumstances: (a) duodenal switch, when, after multiple failures with previous surgery, the approach to the esophagogastric junction is extremely difficult; and (b) esophageal resection, when there is a nondilatable esophageal stenosis and in cases in which the histologic study reveals the presence of high-grade dysplasia. Whatever treatment is used, an endoscopic surveillance program is mandatory, since, with the exception of total esophagectomy, no therapeutic option completely eliminates the risk for progression to adenocarcinoma."

CD009323,0,11873771,0,Isolated agenesis of the gallbladder: report of a case.,"We report the rare case of an isolated gallbladder with cystic duct agenesis that was misdiagnosed as acute alithiasic cholecystitis. We underline the inaccuracy of currently used diagnostic tests and the importance of making a correct preoperative diagnosis to avoid a needless surgical procedure. Based on the rare and incidental nature of this congenital anomaly, we discourage an extensive routine diagnostic workup, but rather, suggest a careful clinical and diagnostic evaluation of the patient who has symptoms suggestive of biliary tract disease. We conclude that in patients with gallbladder and cystic duct agenesis surgery might be useless and risky when performed by the laparoscopic approach. On the other hand, the awareness of the laparoscopic surgeon of the problems posed by this anomaly and a careful review of currently available diagnostic tests can prevent unnecessary laparotomy and minimize the risk of complications."

CD009323,0,11869005,0,Incidental carcinoma of the gallbladder.,"Incidental gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is a difficult management issue as there are no established guidelines. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with increased dissemination of the tumour cells (both in the peritoneal cavity and port sites). Depth of tumour invasion (T stage) and positive surgical margins are the most important prognostic factors, although tumour differentiation, lymphatic, perineural and vascular invasion may also affect the outcome. Simple cholecystectomy is adequate for mucosal (T1a) lesions only. For T1b tumours port site/wound excision with second radical operation (probably extended cholecystectomy -- wedge liver excision with regional lymphadenectomy) should be advised. T2 tumours should be treated with second radical operation (extended cholecystectomy or excision of medial liver segments 4b and 5 or 4, 5 and 8 with regional lymphadenectomy with or without excision of the extra-hepatic bile duct). Few T3 tumours can be cured and in some survival time may be prolonged by a second radical operation. More extensive liver resection (segments 4b and 5 or segments 4, 5 and 8) with regional lymphadenectomy with excision of the extra-hepatic bile duct should be advised. A second radical operation may palliate some T4 tumours. In the absence of extensive nodal disease, this operation may prolong the survival time. Excision of the extra-hepatic bile duct should be undertaken whenever the tumour involves the cystic duct margin or the extra-hepatic biliary tree. Epidemiology, risk factors, aetiopathogenesis and the modes of spread of GBC are discussed in relation to appropriateness of the second radical operation. Indications, types and role of the second radical operation are discussed."

Furthermore, little is known about the long-term physiologic and histologic changes that occur in the bypassed GI segments following these procedures. Many alternative radiological and endoscopic techniques have been described to access the distal gastric pouch and the duodenum after RYGBP.

Experimental group I underwent cholecystoduodenostomy and ligation of the distal end of the common bile duct, after which the animals were injected with N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine (BOP) alone. Group II, after the same surgical procedure as in group I, were given injections of BOP and then given loxiglumide in their diet. The sham-operated group underwent simple laparotomy and then were given injections of BOP. Loxiglumide significantly inhibited BOP carcinogenicity in the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile duct but not in the intrahepatic bile ducts or pancreas. Autoradiography showed that loxiglumide significantly suppressed (125)I-Bolton-Hanter (BH)-CCK-8 binding to CCK receptors in the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile duct but not in the liver or pancreas, and CCK binding to its receptors was observed in an area identified as cancer tissue. CCK receptor antagonists have an inhibitory effect on BOP carcinogenesis in the extrahepatic biliary tract, including the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile duct, of Syrian hamsters. The difference in the inhibitory effect of loxiglumide on biliary carcinogenesis in hamsters according to site may be due to differences in CCK receptors or the affinity of loxiglumide for such biliary tract organs. A difference between carcinogenesis in the intrahepatic bile ducts and extrahepatic biliary tract may be another reason."

From January 1996 to December 1998 a total of 85 consecutive patients who were candidates for ERCP because of a suspected diagnosis of mechanical cholestasis were included in this study. All patients underwent MRC and consecutive ERCP 24 to 48 hours later. The sensitivity for detecting common bile duct stones was 93%,specificity 74%, positive predictive value 89%, and negative predictive value 82%. For the determination of tumorous bile duct stenosis the sensitivity and specificity were both 100%. MRC might be an ideal method for evaluating patients with unclear laboratory or ultrasonography findings before laparoscopic cholecystectomy, thereby avoiding unnecessary invasive diagnostic tests with possible harmful complications."

CD009323,0,11847446,0,Treatment of extrahepatic bile duct disease in infancy and early childhood.,"Extrahepatic bile duct disease is a rare finding in infancy and early childhood. However, there is an increasing number of patients operated at this age reported in the literature. This increase may have multifactorial reasons, e.g. real increase, better ability of detection as a result of better diagnostic techniques and knowledge of predisposing factors of extrahepatic bile duct disease in childhood, especially in early childhood and infancy. The following report describes three cases of extrahepatic bile duct disease in infancy and early childhood treated at the Department of Surgery of the University of Technology in Aachen, Germany. From 1986 to 1998 28 Patients below 18 years were operated at our Department of Surgery. There was a recognizable increase of patients in 1996, 1997 and 1998. Whereas from 1986 to 1995 an average of 1.5 Cholecystectomies in pediatric patients were done, the years from 1996 to 1998 show an average of 5,33 patients operated per year. Every patient obtained a Cholecystectomy -- 15 conventional open Cholecystectomies and 13 Laparoscopies, which were primarily performed in children in our clinic in 1991. Besides cholecystectomy in one case a Hepaticoenterostomy was necessary and in another case surgical treatment of the Papilla of Vater and the Common Bile Duct was performed. In 22 patients symptomatic Cholelithiasis was the indication for a Cholecystectomy. Another Patient had a gallbladder polyp consisting of heterotopic Duodenal glands, two patients showed a shock gallbladder following trauma and cardiac operation and three patients had chronic Cholecystitis without gallstones. Clinical data was collected and retrospectively reviewed. Additionally, we created a personal questionnaire to carry through a follow-up. Three Patients were less than 3 1/2 years old. The youngest patient was only 5 months old and presented with Cholelithiasis and Choledocholithiasis. Another male patient, aged 2 years received a Cholecystectomy and a Hepaticoenterostomy because of a Choledochal Cyst Type Ib (Todani-Classification). And a 3-year-old-girl had a shock gallbladder caused by thromboembolism following cardiac operation nine days before."

Concerning the depth of wall penetration, 15 patients had mucosal cancers (m-cancers), and 12 patients muscularis propria cancers(mp-cancers). The gross patterns were lp (pedunculated) in 16 patients, ls (sessile) in 3 patients, IIa (flat elevated) in 4 patients, and IIb (flat) in 4 patients. The operative procedure used was cholecystectomy (C) in 12 patients, 4 of whom underwent lymph node dissection. Full-thickness cholecystectomy (FTC) was carried out in 3 patients, one of whom had lymph node dissection. Combination of C and gallbladder bed resection (GbBR) was performed in 7 patients, 6 of whom had lymph node dissection. Combination of C and bile duct resection (BDR), and lymph node dissection was performed in 1 patient. Combination of C and GbBR and BDR, and lymph node dissection was performed in 6 patients. All the patients who underwent lymph node dissection were negative for metastasis. Of the 27 patients, 2 underwent laparoscopic operation: one with m-cancer was 79 years old, and the other with mp-cancer 86 years old. In the m-cancers, no lymphatic, venous or perineural infiltration was observed. In contrast, in the mp-cancers, lymphatic and venous infiltration each were observed in 4 patients (33.3%), although no perineural infiltration was observed. A diagnosis of gallbladder cancer was made postoperatively in 6 patients, of whom 4 had the IIb pattern and all were complicated by gallstone, indicating the difficulty of diagnosing the IIb pattern. The 5-year survival rates for the m- and mp-cancers were as high as 90.9% and 80.8%, respectively. As a curative surgical technique for m- and mp-cancers, lymph node dissection should be performed in addition to FTC, GbBR, and BDR, in combination. When a postoperative histopathologic diagnosis of gallbladder cancer has been made, no second-look operation should be performed for m-cancers, but lymph node dissection of up to the second group should be performed for mp-cancers in a second-look operation."

The procedure was evaluated as successful in 36 patients (90%). It added an average 13.5 min to the operating time. A unsuspected common bile duct stone was identified by cholecystocholangiography in one patient and there were no cholangiogram-related complications. We concluded that laparoscopic cholecystocholangiography is a safe, simple, and quick procedure that can be used as an alternative to cystic duct cholangiography to identify the biliary anatomy and detect any common bile duct calculi prior to laparoscopic dissection."
CD009323,0,11757538,0,Why is it necessary to retrieve small bile duct stones at cholecystectomy?,"Recovery of gallstones from the stool demonstrates that gallstones pass into the duodenum due to antegrade sphincter of Oddi (SO) activity. However, retrograde SO peristalsis occurs in three-fourths of patients with bile duct stones as shown by SO manometry. The aim of this study was to investigate, by comparing patients with and without bile duct stones, whether reversed SO activity would retain even small stones. Thirty-nine patients with gallbladder stones < or = 3 mm in diameter underwent cholecystectomy, 22 of them with concomitant biliary stones. The remaining 17 patients served as controls. The diameters of the cystic duct and the small stones in the gallbladder and bile duct were measured. The case histories of the controls indicated previous passage of gallstones into the duodenum, i.e., a normal antegrade SO activity. Biliary stones < or = 3 mm in diameter were recovered in three-fourths of the patients with ductal stones, a sign of retrograde SO activity. SO dysfunction seems to occur in three-fourths of patients with bile duct stones and should be suspected when stones < or = 3 mm are present, as, under these circumstances, it is necessary to retrieve even such small stones."

CD009323,0,11727152,0,Laparoscopic-assisted resection of bleeding jejunal leiomyoma.,"Laparoscopic-assisted resection has shown remarkable improvements in the treatment of small bowel diseases, notably the leiomyomas. This case report documents the successful removal of a bleeding jejunal leiomyoma with the aid of laparoscopy. A 51-year-old man was admitted to the hospital twice within 3 months with melena. On the first admission, upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy were negative, and small bowel enema was inconclusive. On the second admission, Technetium-99 Red Blood Cells (Tm-99 RBC) scan showed dye extravasation (interpreted as from the left colon). Subsequent colonoscopy was normal, as was a barium enema. An elective superior mesenteric angiography revealed a benign-looking jejunal leiomyoma. Subsequent CT (intravenous contrast scan) revealed a 4.6 x 3.5 cm mass with neither extraluminal infiltration nor enlarged lymph nodes. The patient underwent successful laparoscopic-assisted resection of the leiomyoma and enjoyed an uneventful postoperative recovery. Subsequent histopathology confirmed the diagnosis. The diagnosis of small bowel leiomyoma is generally difficult because the conventional radiographic methods are unhelpful. These tumors are therefore best detected preoperatively with superior mesenteric angiography. Repeat of the noninvasive tests is strongly indicated if they are initially negative. Once discovered, small bowel leiomyoma should be resected to avoid catastrophic complications. Thereafter, it has an excellent prognosis. In this context, minimal-access surgery is a safe and approachable method to deal with such a problem."

A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the pathology of resected specimens following laparoscopic surgery and that following open surgery in cancer of the low rectum. Comparing the number of lymph nodes in specimens, we could then prove whether laparoscopic surgery can provide adequate clearance as well as open surgery and if laparoscopic surgery has no difference in comparison with open surgery."
CD009323,0,11692932,0,[Indications for preoperative laparoscopic ultrasonography].,"109 laparoscopic ultrasound examinations are performed for a period of 7 years (1993-1999). Laparoscope R. Wolf and 7.5 MHz linear probe ""Aloka"" are used. On the basis of the results analysis the following indications for laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) are recommended: 1. Uncertain diagnosis; 2. Contradictory results of imaging technics; 3. Assessment of tumour's stage; 4. Early diagnosis; 5. Negative data for liver lesion on laparoscopic examination and established or suspected tumour by imaging technics; 6. Negative data of laparoscopy and uncertain evidence of the imaging technics for liver lesion in cases with advanced locoregional stage of extrahepatic primary carcinoma and small chance for palliate surgical treatment; 7. Positive laparoscopic data insufficient to determine tumour resectability; 8. Suspicion for endocrine tumour of the pancreas. Laparoscopy and LUS are indicated for staging of hepatocellular carcinoma; gastric and colorectal carcinoma, especially in T3 and T4 stage; ""T4b"" stage of gastric carcinoma without liver metastases; all cases of carcinoma of the body of pancreas without data of liver metastases. LUS is irreplaceable nonsurgical diagnostic method in deep placed intrahepatic lesions. The main contribution to diagnosis of laparoscopy and LUS is not only to establish the liver lesion but to give differential diagnosis of the lesion and determine the tumour stage."
CD009323,0,11685926,0,Laparoscopy in pancreatic and hepatobiliary cancer.,"Laparoscopic techniques can be used for diagnosis, staging, and therapeutic procedures, both palliative or curative. Laparoscopy needs to be used in the context of algorithms of evaluation and management that consider the natural history and biology of the diseases at stake, concepts of evidence-based decisions, cost-effectiveness, quality of life, expertise available, and the philosophy of involved institutions. Accurate staging facilitates the selection of patients for resection, for neoadjuvant therapy, and selective planning for best palliation. The therapeutic role of advanced laparoscopic or laparoscopic assisted procedures is likely to increase (biliary bypass, gastro-jejunostomy, liver resections, cryosurgery, radiofrequency ablation, etc.). The place of laparoscopy in staging and treatment, however, has to be critically and continuously reviewed in the context of new developments in diagnostic imaging techniques, endoscopic procedures, and advances in oncology."
CD009323,0,11680932,0,Treatments of non-parasitic giant hepatic cysts.,"This retrospective study presents the results of surgical treatments for large cyst of the liver over 10 cm in diameter in 9 patients diagnosed and treated at Kurume University Hospital. There were 8 women and 1 man, with an average age of 71.6 years. Although the chief complaints were abdominal pain or fullness, 1 had obstructive jaundice due to biliary compression by a large cyst. Cyst size ranged from 10 cm to 27 cm. There are several treatment modalities for giant hepatic cyst, such as cyst resection, unroofing, and sclerotherapy after cyst drainage. Operative procedures in the patients reported here were surgical resection of the liver cyst in 3 patients, unroofing with ethanol sclerotherapy in 1 patient and laparoscopic treatment in 2 patients. Sclerotherapy after percutaneous transhepatic cyst drainage was performed in 3 patients because their general condition was poor. There were no postoperative complications among these patients. Costs varied among the patients and depended mainly on the method of treatment and period of hospital stay. We discuss operative procedures and costs of treatment of each patient and review the literature."

CD009323,0,11596897,0,Laparoscopic surgery and the common bile duct.,"Many biliary tract surgeons have now reached a level of sophistication with laparoscopic cholecystectomy that they are now able to deal with the common bile duct at the same time. Preoperative endoscopic cholangiography can be reserved for cases where choledocholithiasis has a high degree of probability. This has served to decrease the number of negative studies. The surgeon has five choices regarding stones confirmed by operative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: (1) do nothing, hoping the stones will pass spontaneously or that a postoperative sphincterotomy with stone extraction will be successful; (2) perform a transcystic laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (best for stones less than 1 cm and distal to the cystic duct); (3) perform a laparoscopic common bile duct exploration by choledochotomy (best for large stones in patients with common bile ducts greater than 1 cm. It is also the preferred approach with stones proximal to the insertion of the cystic duct.); (4) perform an intraoperative sphincterotomy with stone extraction, either retrograde or antegrade (this approach has some proponents but has not gained popularity among the majority of surgeons); and (5) place a double lumen catheter through the cystic duct with a proximal lumen in the common bile duct and the distal lumen in the duodenum. This can be used for serial postoperative cholangiography to confirm spontaneous stone passage or falsely positive operative cholangiograms. It is useful in situations when laparoscopic common bile duct exploration equipment or surgeon expertise is not available. If stones persist, a guidewire can be introduced through the distal lumen of the catheter for a guidewire-assisted sphincterotomy. Other CBD interventions that have been reported include laparoscopic biliary bypass and resection of choledochal cysts. Malignant lesions should not be approached by a laparoscopic method except in unusual circumstances."
CD009323,0,11596892,0,Endoscopic stenting for malignant biliary obstruction.,"Use of endoscopic stents to manage patients with malignant obstructive jaundice is a well accepted measure. Interpretation of the results of endoscopic stenting must be made with reference to the level of the bile duct obstruction. Results were generally unsatisfactory for hilar lesions, especially when the intrahepatic ducts were segregated into multiple isolated systems. After deployment, stent dysfunction due to clogging by biliary sludge is apparently an inevitable process for the conventional plastic stent. Considerable efforts had been made to prolong the stent patency by changing its physical configuration, coating the inner lumen, and the choice of material but with little success. The development of a self-expandable metal stent is a major advance, but the benefits derived from a larger stent lumen are compromised by the initial expense and the tumor ingrowth through the wires for all models available commercially. Current data failed to substantiate the value of routine preoperative biliary decompression, as there is no reduction in the morbidity and mortality rates after surgery. Although biased patient selection may have resulted in the negative observations made, repeated clinical trials should probably focus on patients with distal bile duct tumors who are preparing for a major pancreatic resection. As a definitive palliative measure, endoscopic stenting is a more cost-effective option than surgery for patients with limited life expectancy based on data regarding plastic stents. The recommendations are evolving however, as there is progressive refinement of laparoscopic surgery techniques and designs of endoscopic stents."

CD009323,0,11591987,0,Gallbladder injury in blunt abdominal trauma.,"A 36-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for an abdominal blunt trauma. At ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT), a gallbladder lesion was suspected, along with a tear of the liver. The patient was submitted to a diagnostic laparoscopy. The gallbladder was partially avulsed and bile was infiltrated in the hepatoduodenal ligament. Intraoperative cholangiography and Kocher's maneuver excluded other lesions. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, but due to severe hemorrhage from the liver tear, the operation was converted to an open procedure. Gallbladder lesions in blunt trauma are rare occurrences, but they are often associated with other organ injuries. US and CT scan are valuable for their diagnosis, but if a lesion is suspected, diagnostic laparoscopy is advisable in stable patients. It should be accompanied by a cystic duct cholangiography and a Kocher's maneuver to evaluate the integrity of the biliary tree. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally feasible. Associated lesions require laparotomy when they are not amenable to laparoscopic treatment."
CD009323,0,11591942,0,Use of the optical access trocar for safe and rapid entry in various laparoscopic procedures.,The use of the Veress needle in laparoscopy to create the pneumoperitoneum has inherent risks; it may cause vascular and visceral injuries.

CD009323,0,11588770,0,Laparoendoscopic approaches to enteral access.,"Access to the stomach for long-term enteral feeding or decompression can be achieved with numerous methods. The methods include laparotomy, gastroscopy, laparoscopy, and fluoroscopy. All methods have been shown to be safe and effective. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was introduced by Ponsky in 1990, and laparoscopic gastrostomy was introduced 10 years later. PEG rapidly replaced open gastrostomy as the method of choice for enteral nutrition. The laparoscopic alternative was ideal for patients who were not candidates for PEG placement. The laparoscopic or laparoendoscopic placement of enteral tubes allows visualization of the intestinal tract to ensure proper tube positioning. Many patients are not candidates for a PEG because of head and neck cancer, esophageal obstruction from stricture or carcinoma, large hiatal hernia, gastric volvulus, overlying intestine or liver, facial trauma with wired mandible, or severe stomatitis secondary to radiation therapy. Lastly, laparoscopy lessens the chance of injury to the surrounding structures, adhesions can be safely lysed, and metastatic or concomitant disease may be identified. This report will review the numerous methods available to the laparoscopic surgeon for gaining access to the stomach or intestine."
CD009323,0,11588768,0,Laparoscopic techniques in intestinal surgery.,"Laparoscopic bowel surgery has developed slowly over the last decade, with virtually all procedures having been attempted with these laparoscopic techniques. The benefits of this approach to colorectal surgery have resulted in decreased lengths of stay, smaller incisions, and a potentially lower risk of small bowel obstruction. Resection of benign inflammatory disease presents particular challenges and may be expected to result in higher conversion rates. However, with increasing experience, even complicated diverticular disease and Crohn's disease can be managed laparoscopically. There is a growing body of data that suggests the early concerns regarding colon cancer resection, specifically port site recurrences, may have been exaggerated. Even more importantly, the early results of a number of prospective randomized trials are suggesting that survival and cure rates are not jeopardized by laparoscopic colectomy. The surgical techniques are demanding and require a level of standardization to achieve success. Laparoscopic colorectal surgery will have a definite role in the future."
CD009323,0,11572023,0,Laparoscopic management of bile duct and bowel injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Accidental injuries to the bile duct and bowel are significant risks of laparoscopic surgery and sometimes require conversion to open surgery. Although some of the injuries related to laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be managed by endoscopic techniques, laparoscopic surgery is not yet sufficiently perfected. We investigated the efficacy of laparoscopic management combined with endoscopic tube or stent insertion in cases of bile duct and bowel injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted on 1,190 consecutive patients between April 1992 and June 1999. The first 70 patients underwent only preoperative intravenous infusion cholangiography (IVC), and the remaining 1,120 patients were subjected to both preoperative IVC and intraoperative cholangiography. We experienced 16 cases of bile duct injury (1.4%). Five patients with circumferential injuries of the bile duct were converted to open surgery for biliary reconstruction. The other 11 patients with partial laceration injuries of the bile duct and biliary leakage from the cystic duct underwent a laparoscopic simple closure technique. In 10 of these patients, an endoscopic tube or stent was inserted on the day after surgery to facilitate biliary decompression and drainage. Bowel injuries occurred in seven patients (0.6%). Three intestinal injuries were due to careless technique, and two duodenal injuries and two intestinal injuries were related to dense adhesions. All of these injuries were successfully repaired using laparoscopic techniques, autosuturing devices, or extracorporeal suturing via the umbilical incision. No postoperative complications were identified. We concluded that the biliary injury site could be closed with a laparoscopic technique so long as the biliary injury was not circumferential. Bowel injuries also could be repaired laparoscopically."

CD009323,0,11565773,0,"Effectiveness of the ultrasonic coagulating shears, LigaSure vessel sealer, and surgical clip application in biliary surgery: a comparative analysis.","Advancements in laparoscopic surgery are often dictated by the limitations of technical instrumentation. Energy sources other than electrosurgery have become popular with the promise of quick and effective vascular control. With their success surgeons have begun using these on structures other than blood vessels with little or no data establishing their efficacy or safety. This study evaluates alternative energy sources in sealing ductal structures for possible use in liver or gallbladder surgery. After elective cholecystectomy cystic ducts (n = 45) were resealed ex vivo with surgical clips (n = 14), ultrasonic coagulating shears (n = 16), or electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer (n = 15), and bursting pressures were measured. Nineteen additional human cystic ducts were randomized to seal by ultrasonic coagulating shears (n = 9) or electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer (n = 10) and fixed in 10 per cent buffered formalin for histologic evaluation of thermal spread (mm). After this nine adult pigs were randomized to laparoscopic ligation and transection of the common bile duct using surgical clips (n = 3), ultrasonic coagulating shears (n = 3), or electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer (n = 3). The animals underwent necropsy for assessment of seal integrity on the sixth postoperative day. In the ex vivo study the mean cystic duct bursting pressure was 621 mm Hg with surgical clips and 482 mm Hg with the electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer (P = 0.39). The mean cystic duct bursting pressure after ultrasonic coagulating shears was 278 mm Hg, which was statistically less than surgical clips (P = 0.007) and electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer (P = 0.02). The mean thermal spread was 3.5 mm for ultrasonic coagulating shears and 13.4 mm for electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer (P = 0.0002). All animals undergoing ligation and transection of the common bile duct with ultrasonic coagulating shears and electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer developed bile peritonitis by postoperative day 6 as a result of seal leak. All animals undergoing surgical clip ligation and transection of the common bile duct maintained seal integrity. The mean common bile duct pressure above the surgical clip was 12 mm Hg (range 10-14). In conclusion the acute ex vivo study demonstrated a significant difference in the cystic duct bursting pressure between surgical clips and ultrasonic coagulating shears and between electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer and ultrasonic coagulating shears. The ultrasonic coagulating shears and electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer failed to maintain seal integrity in the in vivo animal study. Given the failure of the ultrasonic coagulating shears and electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer in the animal model these energy sources should not be used for transection of the cystic duct or major hepatic ducts during hepatobiliary surgery."
CD009323,0,11561607,0,Advances in the surgical management of pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer continues to pose a major public health concern and clinical challenge. The incidence of the disease is nearly equivalent to the death rate associated with the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Thus, there exists a need for continued improvement in the diagnostic, therapeutic and palliative care of these patients. Surgeons play an integral role in the management of pancreatic cancer patients, with surgery providing the only potentially curative intervention for the disease. Specialized centers have reported improved hospital morbidity, mortality and survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy; however, disease-specific survival after surgical resection remains dismal. An emphasis therefore has been placed upon the accurate preoperative staging of patients in order to identify those patients who would benefit from a complete surgical resection. Surgical staging that incorporates the use of laparoscopic techniques now complements non-surgical methods of staging, including helical CT scans. While there is no defined preoperative staging approach, it is imperative that centers identify areas of expertise and experience with available modalities in any combination to effect accurate staging. Once patients have been accurately staged and deemed resectable, there exist various methods for resection of pancreas lesions, which include the standard ""Whipple procedure,"" pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, regional pancreatectomy, total pancreatectomy, and en bloc vascular resection, where appropriate. Reconstructive techniques have been explored and include methods of pancreaticojejunostomy and pancreaticogastrostomy with or without pancreatic ductal stents and intraoperatively placed closed suction drains. Perioperative mortality following pancreaticoduodenectomy for cancer has a general reported incidence of 1% to 4% at high volume centers experienced with the operation. Morbidity however still remains high with that of delayed gastric emptying, pancreatic anastomotic leak or fistula, intraabdominal abscess, and hemorrhage as the leading reported complications. Researchers have investigated several agents and strategies to decrease or prevent the potential morbidity of these complications including the use of octreotide, drainage of the pancreatic bed and institution of early enteral feeding. Unfortunately, the majority of patients with pancreatic cancer present with either locally advanced or metastatic disease that precludes operative cure. The expected survival for these patients is usually less than six months from diagnosis. Therefore, a goal of therapy should be adequate palliation of symptoms of pain, biliary or duodenal obstruction and improvement of remaining quality of life with the least degree of morbidity possible."
CD009323,0,11561606,0,Pancreatic cancer: current concepts in imaging for diagnosis and staging.,"Because of its late clinical presentation, pancreatic cancer remains the fourth most common cause of cancer death. Surgery is the only option for cure, and advancements in surgical technique and neoadjuvant therapy have the potential to increase the number of patients who could undergo surgery for potential cure. Accurate diagnosis and staging of pancreatic ductal carcinoma are therefore of great importance. This paper reviews the state of the art for such diagnostic modalities as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic ultrasound, positron emission tomography, and laparoscopic surgery and laparoscopic ultrasound for diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. Currently, accurate diagnosis and staging probably require the use of a combination of techniques, including multiphase helical or multidetector computed tomography and/or dynamically enhanced magnetic resonance imaging with endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration. The role of positron emission tomography still needs to be determined. The role of laparoscopic surgery and laparoscopic ultrasound may be limited in those institutions with state-of-the-art imaging techniques."

CD009323,0,11549077,0,Effect of the extracellular matrix on pancreatic endocrine cell function and its biocompatibility in dogs.,"The effect of the synthetic extracellular matrix (ECM) in a diffusion chamber for a bioartificial endocrine pancreas (Bio-AEP) on pancreatic endocrine cells in vitro and its biocompatibility in dogs were investigated. Two different types of ECM were used: type I collagen treated with low antigen (type I LA), and reconstituted basement membrane matrix (Matrigel) derived from Englbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse sarcoma. Matrigel contains growth and differentiation factors and cell adhesion molecules such as laminin, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and entactin. Purified porcine pancreatic endocrine (PE) cells were suspended in type I LA or Matrigel and then placed into a 12-well culture plate (4 x 10(7) cells/ml gel/well). The insulin accumulation from PE cells in Matrigel was significantly greater than that in type I LA (9.3 +/- 3.6 mU/well vs. 2.3 +/- 1.3 mU/well). When Bio-AEP with Matrigel and PE cells was implanted into the abdominal cavity of a pancreatectomized diabetic dog, the exogenous insulin requirement for maintaining normoglycemia was reduced for the first 4 weeks. However, after 6 weeks of implantation, fasting blood glucose levels suddenly increased. Laparotomy revealed encapsulated Bio-AEP with thick fibrous tissue. Following removal of the Bio-AEP from the abdominal cavity, another Bio-AEP containing type I LA and PE cells was implanted into the same dog. The exogenous insulin requirement was gradually decreased to almost half that of preimplantation levels. Bio-AEPs containing type I LA or Matrigel, but not PE cells, were implanted into the abdominal cavities of four healthy dogs. After 4 weeks of implantation, the Bio-AEP with Matrigel was encapsulated with fibrous tissue similar to that in the diabetic dog, but the Bio-AEP with type I LA was not. These results indicate that Matrigel may be incompatible with dogs and that the type I LA is more suitable for Bio-AEP."

A 27-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital after fainting from hypoglycemia. Diagnostic imaging showed a small tumor 1 cm in diameter in the body of the pancreas. Laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor was performed with laparoscopic coagulating shears. The operation time was 210 minutes, and there were no perioperative complications such as pancreatic leakage. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on the seventh postoperative day. The histopathologic diagnosis was insulin-producing islet cell tumor. This method is technically feasible and safe for the management of small islet cell tumors located on the surface of the pancreas."

CD009323,0,11511878,0,Ultrasound of the pancreas: update and controversies.,"The pancreas is an organ that often presents difficulties for ultrasound exploration due to the interference of abdominal gas in the stomach and duodenum. However, with technical experience and the use of a variety of examination techniques, such as filling the stomach with water or cellulose suspension, changing patient's position, or scanning at different moments of respiration, such as suspended inspiration or expiration, it can be seen in its totality in a high percentage of patients. In our opinion, especially as new technical advances have been incorporated into US equipment (color power Doppler, harmonics, and US pulse inversion) and new contrast agents are available, US can compete with CT in this field. Ultrasound can be as useful as CT in most patients with pancreatitis and pancreatic neoplasms. Furthermore, Endoscopic sonography (ES), as well as intraoperative and laparoscopic techniques, are also excellent for visualizing malignant pancreatic lesions and have a special role in preoperative staging. Finally, US is a good technique to guide fine-needle biopsy of the pancreas and for aspiration of inflammatory fluid collections and abscesses. Although CT has played a major role to date, US is presently the most widely available and economical means to visualize the pancreas."

Between January 1998 and December 2000, 13 patients with endocrine pancreatic tumours - 11 insulinomas and 2 non-functioning tumours-underwent laparoscopic surgery, laparoscopic ultrasonography being used in all the patients. Enucleation was performed in five patients. The operative time was 2-3 hours. Distal pancreatectomy was performed in six patients with insulinomas, and spleen preservation with intact splenic vessels was feasible in five. Splenectomy was necessary in one patient for technical reasons. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with splenic vessel preservation was performed in two patients with a large (6 and 8 cm) non-functioning tumour. The mean operative time for all the patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy was 4 hours, ranging from 3 to 5 hours. A pancreatic fistula occurred in three patients after tumour enucleation and in two patients after distal pancreatectomy; the mean hospital stay for all patients was 5 days. Enucleation guided by laparoscopic ultrasonography thus allows safe tumour dissection and excision, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy also being feasible and safe. Splenic salvage with splenic vessel preservation is technically possible. The laparoscopic approach allows a shorter hospital stay and an earlier return to normal activities."

Three months later, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) showed dilated common and intrahepatic bile ducts and luminal irregularities of the common bile duct. Seven months after the onset of his acute diarrhea, a repeat ERCP with aspiration demonstrated many Giardia trophozoites and cysts in the bile and continued structural abnormalities consistent with cholangiopathy. A 10-day course of high-dose intravenous metronidazole did not resolve these signs or symptoms. A gallbladder ultrasound showed a thickened wall. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy led to resolution of abdominal pain and normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase over an 8-month period. Gallbladder histopathology revealed chronic cholecystitis, but no parasites were seen on hematoxylin and eosin staining or with Giardia antigen enzyme immunoassay testing of the gallbladder. The patient refused to undergo a follow-up ERCP, but a right upper quadrant ultrasound and computed tomography of the abdomen were normal."
CD009323,0,11459275,0,The Mayo clinic approach to the surgical treatment of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.,"Ductal carcinoma of the pancreas remains a challenging problem for gastrointestinal surgeons. Significant progress has been made in diagnosis, preoperative staging, and safety of surgery; however, long-term survival after resection is unusual, and cure is rare. That said, the authors maintain their aggressive posture regarding this disease, recognizing that resection offers the only potential for cure. The authors' approach such patients in the most efficient and least invasive manner possible, relying primarily on triple phase helical abdominal CT for clinical diagnosis and staging, reserving ERCP and EUS for diagnostic dilemmas. In fit candidates with potentially resectable lesions, the authors eschew pre- or intraoperative biopsy, angiography, or endoscopic stenting and use preliminary limited staging laparoscopy selectively. Surgical palliation is chosen for fit patients who, at exploration for potentially curative resection, are found to have occult distant metastases or locally unresectable disease. Radical pancreatoduodenectomy can be performed with a mortality rate of 3% or less, and although morbidity remains significant, most can be managed with conservative measures. Quality of life after pancreatoduodenectomy is good and, if not, is generally a manifestation of recurrence rather than physiologic alterations inherent to the procedure. Adjuvant chemoradiation is standard therapy after resection, recommended for those with locally unresectable disease but used selectively for those with distant metastasis. Survival after potentially curative resection has remained disappointing. Whether extended lymphadenectomy or neoadjuvant chemoradiation improves survival has not been determined. Clearly, methods for earlier diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and more effective adjuvant therapies are sorely needed."

CD009323,0,11455483,0,Laparoscopic necrosectomy for acute necrotizing pancreatitis.,"Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), a disease state that is often complicated by an intricate pathologic process, has remained difficult to manage and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Approximately 80% of patients have a mild form of the disease, while the other 20% develop a severe life-threatening form of the disease. These patients are at great risk for infection, multisystem organ failure, and, possibly, death. Necrotizing or infected pancreatitis requires a multimodal approach and often offers an indication for surgical intervention. The retroperitoneum of the patient with necrotizing pancreatitis should be treated as an abscess cavity, and drainage and debridement of all necrotic tissue should be performed. Over the past several decades, great achievements have been made in the treatment of the patient that presents with acute pancreatitis. However, the morbidity and mortality have remained high, according to recent literature. The laparoscopic era brings new alternatives in the surgical management of pancreatic diseases. Advances in laparoscopic technology and instrumentation allow the utilization of minimally invasive techniques, and lessen the stress of surgery in the already compromised pancreatitic patient."
CD009323,0,11452824,0,[Surgical treatment in acute cholecystitis emergencies].,"The aim of the study was to demonstrate the importance of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis, without ""conservative"" treatment (intravenous fluids and antibiotics for 48-72 hours) to reduce inflammation. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy reduces bile duct injury and the percentage of conversion to open cholecystectomy. Thirty-five patients with acute cholecystitis were submitted to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, equally divided according to sex. All patients were submitted to US scans preoperatively and operated on by surgeons skilled in emergency laparoscopic operative techniques. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was always performed with 4 trochars and the use of a 30 degrees laparoscope. Technical modifications during early laparoscopic cholecystectomy were drainage and decompression with subsequent de-tension and distention of the gallbladder. These manoeuvres entailed the use of Babcock, Endopatch (Ethicon) atraumatic forceps. In the presence of acute gallbladder inflammation we dissect the gall-blader well with a suction-irrigation tube. In patients suspected of having common bile duct stones, biliary duct injuries and/or anatomical changes due to inflammation, we perform intraoperative cholangiography. Five patients had conversion to open cholecystectomy (14.2%), in two cases (5.7%) for concomitant choledochal stones, in two cases (5.7%) for biliary peritonitis and in the fifth case (2.8%) for severe empyema of the gallbladder. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 20 patients for acute cholecystitis (57.1%), in 9 patients for empyema (25.7%) and in 6 patients for gangrenous cholecystitis. Four cases presented postoperative complications owing to bile leakage from the liver bed, treated with antibiotic therapy. One patient presented jaundice on day 30 after laparoscopy owing to inadequate positioning of the clips on the cystic duct, near the common bile duct; ERCP was performed with application of a prosthesis, which was removed after two months. Our experience and results support the validity of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the treatment of acute cholecystitis, because it reduces the postoperative length of hospital stay and hospital costs. Early treatment is always helpful for inflamed and oedematous tissue which favours dissection, while dense, fibrotic adhesions hinder regular dissection with a greater risk of injury to the biliary duct and and a higher conversion rate to open cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,11452812,0,Laparoscopic pancreatic resection.,"The extent of reported laparoscopic resections vary from enucleation to pancreaticoduodenectomy. Although initial series have been reported with encouraging results, most patients with pancreatic disease requiring resection are still treated with an open approach. We present a review of our experience and of the world literature on laparoscopic pancreatic resection. Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy has been attempted in 12 patients with a conversion rate of 33%. Complications occurred in the laparoscopic group. The laparoscopic patients have experienced no benefit in the postoperative recovery and convalescence. Early experience with the hand-assisted approach is promising. Sixty-eight laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies and enucleations have been reported to date. They were 42 distal pancreatectomies and 26 enucleations. Thirteen procedures have been converted to open surgery (19.1%). There was no mortality and the main postoperative complication was pancreatic leak (5 patients, 7.3%). Average hospital stay was 9 days. These results compare favorably with the outcomes after open pancreatic resection. While laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy is not associated with patient benefit and may be accompanied by increased morbidity, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and enucleation are safe, carry low morbidity and have encouraging results in terms of postoperative recovery."

Nevertheless, most patients with pancreatic disease who require resection are still treated with a traditional approach. Technological advancements in recent years may play an important role for the future diffusion of laparoscopic pancreatectomy. In hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon inserts a hand into the abdomen through a small laparotomy while pneumoperitoneum is maintained, and uses the hand to assist with dissection, palpation and retraction, control of blood vessels, manipulation of organs, and removal of the specimen. We present a review of our experience and of the world literature on hand-assisted laparoscopic pancreatic resection. Based on the first encouraging results, we believe that the hand-assisted technique should allow for substantial advantages to laparoscopic pancreatic surgery in the future."
CD009323,0,11441398,0,Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery in the United States: an overview.,"Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) was developed to bridge the gap between open surgery and advanced laparoscopic surgery. Advantages of the hand in the abdomen include tactile feedback, the ability to palpate, blunt dissection, organ retraction, control of bleeding, and rapid organ removal. There are 3 commercially available devices in the United States, as well as a fourth in Europe and a fifth in Japan. Uses for HALS include procedures requiring intact specimen removal, complex laparoscopic procedures, preventing open conversion, and overcoming a technical obstacle. HALS procedures, such as esophagectomy, gastrectomy, hepatectomy, pancreatectomy, splenectomy, bariatric surgery, colectomy, nephrectomy, hysterectomy, and aortobifemoral bypass, have all been reported in the literature. Improvement in instrumentation, specifically with newer generation devices, will allow HALS to become more popular. We advocate the use of HALS specifically for laparoscopic colectomy, laparoscopic splenectomy for massive splenomegaly, and for living-related donor nephrectomy."
CD009323,0,11420845,0,[Aggressive surgical treatment for cholangiocarcinoma].,"Surgery remains the only curative approach to cholangiocarcinoma. Despite operative difficulties concerning tumor location, vascular involvement or hepatic invasion curative resection (i.e. achievement of tumor free margins) carries good survival rates and is associated with low morbidity and mortality. Our experience with 31 patients with cholangiocarcinoma operated during the years 1993-1999 is presented. Twenty-five patients were found to have hilar cholangiocarcinoma, 3 carcinoma of mid-choledochus and 3 distal cholangiocarcinoma. All patients were evaluated by a diagnostic protocol including laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound. Surgery consisted of local resection of the tumor with Roux en Y hepaticojejunostomy reconstruction. Three patients had concomitant hepatic resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma while 3 patients had pancreaticoduodenectomy for distal cholangiocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in all patients. Curative resection was achieved in 19 patients and palliative resection (microscopically involved resected margins) in 12. One patient died at 60 days postop (3.5% mortality). Postoperative complications included cholangitis occurring in 10 patients who were referred with biliary drains, intraabdominal abscess (2 patients) and biliary leakage (1 patient) all treated conservatively. Overall survival rate was 82% at one year, 73% at two years and 45% at 5 years. When comparing curative resection with palliative resection, survival rates were 92% versus 71% for 1 year, 72% versus 50% for 2 year and 57% versus 14% for 5 years. Selection of patients using Laparoscopic Ultrasound combined with aggressive surgical approach enable curative or palliative resection 15 the only treatment modality which is significantly improved survival."

CD009323,0,11398209,0,Role of video-laparoscopy in the staging of intra-abdominal lymphomas and gastrointestinal cancer.,"There is good category II/III evidence that video-laparoscopic staging is valuable in certain gastrointestinal (gastric, esophageal, pancreatic, and hepatobiliary) and intra-abdominal lymphomas, but no category I evidence (based on prospective randomized trials). The evidence available is all retrospective, but of sufficient consistency to indicate that laparoscopic staging adds to the primary (imaging) staging and often alters the clinical stage of the disease and hence the management of the individual patient. The advent of laparoscopic contact ultrasound (LCU) scanning has improved the staging accuracy for pancreatic and hepatobiliary neoplasms. The laparoscopic approach also offers a means of surgical palliation in certain patient groups. However, there are a number of unresolved issues concerning the use of video-laparoscopy. The most important concerns whether staging laparoscopy should be performed immediately before scheduled surgery or as a separate intervention. The cost-efficacy of these two management options needs to be evaluated in prospective studies. In some centres, laparoscopic staging is being conducted by gastroenterologists and hepatologists. This raises issues of safety and ability to undertake certain procedures that may be necessary during the laparoscopic staging."

The feasibility of videoendoscopically assisted transvaginal cystectomy was demonstrated several years ago, but the indications have been greatly reduced by the spreading use of orthotopic neobladders in women. Moreover, nulliparous patients or patients with vaginal atresia are not suitable for this technique, even if the specimen can also be retrieved through the minilaparotomy used for performing urinary diversion. In the last 3 years, we have performed only four additional cases. Nevetheless, the results are satisfactory. We did not have any major intraoperative complication. Patients were discharged after 7 to 11 days (average 8.6 days) without any postoperative complications. The minimum survival was 13 months, and four patients are still alive.

Although investigators once proclaimed that ""it seems unlikely that laparoscopy will have any more than an extremely limited use in the investigation of pancreatic disorders,"" laparoscopy and LUS now have a well-recognized role in the staging of pancreatic cancer and an increasing part in the management of benign pancreatic disease at many institutions. Although the appropriate role of LS and LUS is debatable, the development and refinement of laparoscopic techniques and instrumentation and the improvement of noninvasive diagnostic modalities will provide new data, increase the rate of resection at laparotomy, and allow surgeons to treat a broader range of pancreatic disease by minimally invasive methods. The value of LS and LUS for benign and malignant pancreatic disorders has been clearly demonstrated, but the inevitable issues of hospital resource, operative expertise, and surgical philosophy will ultimately determine the role of laparoscopy and LUS in clinical practice."
CD009323,0,11379654,0,Immediate and long-term outcomes after lateral pancreaticojejunostomy for chronic pancreatitis.,"Lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (LPJ) is the recommended surgical treatment of intractable pain from chronic pancreatitis (CP) with obstruction and ductal dilatation. This study evaluated the etiology, morbidity, mortality, hospital costs, and quality of life (QL) for patients with LPJ for CP. Medical records of 60 patients undergoing LPJ for CP between 1988 and 1996 were reviewed. Long-term QL was assessed by the Short Form 36 Health Survey and analyzed against control populations of patients who underwent pancreatic debridement for necrosis and patients with laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis. CP etiologies included 52 per cent alcoholic, 28 per cent idiopathic, 13 per cent pancreatic divisum, and 7 per cent familial pancreatitis. Peri- and postoperative morbidity and mortality were 25 and 0 per cent respectively. Average hospital cost was $13,530 with mean postoperative hospital stay of 12.1 days. Overall physical and mental QL were diminished compared with both the debridement group and cholecystectomy group with particular detriments in areas of physical role (P < 0.05), bodily pain (P < 0.001), social function (P < 0.001), and mental health (P < 0.001). We conclude that LPJ for CP is a relatively safe procedure with low morbidity and mortality but results in a significantly diminished long-term QL relative to other surgical patients with pancreatic or biliary disease. This difference prevails in both physical and mental aspects of health."

Serum chemistry values were normal. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was planned, and a mass encircling the common bile duct was found. The procedure was converted to an open operation, and cholecystectomy, mass excision, and hepaticojejunostomy were done. The specimen was interpreted as paraganglioma of the bile duct. There were no manifestations of catecholamine hypersecretion or signs of biliary obstruction. Six years later, the patient is asymptomatic without signs of recurrence.

CD009323,0,11370388,0,[Surgical treatment and outcome in insulinoma].,"In the therapy of organic hyperinsulinism, interest is mainly focussed on the surgical removal of the hyperactive tissue. In spite of these progresses, the surgical treatment is not devoid of problems. These comprise the primary untraceable insulinoma, multiple insulinomas, nesidioblastosis and reoperation. The development of laparoscopic surgery leads to new opportunities the rating of which must be defined. Solitary adenomas are causal for primary hyperinsulinism in 80% to 90% of cases. Intraoperative 87.5% of the tumors are palpable and 83% are detectable by ultrasound. By combination of both methods it is possible to remove 97% of the solitary tumors. Occult adenomas, which cannot be represented by preoperative imaging diagnostics are detectable through intraoperative methods in over 80% of cases by palpation or ultrasound respectively. By combination of both methods, 97% of these occult adenomas can be removed. This reliability of the intraoperative detection makes the preoperative localizing diagnostics unnecessary if no MEN-syndrome is present. If a MEN-syndrome is present, multiple adenomas are common. In 60% of cases multiple adenomas are responsible for the persistency of the syndrome after an unsuccessful primary operation. Therefore a preoperative localizing diagnostics is advisable in case of a MEN-syndrome. Multiple adenomas are treated by left-pancreatic resection with enucleation of remaining adenomas in the pancreatic head region. In case of an untraceable adenoma, the possibility of the rare nesidioblastosis should be considered. This rare occurrence can be detected by fresh frozen sectioning. The resection of 75% to 80% of the pancreas is recommended. The attempt of a laparoscopic removal of solitary adenomas may be indicated, taking into account all contraindications. The preliminary requisite for this is an experienced center in endocrine surgery as well as an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. Contraindications for the laparoscopic procedure are: a tumor localized in the head of the pancreas or in the dorsal parts of the organ, multiple adenomas and nesidioblastosis. In case of occult adenomas, laparoscopic therapy is problematic, as they are also difficult to detect intraoperatively through laparoscopy. The incidence of postoperative complications is still high with 30% and a mortality of 2%. Most often pancreatic fistulas (10%) and septic complications were seen."

CD009323,0,11356338,0,A critical appraisal of laparoscopic staging in hepatobiliary and pancreatic malignancy.,Prognosis for patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers is dismal. Surgery is the best therapeutic option for those with tumors which have not yet metastasized. Standard radiologic tests such as computed tomography (CT) scan and trans-abdominal ultrasound are useful in identifying patients for whom an attempt at resection would be futile. Staging laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasound allows greater precision in identifying those for whom resection would be helpful with less morbidity than an open exploration. Metastatic disease can be identified more precisely than with radiologic tests and can be characterized by biopsy techniques. Palliative procedures are now being performed laparoscopically with low morbidity and short hospital stays. The use of laparoscopy prior to open exploration for patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic tumors is advantageous.
CD009323,0,11353978,0,Accessory gallbladder originating from the right hepatic duct.,"A patient with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy after confirmation of the diagnosis by sonography. Intraoperative cholangiography was normal and the operation was completed laparoscopically. Due to the postoperative persistence of right upper abdominal pain, another sonogram and then an endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram (ERCP) were performed. To our surprise, an accessory gallbladder with a remaining gallstone was revealed. The accessory cystic duct was shown as arising directly from the right hepatic duct. The patient underwent a second laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but due to hemorrhaging the operation had to be converted to an open procedure. The two gallbladders and their corresponding cystic ducts and arteries were entirely separate. To our knowledge, this is the first publication of a duplicate gallbladder where the cystic duct arose directly from the right hepatic duct."

CD009323,0,11353961,0,The significance of cystic duct stones encountered during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Cystic duct stones (CDS) are occasionally encountered during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). They may be noticed during the dissection of the cystic pedicle or seen to extrude from the cystic duct (CD) when it is divided or opened to perform the intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC). The procedures for dealing with CDS range from the simple removal of stones that fall out when the duct is opened to incising the duct over an impacted stone to facilitate its removal or converting to open surgery due to a large stone in a CD adherent to the bile duct (e.g., Mirizzi syndrome). Therefore, we set out to establish criteria that might be predictive of CDS, to examine the technical problems caused by them, to look for the most effective ways of avoiding adverse consequences, especially the risk of missing bile duct stones."
CD009323,0,11351161,0,Three cases of small bowel intussusception in relation to a rare lesion: inflammatory fibrous polyps.,"Inflammatory fibrous polyps (IFPs), also known as inflammatory pseudotumors, occur rarely in the gastrointestinal tract. IFPs have variable presentations, often presenting as small bowel obstruction due to intussusception or, less commonly, as an incidental finding on radiological examinations or screening colonoscopies. The diagnosis and management of IFPs will be discussed through a review of the literature and a series of cases from our own institution."

CD009323,0,11330388,0,Laparoscopic gastrostomy: results of 121 patients over 7 years.,"Laparoscopic gastrostomy was introduced in various technical variants 7 years ago. However, larger series and long-term results of these new methods are still lacking. In a prospective study, laparoscopic gastrostomies were performed by two institutions in 121 patients (88 men, 33 women; mean age, 58.3 +/- 11.16 years [range, 24-82]) with esophageal stenosis in locally advanced hypopharyngeal or oropharyngeal carcinoma, incurable esophageal carcinoma, and cerebral dysphagia. Operating time was 40 +/- 22 (range, 10-160) minutes. Procedure-related mortality was 0%, early mortality was 1.6%, the overall intraoperative complication rate was 7.4%, and the early complication rate was 9.9%. During a cumulative usage time of 1086.2 months, the complication rate in 1000 usage days was 0.8, and the stoma infection rate was 0.65. Laparoscopic gastrostomy is a reliable method for safe and economic establishment of enteral nutrition, even in patients for whom long-term nutrition by gastrostomy is expected."
CD009323,0,11330383,0,Laparoscopic excision of retroperitoneal tumors: technique and review of the laparoscopic experience.,"A technique for laparoscopic excision of benign retroperitoneal tumors, including a teratoma and two cystic lesions, is described. Laparoscopic resection of a 12-cm retroperitoneal teratoma was accomplished with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. Medial mobilization of the ascending colon and the duodenum was required for access to the lesion. Resections of two cystic lesions (measuring 20 cm and 12 cm) were performed with the patients in the lithotomy position. The colon required medial mobilization in both cases to gain access to the cysts. Once the cysts were dissected from surrounding structures, they were punctured, and the aspirated fluid was sent for cytologic analysis. There were no complications or conversions. Mean operating time was 122 minutes (range, 80-190). Patients were discharged 1 day after surgery, requiring only nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications for analgesia. Retroperitoneal tumors can be resected laparoscopically with careful preoperative investigation and meticulous laparoscopic technique. A major advantage of laparoscopic resections is that the patient recovers rapidly with minimal morbidity."
CD009323,0,11330382,0,Hand-assisted laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with minilaparotomy for distal pancreatic cystadenoma.,"Two patients with cystic tumors of the pancreas treated by laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy are presented. The first patient was a 34-year-old woman with a 6-cm cystadenoma of the tail of the pancreas treated with a complete laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. After mobilization of the distal pancreas and spleen, the pancreas was transected proximally together with the splenic artery and vein using an endoscopic linear stapler. The second patient was a 71-year-old woman with a 6-cm cystadenoma of the body of the pancreas, treated by hand-assisted laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with minilaparotomy because the tumor was adjacent to the portal vein and celiac axis. Using an upper median minilaparotomy, dissection of the gastrocolic ligament, division of the splenic artery, and transection and closure of the pancreas were performed. Division of the splenic vein and mobilization of the distal pancreas and spleen were performed via a hand-assisted laparoscopic approach. There were no postoperative complications (such as pancreatic fistulas) in either patient, and the postoperative courses were uneventful. The patients returned to normal activity within 1 week after the operation. Complete laparoscopic and hand-assisted laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy are preferable to conventional open surgery for benign tumors of the pancreas because of their less-invasive nature. Additionally, in tumors of the body of the pancreas, hand-assisted laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy might have the advantages of laparotomy and laparoscopy in terms of handling the splenic artery and vein just below the minilaparotomy site, suggesting an easier and safer procedure than complete laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. Therefore, hand-assisted laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy can be recommended as a useful alternative to complete laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for selected patients with benign tumors of the body and tail of the pancreas."
CD009323,0,11327135,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: fundus-down approach.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the primary treatment of gallstone disease. Although refinements have made it safer, bile duct injury remains more common than with the open approach. The major difference in these techniques is that open cholecystectomy approaches the gallbladder from the fundus downward, whereas conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy proceeds in the reverse direction. A handful of fundus-down techniques appear in the literature. The use of special instruments or port sites is common. We present a technique that is safe and utilizes instruments familiar to the surgeon performing conventional LC."
CD009323,0,11325001,0,Biliary-colonic fistula through a cystic duct stump.,"Biliary-colonic fistulas are a known, but unusual, complication of gallstone disease. Fistulas occurring after cholecystectomy between cystic duct stump (CDS) and the colon are extremely rare; only two cases have been previously reported in the literature. We report a third case, and discuss the diagnostic work-up and management of this entity."
CD009323,0,11323765,0,Diagnostic and therapeutic choledochoscopy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and common bile duct exploration are common surgical procedures for the general surgeon. To successfully remove common bile duct stones, choledochoscopy is an important technique for efficient and effective management. The choledochoscope can be introduced intraoperatively through the cystic duct or directly into the common bile duct and it also can be inserted transhepatically through a T-tube tract and per orally using a therapeutic duodenoscope. All of these methods allow for many options for the surgeon to consider, and one must be familiar with each of these techniques to maximize care. Successful stone extraction with the choledochoscope can be achieved in 75% to 95% of the cases with a morbidity less than 5%. Using this technique, the surgeon can improve the cost benefit of bile duct exploration."
CD009323,0,11323764,0,Prospective trials in laparoscopic bile duct exploration.,"Laparoscopic exploration of the common bile duct (CBD) is performed either for the diagnosis or the treatment of CBD stones. Laparoscopic intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) versus ultrasonography (LUS) and laparoscopic versus endoscopic extraction of CBD stones were compared through a review of the prospective, comparative studies, randomized or not, evaluating these different techniques. Cystic duct cholangiography and fluoroscopic imaging are the standards for IOC. The potential protective effect of IOC regarding the risk or severity of CBD injuries might be the major argument for a routine use of laparoscopic IOC. Most if not all the purported advantages of LUS versus IOC for the diagnosis of CBD stones remain to be proven. Laparoscopic intraoperative diagnosis of CBD stones by cholangiography or ultrasonography followed by the laparoscopic extraction or, in case of failure, by postoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy, might represent the future for the diagnosis and treatment of CBD stones."
CD009323,0,11323762,0,"Ductal stones: pathology, clinical manifestations, laparoscopic extraction techniques, and complications.","Laparoscopic treatment of ductal calculi in experienced hands is more successful and incurs a shorter hospital stay and overall costs than current orthodox two-stage management (endoscopic stone extraction followed by cholecystectomy). The results of large series of laparoscopic ductal stone clearance report a median success rate of 90%, a mortality under 1%, and a missed stone rate of 0.8% to 4%. Thus the case for routine preoperative endoscopic stone extraction is no longer sustainable and this management option should be reserved for patients with cholangitis, severe gallstone-associated pancreatitis, and for patients considered unfit for surgery and general anesthesia. The remaining issues concern standardization of the techniques of laparoscopic ductal stone extraction and the intraoperative management algorithm with agreed indications for transcystic extraction versus direct common bile duct (CBD) exploration. Narrowed bile ducts should not be explored directly, and if the transcystic laparoscopic approach fails in these cases, endoscopic extraction is the safest option, either at the time of surgery under the same anesthetic or during the postoperative period. The insertion of a T-tube after direct common duct exploration detracts considerably from the benefits of the laparoscopic approach, and primary closure with either a cystic duct drainage cannula or by means of a temporary endobiliary stent is recommended."
CD009323,0,11320482,0,Minimally invasive management of hepatic metastases.,"The introduction of laparoscopy for diagnosis of abdominal tumors has also allowed for the destruction of hepatic metastases by cryotherapy and radiofrequency ablation. The advantage of laparoscopically based therapy over the percutaneous treatment is the benefit of finding additional lesions that preoperative studies may not have detected. The results from available data in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma suggest an improvement in survival. Tumor ablation in patients offers an 18- to 36-month median survival and the possibility of 50% and 24% survival rates at 2 and 5 years, respectively. Patients with metastases from melanoma, breast, esophagus, lung, stomach, pancreas, and gynecologic malignancies have historically not demonstrated improved survival after hepatic resection. The value of hepatic tumor ablation for metastases from these lesions remains undetermined."
CD009323,0,11320477,0,Strategies for laparoscopic diagnosis of malignancy.,"Accurate cancer diagnosis and staging are crucial to the determination of an efficacious treatment plan for localized and advanced malignancy. The physician must differentiate patients with potentially resectable, localized disease from those with advanced and/or distant disease. The diagnostic and staging modalities currently available are expensive and often inaccurate. This can result in the nonoperative management of potentially resectable malignancies or, more commonly, in an underestimation of the preoperative cancer stage with intraoperative evidence of advanced/metastatic disease. The combination of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography can be used to help diagnose and stage malignancies and select patients for either curative or palliative procedures."
CD009323,0,11319455,0,[Radiofrequency for the treatment of liver tumors].,"Radiofrequency is performed with thin electrodes that are placed in the center of a tumor under ultrasonographic guidance. Radiofrequency waves induce ionic agitation which destroys neighboring tissues by heat. The most recent equipment can produce necrosis of 4-cm diameter areas. Efficacy is enhanced by blocking intrahepatic blood flow which naturally refreshes the liver parenchyma. The technique has the advantage of minimal invasion and of sparing liver parenchymal tissue. radiofrequency can be performed percutaneously or by laparoscopi or laparotomy. results in most reported series have been good with low morbidity. rapid improvment of material and of new associated procedures (vascular clamping, cooling infusion of the bile ducts, transplaeurodiaphragmatic approach, combination with other new approaches in liver surgery) are continuously modifying performance levels and potential indications curently under validation. radiofrequency, like other tools for local tumor destruction, will greatly change our therapeutic strategies in the neat future."

CD009323,0,11299399,0,Laparoscopic colectomy. Where do we stand?,"Laparoscopy has changed our approach to surgery, instrumentation and training. The techniques are evolving for a wide range of surgical procedures outside the biliary tree. Currently available data suggests that laparoscopic colectomy can be completed safely in most cases. It is feasible and offers patient-related benefits similar to those described for other laparoscopic procedures. The advisability of performing laparoscopy for cure of colorectal malignancy has been challenged because the recurrence rates and overall cure rates remain unknown. Until prospective randomized trials resolve these issues neoplastic colon laparoscopic surgery must be the prerogative of selected and specialized centers."
CD009323,0,11287999,0,The role of laparoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of intestinal duplication in childhood. A report of two cases.,"In children, the diagnostic approach for cystic abdominal tumors (e.g., intestinal duplication) usually includes CT scan, ultrasound (US), and MRI. In small children and babies, the diagnosis is often made by laparotomy. We present our preliminary experience with laparoscopic-assisted surgery (LAS) in two girls. Both children underwent US as the diagnostic approach using imaging techniques. If an intraabdominal mass was identified as cystic or solid, the second step was diagnostic laparoscopy with LAS. One of the girls, a 9-year-old, had a history of appendectomy and abdominal cramps. US revealed a cystic structure in the right lower quadrant. Laparoscopy showed an intestinal duplication, which was mobilized; a segmental small bowel resection was then performed. The second girl, a (6-month-old,) had an antenatal diagnosed cystic mass. A small bowel duplication was found laparoscopically, completely mobilized and excised, and harvested through a small umbilical incision. The postop course was uneventful. In former times, transverse laparotomy and Pfannenstil incision were the most common surgical approaches. LAS combines an excellent means of exploration with the simultaneous performance of definitive surgery. Perfect cosmetic results can be achieved even in children with rare pathology."
CD009323,0,11287991,0,Common bile duct obstruction secondary to a balloon separated from a Fogarty vascular embolectomy catheter during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic instrumentation of the common bile duct (CBD) via the transcystic route or through direct choledochotomy seems to be safe, but in rare cases, complications such as pancreatitis, bile duct damage, and hemorrhage from cystic artery may occur. We report an unusual complication with this approach. A 62-year-old man with gallbladder stones presented with obstructive jaundice, mild pancreatitis, and a dilated CBD. He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with an intraoperative cholangiogram through the cystic duct. A small stone seen in the CBD was removed using a 6-Fr vascular Fogarty catheter. Two days later, he became jaundiced again with a rising bilirubin. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram showed a 1.5-cm round filling defect floating in a dilated CBD. A sphincterotomy was performed, and a balloon catheter was inflated proximally and pulled down. To our surprise, the filling defect was a crystal clear object, which we finally realized was a fully inflated Fogarty catheter balloon. The balloon spontaneously deflated while being caught with a basket. Surgeons should be aware of this possible complication, and every effort should be made to verify that the balloon still is in place after removal of the embolectomy catheter. Whether vascular embolectomy catheter balloons are appropriate for stone removal or more rigid balloons should be used needs further evaluation."
CD009323,0,11287989,0,Clip migration causes choledocholithiasis after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"The migration of surgical clips after laparoscopic procedures was first reported in 1992, but such instances are extremely rare. We herein demonstrate a case of a migrated metal clip, which had been applied originally to the cystic duct, but thereafter had moved to the common bile duct. This clip caused choledocholithiasis in a patient 1 year after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A 63-year-old man underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. During the operation, the inflamed cystic duct was divided accidentally, and three clips were applied immediately. The patient complained of upper abdominal pain from postoperative day 8. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography demonstrated bile leakage from the cystic duct, but showed no clips or choledochal stones. The patient complained of severe upper abdominal and back pain 1 year after the operation. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed a metal clip in the common bile duct and choledochal stones above the clip. The clip and the cholesterol stones were removed using a basket catheter. Three clips applied to the cystic duct should have been removed because of the necrosis in the remaining cystic duct. Thereafter, the clip may have migrated through the stump of the cystic duct into the lower part of the common bile duct. This clip seems to have later caused choledocholithiasis resulting from stagnation of the bile flow. Bile leakage after an operation seems to increase the risk of clip migration. Regardless of the primary lesion, a careful follow-up evaluation is necessary for patients demonstrating complications."
CD009323,0,11285960,0,A critical analysis of intraoperative time utilization in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Most of the expense of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is incurred while the patient is in the operation room; however, heretofore there has been no critical analysis of the time required to perform the various steps of the operation. An understanding of how operative time is used is the first step toward improving the efficiency of the procedure and decreasing costs while maintaining an acceptable standard of care."
CD009323,0,11285528,0,An unusual complication after percutaneous drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst into the stomach.,"In the period between September 1995 and June 1999, we performed percutaneous drainage into the stomach in 12 patients. There were no complications or pseudocyst recurrences on insertion or after endoscopic removal of the catheter, which was left in site for 1 year on average. After endoscopic removal of the drainage catheter, one of the patients presented with a cystic formation in the stomach wall, which caused stomach emptying disorder. Therefore, the patient had to be reoperated. The cyst wall was incised and a part of the cystic wall sampled for histological examination. The cyst was then drained into the isolated Roux loop of the jejunum. Histological findings of the cystic wall specimen showed the presence of granulation tissue and smooth muscle layers with ganglia cells of myenteric nerve plexus. Despite this complication, we believe that percutaneous endoscopically and ultrasonographically guided drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst into the stomach by means of a double pigtail catheter is a good method that yields encouraging results in sonographically selected cases. The position of the drainage catheter needs to be checked endoscopically, and the catheter should be removed only after 1 year."
CD009323,0,11285527,0,Pancreatic pseudocyst treated by laparoscopic Roux-en-Y cystojejunostomy. Report of a case and review of the literature.,"Advances in laparoscopic surgical technique and instrumentation have furthered our ability to perform more complex laparoscopic procedures. We report the case of a 45-year-old man in whom a giant pancreatic pseudocyst developed after biliary pancreatitis. He underwent laparoscopic internal drainage by a Roux-en-Y cyst-jejunal anastomosis after unsuccessful percutaneous drainage. The surgical technique and a review of the current literature is presented. We conclude that although laparoscopic internal drainage technically is feasible in selected cases, additional data are required to define the role of this surgical approach in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts."

The aim of this work was to examine their frequency and to assess potential associated danger when performing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A retrospective analysis of clinical charts of 3.870 patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy between 1959 and 1997 was performed. Eighteen cases of choledoco-duodenal fistula, 9 of cholecysto-duodenal and 12 of cholecysto-choledochal fistulas were observed. Two cases of acquired absence of the cystic duct and one cholecysto-colic fistula were also encountered. The traditional contrastographic radiology showed to be more accurate in defining presence and nature of the acquired anomalies. Etiopathogenesis of the main anomalies and consequent risks in performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were discussed."

LS is done using a R. Wolf laparoscope, and LE--with a 7.5 MHz linear transducer, obtained from the Aloka Company. A total of 250 patients presenting 288 nodular hepatocellular lesions are investigated over 15 years (1983-1998), including: focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)--1, nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH)--1, hepatocellular adenoma (HCA)--1, adenomatous hyperplasia (AH)--38, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)--58, Budd-Chiari syndrome--2, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSCh)--2, and cirrhosis of liver--185. The lesions are distributed according to the updated classification of the International Working Party, published in 1995. In addition to the latter, a case of cholangiocellular adenoma undergoing malignant degeneration and a case presenting carcinoma, giving rise to differential diagnostic difficulties are also described. Some of the aforementioned diseases are reported for the first time in the Bulgarian literature. Emphasis is laid on the practicability of combining endoscopic with imaging diagnostics, attributable to laparoscopic echography and to the advantages of echolaparoscopic biopsy. Almost half of the foci (46.1%) are morphologically verified. The aim of cytological assessment is to establish the malignant character of the lesion, first and foremost, while the histological finding is essential for making a correct diagnosis."
CD009323,0,11246991,0,[The C tube in biliary surgery--its development and clinical application].,"The T tube procedure for bile drainage after biliary surgery has been used all over the world for more than 90 years. However, this method has serious drawbacks: a high complication ratio and a need for long-term hospitalization. Therefore other bile drainage methods including PTGBD, PTBD and ENBD have been developed, but none has so far been able to replace T tube. We have developed a new technique for bile drainage using the C tube (cystic duct tube), which is a slender tube (6Fr. polyvinyl) inserted via the cystic duct into the common bile duct (CBD). We have used C tube in more than 400 cases over the last 20 years: for open surgery during the first 10 years, and for laparoscopic surgery in the last 10 years. Here we describe the history of improvements in the C tube method and the techniques of C tube application in biliary surgery. Elastic surgical suture has been used to fix the C tube to the cystic duct, which successfully prevented bile leakage from the ductal stump after withdrawal of the tube. C tube is not only used for postoperative bile drainage but also for the management of remnant stones. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and benefits of the C tube procedure."
CD009323,0,11242914,0,[Aggressive surgical approach in pancreatic cancer--is it justified?].,"Resection presents the only possible cure for pancreatic cancer. An aggressive surgical approach may extend the limits of resection and offer cure for more patients. 37 women and 28 men, mean age 67 years (range 33-84) with focal lesions underwent pancreatic resection (1993-1999). Cancer of the pancreatic head was found in 45, in the ampulla in 4 and in the body or tail in 16. There was a tumor larger than 5 cm in 9, vascular involvement in 8, and a combination of both in 6. All were evaluated prior to exploration by standard imaging techniques and 44 by laparoscopic ultrasound. 42 underwent pancreatico-duodenectomy, 16 distal subtotal pancreatectomy and 3 local excision of an ampullary tumor. Benign lesions were found in 8 (focal pancreatitis in 4 and a serous cystic lesion in 4). Curative resection (microscopically negative margins, negative lymph nodes) was achieved in 44. 2 died 1-2 months after operation of septic complications (2% operative mortality). The most frequent complication (in 8) was pancreatic fistula. Additional complications included anastomotic-line bleeding (3), intra-abdominal abscess (2), and 1 developed portal vein thrombosis (treated surgically). 1- and 2-year survival in those after curative pancreatic resection was 81% and 55% respectively. 2-year survival in those after palliative resection (positive resection margins or positive lymph nodes) was 50% and 11%, respectively. After proper selection of those in whom it is possible to perform curative resection, regardless of size or vascular involvement, an aggressive surgical approach is justified."

CD009323,0,11236272,0,[Laparoscopic treatment of common bile duct lithiasis].,"With the advances of videolaparoscopic surgery, this approach had become the treatment of choice for cholelithiasis. However, about 5% to 10% may present common bile duct lithiasis. Most surgeons have still difficulties to deal with this situation and do prefer resolve with open surgery or with further endoscopic approach. We present a case of a 60-year-old man, with 18 months history of right upper quadrant pain, weight loss and jaundice. He was referred with diagnostic of pancreatic cancer. Laboratory investigation showed increased bilirubin (10 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase and GGT. Abdominal ultrasound showed atrophic gallbladder with dilated intra and extrahepatic biliary tree. Computerized tomography scan disclosed enlarged biliary tree with 3 cm stone in the distal common bile duct. The patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy followed by choledochotomy and retrieval of the large stone. A latero-lateral choledochoduodenum anastomosis was then performed to decompress the biliary tree. The patient had an uneventful recovery being discharged at the 6th postoperative day. Laparoscopic management of choledocholithiasis is feasible in many patients, specially those with dilated biliary tree. The retrieval of stones may be followed by biliary drainage with T-tube. In some elderly patients with chronically dilated common bile duct, as in the present case, a choledochoduodenal anastomosis is the procedure of choice."

The importance of complex ultrasonic diagnosis in detection of pancreatic diseases (98%), in true diagnosis of unresectable tumors (96.7%), and also in determination of bile ducts lesion level in obstructive jaundice is shown. It was revealed that spiral computed tomography (SCT) had an advantage over computed tomography in diagnosis of pancreatic tumors and in assessment of their resectability. Sensitivity of combined use of US, SCT and tumor marker CA 19-9 in pancreatic cancer diagnosis increases to 95.2%. High diagnostic value of laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasonic examination as a method of final assessment of tumor resectability is shown."

CD009323,0,11216434,0,[Significance of staging laparoscopy in pancreatic carcinoma: a case report].,"Accurate staging of pancreatic malignancy is essential to properly plan appropriate therapy. The purpose of preoperative staging of intraabdominal malignancies is to identify patients in whom malignancies are unresectable and therefore would not be candidates for curative surgery. Routine preoperative evaluation of intraabdominal malignancies typically include abdominal helical computed tomographic (CT) scanning and/or ultrafast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. In fact both investigations are considered mandatory for intraabdominal malignancies. But despite modern techniques a significant number of false negative results occur (more than 20%). This has led to the investigation of additional staging modalities to better identify patients with unresectable disease. In this purpose we present the case of a patient with pancreatic carcinoma. After preoperative imaging (ultrasound, endosonography and MRI) there was no evidence for metastatic disease (uT3uN1). He underwent laparoscopy and a hepatic lesion was detected, histologically consistent with a liver metastasis. In this patient an unnecessary laparotomy could be avoided. In conclusion laparoscopy is an important tool in the staging of intraabdominal malignancy for patients with locally advanced disease without signs of tumor spread in CT or MRT. It is a relatively simple, well-tolerated and safe procedure and decreases the rate of unnecessary laparotomies. It should be considered in all patients with pancreatic malignancy in whom laparotomy is planned, either to establish the diagnosis or before an attempt at curative resection."
CD009323,0,11216431,0,[Laparoscopic tumor staging in gastrointestinal carcinomas: significance of internal medicine laparoscopy].,This study was performed to assess the role of additional diagnostic laparoscopy in the preoperative staging of patients with gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer prior to intended curative surgery. Furthermore patients with ascites of unknown origin were evaluated. 127 patients with primary solid abdominal tumors were eligible for evaluation; of those 66 patients had a gastric cancer and 61 a pancreatic cancer. Patients without histologically proven metastases proceeded to laparotomy. Ascites of unknown origin was the indication for performing a diagnostic laparoscopy in 23 patients. Metastases were detectable laparoscopically in 13 of 66 patients (20%) with gastric cancer. Intraoperatively metastases were evident in further 7 cases. In 14 of 61 patients (23%) with pancreatic cancer metastases were detected by laparoscopy and in further 5 patients intraoperatively. A peritoneal carcinosis was diagnosed laparoscopically in 17 of 23 patients with ascites of unknown origin. Preoperative staging by additional diagnostic laparoscopy proved effective in patients with gastric- and pancreatic cancer.
CD009323,0,11216428,0,[Laparoscopy in differential internal medicine diagnosis].,"Diagnostic laparoscopy has still important implications in the differential diagnosis of numerous diseases despite the impact of non invasive imaging procedures. One of the most important indication, besides chronic liver diseases, is staging of malignancies. Laparoscopy improves considerably the predictability whether a distal carcinoma of the esophagus, or a stomach cancer or a pancreatic carcinoma can be resected. Laparoscopy is unbeaten in diagnosing peritoneal metastases. Thus, laparoscopy prevents unnecessary explorative laparotomies. Regarding tumor staging, a comparison is mandatory between minilaparoscopy, conventional laparoscopy in analgosedation performed by the gastroenterologist and laparoscopy in intubation anesthesia performed by the surgeon immediately before planned laparotomy. The significance of minilaparoscopy especially regarding chronic liver diseases and correct diagnosis of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis will certainly increase. Laparoscopy remains to be an important diagnostic tool in diseases of unknown causes, i.e. fever of unknown origin. Laparoscopic sonography is the most sensitive method to detect small liver tumors, such as metastases or multilocular hepatocellular carcinoma."
CD009323,0,11206888,0,Mirizzi's syndrome: experience from a multi-institutional review.,"P.L. Mirizzi described in 1948 a partial or spastic obstruction of the common hepatic duct secondary to an impacted gallstone in the cystic duct or infundibulum of the gallbladder. The modern definition of Mirizzi's syndrome is thought to include four components: anatomic arrangement of the cystic duct at the gallbladder neck such that it runs parallel to the common hepatic duct; impaction of a stone in the cystic duct or neck of the gallbladder; mechanical obstruction of the common hepatic duct by the stone itself or by secondary inflammation; and intermittent or constant jaundice causing possible recurrent cholangitis and, if longstanding, secondary biliary cirrhosis. Intermittent symptomatology may make Mirizzi's syndrome difficult to diagnose preoperatively or intraoperatively. Bilio-biliary fistulas may or may not be present. Diagnosis and choice of operative repair may be best accomplished by open operative technique. Over a 24-year period two faculty members from Louisiana State University (LSU) Medical Center-Shreveport at Monroe and LSU Baton Rouge treated 4180 cases of cholelithiasis at six Louisiana university and private hospitals. Eleven cases of Mirizzi's syndrome were diagnosed on the basis of operative and preoperative notes with detailed description of size and extent of biliobiliary fistulas when they were present. These 11 cases were reviewed and followed from one to 20 years. Presentation, workup, operative findings, choice of operative repair, choice of operative approach, and complications were evaluated by retrospective chart review. Review of the pertinent literature for informative and comparative purposes was also completed. These 11 cases ranged from Csendes Type I to III. There were no Type IV cases. They were ultimately diagnosed and managed by classical open technique. Four laparoscopic procedures were converted to open technique following initial inspection. All four were converted to open as a result of inability to delineate structures in and adjacent to the triangle of Calot due to marked scarring in the subhepatic space. No iatrogenic injuries or major complications occurred. Mirizzi's syndrome occurs in fewer than 0.5 per cent of patients with cholelithiasis. Removal of stones with partial cholecystectomy and use of gallbladder or cystic duct remnant to oversew or repair Mirizzi fistulas should be considered. Roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy becomes the procedure of choice when the vascularity or viability of the hepatic duct or tissues available for duct repair is questionable. Review of the literature reveals the increase in complications with laparoscopic versus open technique in Mirizzi's syndrome. Although very little direct evidence exists we believe that when this syndrome is diagnosed or strongly suspected open biliary operation is the procedure of choice because the increased potential for major complications with the use of laparoscopic technique far outweighs the potential slight increase in morbidity of an open procedure."
CD009323,0,11206832,0,The impact of laparoscopic biopsy of pancreatic lymph nodes with helium and carbon dioxide on port site and liver metastasis in BOP-induced pancreatic cancer in hamster.,"The influence of pancreatic biopsy during laparoscopy with carbon dioxide (CO2) and helium on the incidence of port site and liver metastasis in pancreatic carcinoma is still unknown. Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas was induced in Syrian hamsters (n = 30) by injection of N-nitrosobis-2-oxopropylamin (BOP, 10 mg/kg body weight/week) for 12 weeks. In week 13, hamsters were randomized in 3 groups (n = 10): While in group 1 (gr. 1) a laparotomy and biopsy of pancreatic lymph nodes was performed, gr. 2 and gr. 3 underwent a laparoscopic biopsy either with CO2 or helium. Therefore, one trocar was located in the left (biopsy) and the right abdominal wall (camera). In the 18th week all animals were sacrificed and the incidence of abdominal wall, port site and liver metastases was histologically determined. While there were abdominal wall metastases after laparotomy in 10% (n = 1), we observed trocar metastases in the CO2 group in 20% (n = 2). However, there were no trocar metastases in the helium group. The incidence of liver metastasis did not differ between the laparotomy and the helium group (20% vs 30%), but was increased in the CO2 group (60%). Laparoscopic biopsy of pancreatic lymph nodes with CO2 increased the incidence of port site and liver metastases in pancreatic cancer. The helium group was equal to the laparotomy group in this respect. Thus, staging laparoscopy with helium might become an alternative to explorative laparotomy in pancreatic cancer."
CD009323,0,11204988,0,Diagnostic laparoscopy.,"The value of surgical laparoscopy for various therapeutic interventions has been well established. In recent years, the interest of gastroenterologists in this method has revived, since laparoscopy can provide additional information for the staging of oncological and liver diseases. The introduction of miniature lenses may have contributed to this process, and an increasing number of physicians are using minilaparoscopy due to its safety and easy handling. Surgical studies have mainly focused on the evaluation of laparoscopic ultrasound for the detection of liver and lymph-node metastases. In specialized centers, laparoscopic ultrasound is also used for the estimation of locoregional pancreatic tumor spread, but the diagnostic impact of the method, particularly in colorectal carcinoma, still remains to be determined. Remarkably, the number of publications from gastroenterology departments has tended to increase in comparison with last year's review."
CD009323,0,11201005,0,Gallbladder carcinoma and surgical treatment.,"Gallbladder carcinoma shows an unusual geographic and demographic distribution. It is relatively uncommon in Europe, but more frequent in Israel, Chile, Bolivia and in Southwestern Native Americans in the United States. Chronic cholecystitis, choledochal cysts, high body mass index, female gender, age, nicotine and industrial exposure to carcinogens are associated risk factors. The frequency of gallbladder cancer in all operations of the biliary tract is about 1-3%, reflecting the commonest biliary tract malignancy. Preoperative imaging, including ultrasound and computed tomography (CT), may reveal signs indicative of the presence of malignancy. However, most patients are not diagnosed prior to surgical intervention. Survival depends on the ability to achieve a curative resection, including hepatectomy and lymph node dissection in patients with local extended tumour according to the stage of the disease. Overall, the curative resection rates for gallbladder carcinoma range from 10% to 30%. Regional and para-aortic lymphadenectomy provides no survival benefit for patients with para-aortic disease, which has a negative influence on prognosis equivalent to that of distant metastases. A survival benefit is seen only in selected patients with metastases limited to the regional nodes. Taking a sample biopsy of the para-aortic nodes before starting surgery is recommended because these nodes are involved more frequently than expected. For those patients with unresectable cancer, palliative surgical, endoscopic or radiological bypass procedures can improve quality of life. Other approaches to the management of advanced tumours include systemic chemotherapy or combined chemo-radiotherapy and need further evaluation. Early-stage tumours are often discovered as an incidental finding during (laparoscopic) cholecystectomy or on histological examination of the gallbladder, mostly necessitating relaparotomy and extensive resection. In the following, management of patients with gallbladder cancer at different stages and situations is discussed."
CD009323,0,11180869,0,Hyperplastic polyp of the gallbladder in a child.,"We report a case of hyperplastic polyp of the gallbladder in a 6-year-old girl, successfully treated by laparoscopic cholecyctectomy after a 2-year follow-up from the original diagnosis. On her first admission, serum amylase level was very high, so that congenital pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM) was suspected. Although it became clear afterwards that the high serum amylase level was derived from a mumps infection, the diagnosis of PBM was not excluded until intraoperative cholangiography was conducted. The tumor in the gallbladder had doubled in size in 2 years. It was not possible to obtain biopsy specimens for histological diagnosis, so the risk of the tumor being malignant could not be completely excluded until surgical resection had been carried out. In spite of the rapid tumor growth, no neoplastic features were seen in the tumor by histopathological examination of the resected specimen; thus, a diagnosis of a hyperplastic polyp of the gallbladder was made."
CD009323,0,11172135,0,Postlaparoscopic small bowel obstruction secondary to unrecognized nodular endometriosis of the terminal ileum.,"Small bowel involvement by endometriosis occurs in about 0.5% of patients, but nodular endometriosis involving the entire wall of the terminal ileum is extremely rare. Endometriotic nodules protruding into the intestinal lumen may lead to chronic, partial, or acute complete small bowel obstruction and associated clinical changes. If obstruction is partial, preoperative diagnosis is difficult and seldom suspected, and no reliable diagnostic tests are available. At laparoscopic surgery, performed typically for associated pelvic endometriosis, bowel lesions may easily be overlooked, especially in women with abdominal adhesions from earlier surgery. Surgical injury, tension tears, or postoperative edema may contribute in such cases to the development of acute, complete small bowel obstruction, which may be difficult to differentiate from postoperative ileus. The patient may deteriorate rapidly and develop abdominal sepsis and multiple organ failure with high risk of mortality. Because of increased production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha by autologous monocytes, endometriosis may predispose to development of severe sepsis and septic shock.

Forty-five patients referred for LSC, who had undergone 3D-CT cholangiography and ERC simultaneously, participated in the study. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and 3D-CT cholangiography were compared in each patient with regard to opacification of the biliary tree, stones, and anatomic variations. Three-dimensional helical CT cholangiography and ERC imaging for predicting operative difficulties in LSC also were compared. The common bile duct and cystic duct were shown in the patients by the images, but the gallbladder was shown in 43 patients (96%) with use of 3D-CT cholangiography and in 36 patients (80%) with use of ERC. A third or more peripheral branches were shown completely with use of 3D-CT cholangiography in 33 patients (73%) and in 32 patients (71%) with use of ERC. Cystic duct stones were found in two of three patients with use of 3D-CT cholangiography and ERC. Common bile duct stones in five of seven patients were detected with use of 3D-CT cholangiography, but all of the common bile duct stones were detected with use of ERC. Anatomic variations of the bile duct were shown in three of four patients by 3D-CT cholangiography and in all patients with use of ERC. No significant differences in findings of the angle of bifurcation and presence of Heister valves between operative easy and complex cases were shown by 3D-CT cholangiography and ERC, despite the more accurate assessment of the cystic duct anatomy with use of 3D-CT cholangiography than with use of ERC. Three-dimensional helical CT cholangiography is useful clinically in preoperative assessment of biliary anatomy, but it is not reliable in the detection of common bile duct stones, and it is not helpful in predicting technical difficulty during LSC."

Triphasic spiral CT (4 ml s-1) and MRI (axial T1 weighted turbo spin echo with and without fat suppression, T1 weighted gradient echo and T2 weighted turbo spin echo at 1.5 T) were performed. All sequences were repeated following contrast medium using the same instrument settings as in the unenhanced sequences. Mn-DPDP was administered by slow injection of 5 mumol kg-1 body weight. Imaging results were correlated with surgery, laparoscopy, biopsy and/or follow-up. Eight pancreatic adenocarcinomas were present. Ten patients had chronic pancreatitis, and two showed a stenosing papillitis. CT detected eight malignant lesions and MRI detected seven. One pancreatic cancer was not detected with MRI. CT and MRI excluded malignancy in nine patients. MRI and CT returned three false positive results. Mn-DPDP improved delineation of the lesion, resulting in a higher level of diagnostic confidence. Differentiation between pseudotumorous lesions in chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma was difficult due to similar slight contrast enhancement. Owing to better delineation of the lesion and the higher confidence in diagnosis, MRI with Mn-DPDP may have the potential to improve the detection rate and the staging accuracy of focal pancreatic lesions. These results need to be confirmed in a larger patient trial."

CD009323,0,11144069,0,[Gallbladder cancer in the age of laparoscopic surgery].,"In routine post operative microscopic test of unsuspected of cancer gallbladder--before or during laparoscopic cholecystectomy--cancer is recognized in 0.5% to 1%. Bad prognosis is mainly connected with how far advanced the cancer is. It seems that laparoscopic technic it is a disadvantage itself as it conduces to dissemination of cancer in peritoneal cavity and also in cicatrix. Our experience so far proofs that repeatedly during the second traditional operation--even up to several days after laparoscopy--dissemination of cancer is found in peritoneum. Today's views regarding treatment of not advanced cancer considerable are based on experience when the traditional operations were used to remove gallbladder. Further more--it permitted to accept that just cholecystectomy is sufficient in cases when cancer infiltration has not gone beyond mucous membrane. In cases of more advanced cancer extensive operations may prolong life. Due to that observation in cases of gallbladder with cancer infiltration beyond mucous membrane and removed in laparoscopic way an extensive operation is carried out later and it is taking in adherent liver parenchyma and lymphatic tissue in hepato-duodenal ligament or if necessary main biliary tract. Extensive operations are being carried out till microscopic routine test has been performed and few days after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Some other solution rely during laparoscopic operation--on treating respective with thicken wall gallbladder as a suspected of cancer and microscopic test is carried out intraoperatively. It conditions accomplishment of extensive operation. It must be emphasise that laparoscopic technique encourages dissemination of cancer. From different point of view switching from laparoscopic to traditional cholecystectomy with 1% risk of cancer in thicken wall gallbladder against remaining will be deprived of benefits of laparoscopic operation. Still this quite complicated problem remains open to discussions, research and it needs some time yet before solution will be found."
CD009323,0,11142138,0,[Gastroenterology diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma].,"Abdominal ultrasound is the primary imaging study for patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma. Unless the tumor is large, this test might not be abnormal. The next appropriate test in the diagnostic work-up is the EUS. If this technique is not available, dual-phase spiral CT might be ordered instead. In cases which remain unclear or require palliative relief of biliary obstruction. It has been proposed that diagnosis and staging of a pancreatic carcinoma can be afforded by an all-in-one investigation using MRI, MRCP and MR-angiography. But at present, the superiority of MRI for diagnosing pancreatic cancer is insufficiently established. Conventional angiography does no longer play a role in the staging process. Fine-needle aspiration of focal pancreatic lesions is only recommended in patients who have unresectable lesions or who are more likely to have a focal inflammatory lesion in chronic pancreatitis. Laparoscopy is indicated if there is a high likelihood of unrecognized peritoneal or hepatic micrometastases in patients who are otherwise candidates for a surgical cure. Furthermore, laparoscopy should only be performed if the proof of metastases precludes further surgery or if palliative surgery is not necessary. Tumor markers and genetic markers might help to detect pancreatic cancer. However, the optimal screening method for the diagnosis of early and potentially curable pancreatic cancer is not in sight as yet."

The objective of the present study was to assess tumour growth and immune patterns after laparoscopy on an experimental study. Lewis rats, bearing an intrapancreatic ductal carcinoma randomly underwent one of the following 2-hour procedures: anaesthesia, laparotomy or CO(2) pneumoperitoneum. Cell-mediated immunity was investigated through determination of serum IL1beta concentrations by ELISA and TNFalpha, IL6 and iNOS gene transcriptions in blood white cells and peritoneal cells by RT-PCR 1 day after operation. Tumour growth and spread patterns were assessed on anatomopathological examination 2 weeks after surgery. Tumour growth and spread were unaffected no matter what procedure was applied, but port-site seeding occurred in half of the cases undergoing laparoscopy. No significant change in acute-phase protein response, represented by IL1beta serum concentration, was found after laparoscopy. TNFalpha, IL6 and inducible NO synthase gene transcriptions were enhanced in blood white cells and depressed in peritoneal immune cells after laparoscopy. In our experimental conditions, cell-mediated immune response to CO(2) pneumoperitoneum seems to be a good systemic immune activation and a less acute peritoneal immune response as opposed to control laparoscopy. This early impairment of peritoneal macrophage immune activity, observed after a long-lasting CO(2) pneumoperitoneum, might be responsible for the high rate of port site recurrence."

Combined procedure or concurrent procedure?].,"Bile duct stones, benign lesions of the bile duct, and malignant stenoses are principal entities requiring an interdisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment. There are unequivocal indications for surgical and interventional approaches. In many situations sparse data do not allow for clear-cut recommendations, which leads to a competition of surgical and interventional modes of treatment. In cholecystocholedocholithiasis, therapeutic splitting--endoscopic stone extraction and laparoscopic cholecystectomy--is at present the preferred strategy. The laparoscopic approach, including common bile duct exploration, may prove advantageous in the future. Emergency situations caused by choledocholithiasis--purulent cholangitis and biliary pancreatitis--require interventional treatment. For bile duct injuries with biliary leakage and treatment of short strictures, transpapillary or transhepatic prostheses may be adequate. In extended strictures or bile duct defects, surgical repair is required. In malignant stenoses, surgical treatment provides the longest survival.

There are however advantages of ERCP especially if the option of a therapeutic procedure, e.g., extraction of stones or placing of stents is considered. Besides ERCP prior laparoscopic cholecystectomy which is discussed elsewhere in this journal, indications for preoperative ERCP consist in patients after concussion trauma and hyperamylasemia as long as CT or MRI are not able to show pancreatic duct rupture. In this context the possibility of a stent placement is a major advantage of ERCP, since surgery may be avoided by this procedure. Preoperative ERCP may be performed in patients with chronic pancreatitis and refractory pain with the option of endoscopic therapy in cases with limited findings (less than 3 stones located in the pancreatic head). Furthermore, ERCP plays an important role in the preoperative differentiation between cystic neoplasms and pancreatic pseudocysts. Pseudocysts may be cured by endoscopical placement of transpapillary, transgastric or transduodenal stents. But so far no prospective studies have compared surgical with endoscopical drainage of pseudocysts. Finally, ERCP in the primary diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma plays only a limited role and should be performed only if non-invasive methods are not able to clarify the situation."
CD009323,0,11077483,0,[Does every patient with pancreatic disease need ultrasound examination?].,"The following paper discusses the indications for ultrasound examinations in pancreatic diseases. Transcutaneous, intraoperative, endoscopic, laparoscopic and interventional ultrasound techniques are reviewed in the context of acute and chronic pancreatitis, as well as pancreatic cancer and endocrine tumors of the pancreas. In acute pancreatitis the results of sonography are inferior to CT-scanning, which is still the examination of choice in cases with a necrotising course. In chronic pancreatitis ultrasound can be helpful in localising and draining pseudocysts. Intraoperatively the bile duct and pancreatic duct can be localised easily. In pancreatic cancer laparoscopic sonography as part of diagnostic laparoscopy reduces the number of negative laparotomies for irresectable cancer. Intraoperative ultrasound is mandatory during operations for endocrine tumors of the pancreas."
CD009323,0,11077332,0,Staging laparoscopy promotes increased utilization of postoperative therapy for unresectable intra-abdominal malignancies.,"Staging laparoscopy avoids unnecessary laparotomies in patients with unresectable intra-abdominal malignancies. However, the postoperative oncologic treatment of these patients has not been documented. This study compares rates and timing of postoperative chemotherapy (ChT) and/or radiation therapy (XRT) in patients with unresectable intra-abdominal malignancies initially evaluated by staging laparoscopy (SL) or exploratory laparotomy (EL). The records of patients surgically evaluated for esophageal, gastric, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic cancers or abdominal lymphoma were retrospectively reviewed. Data gathered included type of exploration (SL or EL), resectability, whether postoperative cancer treatment was given (ChT, XRT, or both), and the time from surgery to the beginning of such treatment. This study includes only patients with unresectable malignancies. Twenty-one patients underwent SL and 58 EL. Sixteen of the SL patients (76%) and 25 of the EL patients (43%) received postoperative cancer treatment (P = 0.009). The median number of days from surgery to postoperative cancer treatment was 13 days (range 5 to 41 days) for the SL group and 35 days (range 16 to 89 days) for the EL group (P = 0.0004). We conclude that patients with unresectable intra-abdominal malignancies discovered by SL are more likely to receive postoperative ChT and/or XRT than patients surgically evaluated by EL. Further studies to determine whether this better utilization of postoperative treatment results in better outcomes in these patients are needed."
CD009323,0,11075985,0,Acute pancreatitis secondary to pancreatic carcinoma. Study Group Participants.,"Acute pancreatitis (AP) has been recognized as a presentation of patients with pancreatic carcinoma (PC). However, the natural history of patients with PC who present with AP as the first manifestation is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the time between the presentation of AP and diagnosis of PC and what factors should alert the clinician to suspect underlying PC in patients with AP. Nineteen physicians completed the survey forms that encompassed 45 patients with a diagnosis of AP preceding a diagnosis of PC. Information included the patient's age, gender, race, conditions that could account for the AP, criteria for diagnosis of AP, severity of AP, criteria for diagnosis of PC, time between the diagnosis of AP and PC, pathology of the carcinoma, extension of the disease, treatment of PC, and survival after the diagnosis of PC. The study population consisted of 45 patients, 27 (60%) men and 18 (40%) women whose average age was 58 years (range, 32-89). Thirty-eight patients were Caucasian, five were black, one was Japanese, and one Arabian. The number of AP episodes before PC diagnosis ranged between one and 15 (mean + 2 SD). AP was mild in 40 (89%) and severe in five (11%). The time between the onset of AP and the diagnosis of PC averaged 34 weeks (range, 1-52). Symptoms on presentation of AP included abdominal pain 45 (100%), weight loss 15 (33%), and jaundice 3 (7%). CA 19-9 was available in 13 patients, eight of whom had levels >100 at the time AP was diagnosed. Abnormal imaging suggestive of PC was detected by ultrasonography in 17 patients, by computed tomography in 30, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in 20, and endoscopic ultrasonography in three. Tissue diagnosis was obtained in 43 of 45 (96%) patients; by surgery in 25 patients, needle aspiration in 14, laparoscopy in one, autopsy in two, and lymph node in one. Pathology revealed adenocarcinoma in 37 patients, squamous cell carcinoma in two, undifferentiated carcinoma in two, islet cell in one, and cystadenocarcinoma in one. Surgical findings in 26 patients included 19 with a nonresectable lesion or metastasis and seven patients with resectable lesion for cure. Thirteen patients (28%) were alive 1 year after the diagnosis of PC. The patients had a mean of two (range, one to 15) episodes of AP before the diagnosis of PC, and this was associated with a delay of 34 weeks from AP to diagnosis of PC. Patients with PC who presented with AP were generally older than 50 years of age and the severity of the pancreatitis was mild. The survival rate of patients with PC who presented initially with AP was >25% at 1 year compared with 20% 1 year overall survival of patients with PC. AP seems to be an early presentation of PC and should be sought in patients with idiopathic pancreatitis."

These major complications were successfully managed by percutaneous methods in 8 of 16 patients while antihelmintic therapy was sufficient in two patients with a small recurrent cyst and ERCP was used in one patient to relieve biliary obstruction. Surgery was required in two patients only. With a success rate of 87.5%, the nonsurgical approach is the preferred method for treating a post-surgical complication."
CD009323,0,11059712,0,Laparoscopic approach to adrenal and endocrine pancreatic tumors.,"Laparoscopic adrenalectomy quickly has become the procedure of choice for benign adrenal lesions because it results in less pain, shorter hospital stay, comparable safety, and more patient satisfaction overall. The laparoscopic approach requires advanced laparoscopic surgical skills. Surgeons should be familiar with these techniques and the open approaches before attempting this procedure. When first learning the technique, small left-sided lesions are likely the easiest, and a more experienced surgeon should be present for the initial few cases; however, at this point, the laparoscopic approach to pancreatic endocrine tumors does not have a clear benefit, and it should be considered primarily investigational without clearly established benefits."

Ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging all demonstrated a homogeneous cyst, 9 x 4 cm in size, at the tail of the pancreas without mural nodules or septa. Because an intestinal structure was identified between the cyst and stomach preoperatively by computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasonography, laparoscopic cystogastrostomy was carried out instead of percutaneous or endoscopic cyst drainage. The cyst was exposed by dissecting the lesser omentum and found to have no adhesion to the surrounding tissues. Anastomosis was performed using an endoscopic linear stapler via small cystotomy and gastrotomy openings on the lesser curvature, which were then sutured laparoscopically. The postoperative course was uneventful. Laparoscopic surgery is recommended as a safe, reliable, and minimally invasive treatment for managing pancreatic pseudocyst."

CD009323,0,11030641,0,Laparoscopic procedures.,"Laparoscopic procedures are increasingly used in clinical surgery because of significantly faster convalescence than occurs with open surgery. These advances have been facilitated not least by modern gastroenterological procedures and the co-operation between surgeons and gastroenterologists. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most evident example of such surgery. The widespread use of this minimally invasive approach was essentially made possible by the availability of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) and ERT, since the laparoscopic removal of bile duct stones is still difficult and not always reliable. Further instances of so-called 'therapeutic splitting' are palliative procedures and the combined endoscopic/endoluminal and laparoscopic/intracavitary approach in cases of early cancer. Additionally, laparoscopic procedures are described that might be a surgical alternative to medical treatment (e.g. fundoplication and cardiomyotomy)."
CD009323,0,11026192,0,[Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in choledocholithiasis and stricture of the terminal part of the common bile duct].,"The authors offer the treatment and diagnostic algorithm in choledocholithiasis, stricture of a terminal portion of the common hepatic duct and papilla stenosis revealed in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCE). With the purpose of intraoperative assessment of bile ducts states during LCE, the diagnostic system including laparoscopic and ultrasonic examinations, cholangiography and choledochoscopy was developed and applied. In intraoperative revealing of choledocholithiasis without bile outflow disorders and wide cystic duct the authors prefer to remove the concrements during choledochoscopy through cystic duct without intervention on Vater's papilla (VP). In combination of choledocholithiasis with bile outflow disorders and also in isolated papilla stenosis and stricture of a terminal portion of the common hepatic duct, one-stage laparoscopic cholecystectomy, intraoperative antegrade papillosphincterotomy and retrograde calculus extraction is optimal. In cases when complete endoscopic calculus extraction is impossible, the drainage of the common hepatic duct by Cholsted's with subsequent delayed endoscopic papillosphincterotomy (EPST) is acceptable. During intraoperative examination in 49 patients (57.6%) the concrements in choledochus, not diagnosed earlier, were revealed, in 21--stricture of terminal choledochus portion and in 19 patients--papilla stenosis. In 12 cases the concrements were removed during choledochoscopy through the cystic duct stump, 4 patients with big concrements required laparoscopic choledocholithotomy. In 16 cases LCE with various variants of choledochus drainage was performed as the first stage, as the second stage--EPST and lithoextraction. Antegrade papillosphincterotomy was performed in 15 patients during LCE. In 12 cases intraoperatively revealed choledocholithiasis combined with papilla stenosis (7) and choledochus stricture (5) was the indications to intraoperative papillosphincterotomy. Papilla stenosis was the indication to antegrade papillosphincterotomy in 3 patients."

CD009323,0,11016462,0,Radical surgery for gallbladder cancer: current options.,"Gallbladder carcinoma is the most common malignancy of the biliary tract. There are still many controversies regarding the type of curative surgical treatment for each stage of the disease. The staging system used is the TNM classification of the International Union Against Cancer. Different patterns of spread characterize gallbladder cancer but the two main types are direct invasion and lymph node metastases; since only the depth of invasion can be easily recognized by imaging techniques, it becomes the main variable in choosing the appropriate surgical treatment. Most Tis and T1 tumours are incidentally discovered after cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis and no further therapy is requested; for pT1b tumours, relaparotomy with hepatic resection and N1 dissection is associated with a better survival. For T2 tumours, cholecystectomy with hepatic resection and dissection of N1-2 lymph nodes is the standard treatment, with a 5-year survival of 60-80%. The only chance of long-term survival for patients with a T3-T4 tumour is an extended operation combining an hepatic resection with an N1-2 dissection with or without excision of the common bile duct. A subset of patients with peripancreatic positive nodes or invasion of adjacent organs seems to benefit from a synchronous pancreaticoduodenectomy."

CD009323,0,10993424,0,Current surgical therapy for carcinoma of the pancreas.,"Despite progress in treating many solid tumors, pancreatic cancer continues to be a grave illness. Each year, >29,000 new cases of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas are diagnosed in the United States. Of these patients, only 10-20% have resectable tumors and 25,000 patients (83%) die within 12 months of diagnosis. Until recently, surgery has been the only ""effective"" therapy available for select patients. Historically, the operative mortality after radical pancreatic resection has been variable, ranging 1-30%, and is both operator- and institution-dependent. Even with a safe and complete surgical resection, the actual 5-year survival after surgery alone is essentially zero, although rates up to 5% have been reported. Despite what would appear to be a dismal outlook, slow progress has occurred in the operative and postoperative care of patients with pancreatic cancer. Advanced imaging techniques and laparoscopy have limited the number of unnecessary laparotomies, and novel adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy approaches have yielded promising results. This review will summarize the recent literature concerning the surgical therapy and trends in the treatment of carcinoma of the pancreas from 1990 to 1999."

CD009323,0,10987027,0,Role of laparoscopy in the staging of malignant disease.,"Although diagnostic laparoscopy has been used by surgeons and gastroenterologists since the early 1900s, today's surgical oncologists have been relatively slow to embrace this technology. Together with the fervor and benefits afforded by laparoscopic therapeutic interventions in the management of patients with benign disease and the diagnostic usefulness in blunt trauma and abdominal pain, awareness has been rekindled regarding the advantages of laparoscopy for the staging of abdominal malignancy. As surgeons begin to realize that extirpative procedures are doomed to failure in curing patients with diffuse abdominal metastases disclosed on laparoscopic assessment, palliative measures, such as stent placement, ablative procedures, balloon dilatation, intraluminal high-dose radiation, and laser techniques will be used commonly by surgical endoscopists and gastroenterologists. Similarly, it is hoped that the use of systemic chemotherapy will achieve better specificity in cell destruction in patients identified laparoscopically to have uncontained disease in the abdominal cavity. The sensitivity of sonography combined with laparoscopy has been shown to approach that of celiotomy in the evaluation of solid organs, thereby avoiding unnecessary laparotomy and its associated morbidities. Using sonography as a complement to laparoscopy will extend the usefulness of both techniques. The application of laparoscopy and the advent of miniaturized laparoscopic instrumentation (Fig. 7), both diagnostic and therapeutic, in the management of patients with abdominal malignancy will be limited only by the creativity and expertise of physicians and instrument makers."
CD009323,0,10982593,0,Ultrasonically activated scalpel is an effective tool for cutting the pancreas in biliary-pancreatic surgery: experimental and clinical studies.,"The ultrasonically activated scalpel, a new tool for cutting and coagulating tissue, uses high-frequency ultrasonic vibrations, and has been widely employed in the field of laparoscopic surgery. We evaluated its usefulness for cutting the pancreas in biliary-pancreatic surgery. We planned experimental and clinical studies using an ultrasonically activated scalpel (harmonic scalpel) for cutting the pancreas. The harmonic scalpel was set up at a power level of 3 (75% of full power) in the knife mode. In the experimental study, using dogs, cutting of the pancreas with the harmonic scalpel resulted in significantly less bleeding and significantly less histological tissue damage to the cut stumps than cutting of the pancreas with an electric or a regular scalpel. In the clinical study: (1) the hemostatic effect of the harmonic scalpel was excellent or good in any condition of the pancreas; (2) of 50 stumps of the main pancreatic duct cut with the harmonic scalpel, the stump was easily found in 48 (96%), while ultrasonography was necessary to find the remaining 2 stumps in soft pancreas; (3) in 41 anastomoses (29 soft and 12 hard pancreas) there were no postoperative pancreatic fistulae. These results indicate that the ultrasonically activated scalpel is an effective tool for cutting the pancreas in biliary-pancreatic surgery."
CD009323,0,10982588,0,Laparoscopic pancreatic cystgastrostomy.,"Internal drainage of acute pancreatic pseudocysts is indicated 6 weeks after the first documentation of pseudocyst. It is also indicated for symptomatic chronic pseudocysts 6 cm or more in diameter. When pseudocysts are located in close contact with the posterior wall of the stomach, they are best drained by pseudocyst-gastrostomy. This procedure can also be completed making use of intragastric surgical techniques. Under standard laparoscopic observation, three intragastric ports are placed through the abdominal and anterior gastric walls, establishing working channels for a telescope and hand instruments. After the presence of pseudocysts is confirmed, the posterior wall of the stomach and the cyst wall can be incised by electrocautery. After a sufficient drainage orifice is made and the cyst contents are thoroughly debrided, the intragastric ports are removed and defects in the gastric wall are closed with sutures placed via the standard laparoscopic approach. This approach is much less invasive than the conventional approach, which entails a large gastrotomy in the anterior wall of the stomach. This procedure should be the method of choice when interventional radiology or endoscopic intervention fails to effectively drain retrogastric pseudocysts."

Laparoscopic ultrasound, dissection, and/or peritoneal cytology may be used to enhance the sensitivity of the staging procedure. Our experience at Massachusetts General Hospital with staging laparoscopy and peritoneal cytology over the past 8 years (N = 239) reveals that approximately 30% of patients without metastases by computed tomography harbor occult metastatic disease at laparoscopy. Additionally, published series demonstrate accurate determination of resectability in greater than 75% of patients after staging laparoscopy. Staging laparoscopy in patients with pancreatic cancer allows optimization of resources and avoidance of unnecessary surgery."
CD009323,0,10982585,0,Laparoscopic management of common bile duct stones.,"We reviewed our experience with the management of common bile duct (CBD) stones in 100 consecutive patients treated laparoscopically during the past 9 years (1990-1998) and evaluated the advantages, disadvantages, and feasibility of the treatment, to elucidate reasonable therapeutic strategies for patients harboring CBD stones. We conclude that the most rational management of CBD stones is that which is decided according to the size of the CBD, which, in turn, depends on the size, number, and location of stones. The cystic duct in patients with a non-dilated CBD is narrow, because the size of the CBD depends on the size and number of stones that have migrated through the narrow cystic duct, and the stones in the non-dilated CBD are therefore usually small in size and number. Patients with a dilated CBD, however, are good candidates to undergo single-stage laparoscopic treatment. In our Department, therefore, even if complete removal of stones has failed in patients with non-dilated CBD, further choledochotomy is not carried out, and a C-tube is placed through the cystic duct for a subsequent postoperative transduodenal approach, because laparoscopic transcystic CBD exploration and choledochotomy may not be always feasible in those patients with non-dilated CBD, and spontaneous migration of small stones into the duodenum is frequently noted. In fact, some stones demonstrated on intraoperative cholangiograms were not revealed by postoperative cholangiography. In contrast, retained stones detected postoperatively were successfully removed by postoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST), the endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation technique (EPBDT), or postoperative cholangioscopy (POCS) without any injury to the sphincter of Oddi. With this approach, we believe that the causes of stone recurrence can be avoided in the majority of cases."
CD009323,0,10982584,0,Possibilities of laparoscopic liver resection.,"The aim of this study was to report the results of our experience in liver surgery by laparoscopy. From 1989 to 1996, 30 patients (20 women, 10 men; age, 23-88 years; mean age, 53.9 years) underwent laparoscopic liver surgery at our Institute for the following pathology: 10 for biliary cysts, 7 for polycystic diseases, 8 for benign tumors, 3 for hydatid cysts, 1 for chronic abscess, and 1 for metastasis. The locations of these lesions were: 19 in the left lobe, 4 in the right lobe, and 7 in both lobes. Their average size was 8. 45 cm (range, 2.5-22 cm). The largest lesions were biliary cysts; among benign tumors, the maximum diameter was 8 cm. Surgical treatment was as follows: 17 deroofings, 3 pericystectomies, 7 tumorectomies, and 3 left lobectomies. The mean operative time was 79 min (range, 45-527 min). Three of the 30 laparoscopic procedures (10%) were converted to open surgery, because of bleeding in 2 patients with polycystic disease and because it was impossible to carry out the dissection in 1 patient with liver-cell adenoma adjacent to the left portal branch. There were no deaths in this series and 6 patients showed morbidity: 2 patients with polycystic disease developed ascites and required intensive care unit recovery, 1 patient had phlebitis, 1 had infection of the urinary tract, and 2 had local septic complications. Preliminary findings show that the laparoscopic approach to liver lesions may represent safe and effective treatment in selected patients, on condition that several technical details are respected. Of fundamental importance are the surgical equipment, the presence of two experienced operators to do four-hands surgery, and the careful selection of indications, reserving laparoscopic treatment only for those lesions located in easily accessible areas, mainly in the lateral and anterior hepatic segments."

CD009323,0,10980938,0,Biliary tract imaging.,"In addition to the detection of gallstones, common bile duct stones, and narrowed and dilated bile ducts, recent advancements in imaging techniques now make it possible to diagnose microlithiasis, pathology of normal-size ducts, and dysfunction of the gallbladder and the sphincter of Oddi (SO). More and more frequently, noninvasive imaging techniques obviate the risk of invasive investigation. These techniques can also take the place of unsuccessful or contraindicated direct cholangiography, and they play an essential role in treatment planning and diagnosis of postoperative complications. Transabdominal ultrasonography (TUS) remains fundamental for initial assessment of the biliary tract. Technical developments make magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography the most promising diagnostic technique of the biliary tract. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is most helpful for detection of microlithiasis and evaluation of the ampullary region, the periductal structures, and the regional lymph nodes in neoplastic diseases. Cholescintigraphy is most valuable to assess bile dynamics in the diagnosis of gallbladder and SO dysfunction and in postoperative bile leakage."

Laparascopic cholecystectomy has been safely performed as a day-case procedure and has lowered the morbidity of cholecystectomy in the setting of acute cholecystitis. Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration allows cholecystectomy and the removal of common bile duct stones to be performed during the same procedure, thereby decreasing hospital stay. Several new noninvasive modalities have been recently developed to image the biliary tract. In addition, laparoscopic ultrasound has led to rapid intraoperative imaging of the extrahepatic biliary tree. The long-term results of laparoscopic bile duct injuries have been better defined during the past several years. Finally, the role of surgical resection for gallbladder cancer detected during or after laparoscopic cholecystectomy has recently been evaluated."

The most probable complications are abscess, intestinal obstruction, abdominal wall infection, intraperitoneal leakage, enterocutaneous fistula, and loss, elbowing, or even rupture of the enteral probe. The authors report the case of a patient with severe malnutrition concomitant with advanced gastric cancer who underwent jejunostomy because of an incapacity for normal oral feeding. Previous attempts to pass a nasal enteral probe were not successful, even with the aid of endoscopy. Videolaparoscopy was indicated for adequate staging of the neoplasm and for performance of video-assisted jejunostomy. During the procedure, an extensive carcinomatous process was observed that rendered comprehension of the abdominal anatomy extremely difficult. Consequently, while attempting jejunal catheterization, unintentional catheterization of the terminal ileum took place. The authors discuss this first reported case of unintentional ileostomy and review the literature."
CD009323,0,10961744,0,The prevention of bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy from the point of view of anatomic variation.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate ways to prevent bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with anomalous biliary tract anatomy. The biliary tract was studied using cholangiograms of 511 patients who had gallbladder disease and was dissected in 92 cadaveric specimens. The authors classified confluent forms of the cystic duct and the bile duct into five different types, including four anomalous types. Sixteen instances (3.13%) of anatomic variation of the biliary tract were found among the patients, and four cases (4.35%) were found in the cadavers. Among the 511 patients, there were 495 cases of type C anatomy, three cases of type A, seven cases of type R, six cases of type P, and zero cases of type L; among the 92 cadaveric specimens, there were 88 cases of type C anatomy, one case of type R, two cases of type P, and one case of type L. For anatomic types A, P, and R, there is a high probability of risk of cutting the wrong duct. Therefore, it is important to clarify the anatomy of the biliary tract by preoperative examination and to carefully dissect the cystic duct close to the neck of the gallbladder during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Anatomic variation of the biliary tract is common and can create a rare pitfall during laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,10959381,0,[Evaluation of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound in diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic lesions].,"Pancreatic lesions present a diagnostic challenge. Even modern imaging techniques are not sensitive enough in determining resectability of pancreatic tumors. A substantial proportion of patients therefore undergo unnecessary surgical exploration. We determined the impact of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound (LAPUS) examinations on surgical decision-making in 60 patients with pancreatic lesions. Of 48 with solid pancreatic lesions, 22 were defined by LAPUS as having nonresectable tumors, while conventional imaging studies defined only 9 of them as such. 3 of these 9 underwent successful resections of the pancreatic mass. Surgical intervention was ruled out by LAPUS in 16 patients (33.3%) but 26 had resectable lesions of whom 25 underwent surgery. 3 of this group were found to have nonresectable tumors at surgery, a false-positive rate of 6.2%. Overall sensitivity of LAPUS in our series was 88%. In 12 patients with cystic pancreatic lesions LAPUS contributed significantly to the preoperative decision due to clear imaging of the cystic lesion. Additional information was obtained from ultrasound guided-biopsy of the cyst wall, as well as determination of tumor-marker levels in the cystic fluid aspirate. LAPUS contributed significantly to operative management in 58%."

CD009323,0,10931589,0,MRI with mangafodipir trisodium in the detection and staging of pancreatic cancer.,"The purpose of this study was to compare prospectively computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging before and after mangafodipir trisodium infusion for the detection and staging of focal pancreatic lesions. From November 1996 to October 1997, 43 consecutive patients suspected to have a focal pancreatic lesion were included in a phase III study. Triphasic helical CT was performed, as well as MRI at 1.5 T, as follows: axial T1-weighted (T1w) turbo spin echo (TSE), spectral presaturation with inversion recovery (SPIR) T1w TSE, T1w turbo field echo (TFE), and SPIR T2w TSE before and after mangafodipir trisodium (0.01 mmol/ml, 0.5 ml/kg) infusion. Imaging results were correlated with surgery, laparoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasound, and biopsy. Objective measurements were performed by measuring signal intensities (SIs) of lesion and parenchyma and calculating contrast indexes (CIs) and contrast-to-noise-ratios (CNRs) to assess the delineation of the tumor. SIs were correlated with four phantom standards with a known SI. Thirty-eight pancreatic adenocarcinomas were present, as well as one cystadenoma, two papillomas, and two cases of focal pancreatitis. SI measurements revealed significant increases in CIs for the lesion compared with the parenchyma in T1w TSE (69.7 vs 152.7; P = 0. 0003) and T1w TFE (107.8 vs 194.2; P = 0.0002). These series also revealed significant increases in CNRs (for T1w TSE: 9.7 vs 13.0; P = 0.0407 and for T1w TFE: 14.5 vs 26.1; P = 0.0001). In the other series, there was no significant increase. CT detected 38 lesions, MRI without mangafodipir trisodium detected 39 lesions, and MRI with mangafodipir trisodium detected 40 lesions, giving detection accuracy rates of 88%, 91%, and 93%, respectively. Staging accuracy rates for vascular ingrowth were 81%, 75%, and 81%, respectively. Overall staging accuracy rates were 57%, 54%, and 54%, respectively, mostly due to undetected small metastases in the peritoneum, omentum, or liver (< 1 cm). This study indicates that a) MRI after mangafodipir trisodium gives a better delineation of the tumor in T1w series, but b) does not significantly improve the detection rate and staging accuracy of focal pancreatic lesions over MRI without this contrast medium."

The authors report a case of a 4-year-old girl whom on routine abdominal ultrasound as follow-up for vesicoureteral reflux was found to have a choledochal cyst. Follow-up hepatobiliary scan together with the ultrasound findings was consistent with a rare type II choledochal cyst. On laparoscopy, a type II choledochal cyst was confirmed on dissection and amenable to laparoscopic excision. Intraoperative cholangiogram after excision showed normal remaining biliary anatomy. The patient was discharged the following day without delayed complications on follow-up visits. This report suggests a role for laparoscopic surgery in the definitive management of selected cases of choledochal cystic disease.

CD009323,0,10917115,0,The importance of intraoperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) using an electrosurgery energy source was successfully performed in 59 (95%) out of 62 selected patients. The procedures were performed by different surgical teams at Trakya University, Medical Fakulty, in the department of General Surgery and the Karl-Franzens-University School of Medicine, in the department of General Surgery. Cholangiography was routine at Karl Franzens University and selective at Trakya University. Laparoscopic intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) was performed in 48 (81.3%) patients, and open IOC was performed in 3 patients. Two patients had common duct stones; one of which was unsuspected preoperatively. These cases underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic papillotomy (EP). One patient had a choledocal tumor, unsuspected preoperatively. Anatomical anomalies were not identified. Cholangiography could not be performed in one case in which there was no suspected pathology. ERCP was performed on one patient 30 days after being discharged because of acute cholangitis. In this case, residual stones were identified in the choledocus. Four patients underwent open cholecystectomy because of tumor, unidentified cystic duct or common bile duct pathology that could not be visualized on the cholangiogram. Our study suggests that cholangiography performed via the cystic duct before any structures are divided can prevent the most serious complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy--common duct injury. We recommend that cholangiography be attempted on all patients undergoing LC."

CD009323,0,10913380,0,Current status and future perspectives in gastric cancer management.,"Gastric cancer is still a major health problem and a leading cause of cancer mortality despite a worldwide decline in incidence. Environmental and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) acting early in life in a multistep and multifactorial process may cause intestinal type carcinomas, whereas genetic abnormalities are related more to the diffuse type of disease. Primarily due to early detection of the disease, the results of treatment for gastric cancer have improved in Japan, Korea and several specialized Western centres. Surgery offers excellent long-term survival results for early gastric cancer (EGC). Advances in diagnostic and treatment technology have contributed to a trend towards minimal invasive surgery such as endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and laparoscopic surgery for selected mucosal cancers. In the Western world, however, more than 80% of patients at diagnosis have an advanced gastric cancer with a poor prognosis. The aim of surgery is complete removal of the tumour (UICC R0-resection), which is known to be the only proven, effective treatment modality and the most important treatment-related prognostic factor. Gastrectomy with preservation of the spleen and pancreas in most cases is the standard procedure. However, at present there is no consensus about the optimal extent of lymph-node dissection. The hypothesis that extended (D2) lymph-node dissection leads to improved survival has not been confirmed in randomized trials. Results from specialized centres and ongoing multi-institutional randomized trials, however, indicate that D2 dissection, with preservation of the spleen and pancreas, can be performed with the same safety as a D1 dissection. Furthermore, in 50% of patients with node-positive disease, the extraperigastric N2 nodes are involved (N2 disease) and thus an R0-resection is achievable only by a D2 node dissection resulting in a 5-year survival of about 30% for such patients. However, even after a D2 node dissection with curative potential, disease recurs in two-thirds of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) and is rapidly fatal. The need for an adjuvant treatment is obvious, but at present there is no such treatment of proven effectiveness. Promising results with preoperative chemotherapy, which increases the R0-resection rate, and intra-or early postoperative intraperitoneal chemohyperthermia to prevent peritoneal dissemination have been reported. However, randomized trials are necessary before these combined treatments become widely accepted. Present data indicate that the treatment of gastric cancer has become more and more sophisticated with a tailored therapy for individual cases. Treatment includes a broad spectrum of therapeutic options from EMR for selected mucosal cancers to aggressive combined treatment for LAGC. Precise knowledge of patterns of recurrence and metastases, critical evaluation of clinicopathologic variables, integration of high technology into diagnosis to predict accurately pre-treatment staging, and the surgeon's ability to perform minimally invasive surgery and D2 node dissection technique are necessary for an appropriate treatment option. All these prerequisites are best ensured by management in experienced surgical oncology units."
CD009323,0,10883995,0,Simple laparoscopic ultrasound technique for prevention of bile duct injuries.,Bile duct injuries are serious complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

We have found a simple LUS scanning technique that can be useful for preventing bile duct injuries.
CD009323,0,10883205,0,[Laparoscopic surgery in treating hepatic cysts].,"Solitary and multiple hepatic cysts are now more commonly found because of advances in imaging techniques. Most hepatic cysts are asymptomatic, but when they do cause symptoms they require surgical intervention. The advent of laparoscopy and of laparoscopic ultrasonography allow comprehensive evaluation and treatment of the cysts. 12 patients with hepatic cysts were treated laparoscopically. 8 with single cysts underwent successful subtotal cyst resection without signs of recurrence (up to 20 years of follow-up). 4 with polycystic liver disease underwent sub-total resection of superficial cysts. Deep cysts were unroofed and drained under laparoscopic ultrasound guidance. In this group, 1 experienced recurrence of symptoms and required partial hepatectomy of the involved segment. In another, a connection between a deep cyst and bile ducts was demonstrated and cystojejunostomy was performed. The laparoscopic approach in the management of patients with liver cysts is effective and safe, and we recommend it as the procedure of choice for single hepatic cysts. In polycystic liver disease the procedure is much less successful."
CD009323,0,10878881,0,[The diagnostic approach in hepatic lesions--the role and place of laparoscopy with laparoscopic echography].,"The study is designed to cases the potentials of laparoscopy with laparoscopic echography, and the role they play in the diagnostic algorithm, with the purpose to develop an optimal therapeutic approach to hepatic lesions. Laparoscope R. Wolf and 7.5 MHz linear transducer, obtained from the Aloka Company are employed in work. A total of 303 patients presenting primary and metastatic carcinoma of liver (58 and 145, respectively), cholangiocarcinoma (11), hemangioma(28), adenomatous hyperplasia (38) and other lesions (23) are studied. Morphologic verification of the diagnosis is done in over one third of cases. In 30 to 40 per cent of the series reviewed laparoscopic echography supplements the laparoscopic finding depending on the type of lesion. Without pretending to create a diagnostic algorithm in individual hepatic lesions, abiding to the following diagnostic approach is strongly recommended: stage one--echography (a noninvasive, not irradiating, cheap, readily accessible and often resolving method), stage two--noninvasive, stage three--invasive, stage four--preoperative or final (laparoscopy plus laparoscopic echography). In the event of properly established indications, the invasive methods of study (thin-needle biopsy under ultrasonographic control plus laparoscopy) may be considered as a second stage, without any need to apply the complete spectrum of examination accessible. Not infrequently, laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasonography play a crucial role in diagnosing liver lesions, exact determination of the stage and resectability of the neoplastic process, planning and shortening the duration of operation with simultaneous identification of intractable patients."

CD009323,0,10872981,0,Alternative technique of laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy for advanced pancreatic head cancer.,"Only 20% of patients with pancreatic cancer can undergo curative resection. Therefore, palliative treatment of pancreatic cancer assumes the utmost clinical importance. The aim of the palliative treatment of pancreatic head carcinoma is to relieve the jaundice and/or duodenal obstruction. Endoscopic or transparietal decompression of the obstructed bile duct can be accomplished in most cases, but the durability of these techniques is not as great as that of a surgically created bypass. On the other hand, hepaticojejunostomy carries higher morbidity and mortality rates than the former nonsurgical methods. In order to promote long lasting palliation with low morbidity and mortality rates, minimally invasive techniques of biliary and gastric bypass have been described. However, laparoscopic Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy seems to be a complex surgical procedure. With an aim to simplify the construction of a laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy, the authors suggest an alternative technique."
CD009323,0,10872980,0,Ultrasound-guided laparoscopic resection of pancreatic islet cell tumors.,"Pancreatic islet cell tumors represent a diverse group of neuroendocrine lesions. These tumors may be singular or multiple, benign or malignant, sporadic, or part of the constellation of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Tumors such as insulinomas and gastrinomas produce gastrointestinal peptides that lead to diagnosis. Nonfunctioning lesions may be found incidentally or by screening patients at high risk for such tumors. Successful management of patients with pancreatic islet cell tumors relies on accurate localization and sound operative technique. With proper preoperative localization, advanced laparoscopic methods can be used to manage patients with these pancreatic neoplasms. Preoperative localization of pancreatic islet cell tumors was difficult in the past. Standard imaging and localizing modalities, such as computed tomography scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, transabdominal sonography, and portal venous sampling, yield only 24% to 75% accuracy. Consequently, many biochemically suspected lesions cannot be imaged with current techniques. Decreased tactile sensation of laparoscopy adds complexity to intraoperative identification. Endoscopic sonography and laparoscopic sonography provide accurate preoperative and intraoperative localization to enhance laparoscopic and open resection. The authors treated two patients with islet cell neoplasms using endoscopic sonography to preoperatively visualize the tumors and laparoscopic sonography to guide laparoscopic enucleation. Their approach and difficulties are discussed."
CD009323,0,10872977,0,Variations of the cystic artery in Chinese adults.,"The origin and course of the cystic artery related to the Calot triangle were studied in 72 autopsies. The cystic artery arises from many possible origins; the right hepatic artery is the most common origin (76.6%). The Calot triangle (hepatocystic triangle), which is an important imaginary referent area for biliary surgery, is bounded by the common hepatic duct (CHD), the cystic duct, and the cystic artery. Of all the cystic arteries, 86.1% coursed through the Calot triangle, and 100% of the cystic arteries originating from the right hepatic artery coursed through the Calot triangle. However, only 54% of the cystic arteries that originated from the left, bifurcation, proper, and common hepatic arteries ran through the triangle. None of the cystic arteries that originated from the gastroduodenal, celiac, superior mesentery, or superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries passed through the triangle. Furthermore, 72.7% of the cystic arteries that originated from the right hepatic artery ran beneath the CHD as they entered the Calot triangle; the others ran anterior to the CHD. Of the cystic arteries that arose from locations other than the right hepatic artery, 29.4% ran posterior to the CHD, and 11.8% ran anterior to the CHD. The current study provides detailed information about anatomic variance in Chinese adults that may help avoid injury during open or laparoscopic cholecystectomies."
CD009323,0,10872521,0,Laparoscopic wedge resection of gastric submucosal tumors.,"Minimally invasive surgery has revolutionized the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors. Submucosal tumors (SMTs) of the stomach can be resected using laparoscopic techniques. Between 1993 and 1997, laparoscopic wedge resection was performed in 34 patients with an SMT of the stomach. The tumors ranged from 8 to 60 mm in diameter. All surgical margins were clear. The average operative time was 131 minutes. Most of the patients began eating on the first postoperative day and were discharged within 5 to 7 days. Histopathologic examination of the tumors showed gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n = 14), ectopic pancreas (n = 7), leiomyosarcoma (n = 4), schwannoma (n = 3), carcinoid (n = 2), leiomyoma (n = 2), an inflammatory lesion caused by parasites (n = 1), and cyst (n = 1).

CD009323,0,10871180,0,Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with preservation of the spleen.,"We describe a case of chronic pancreatitis treated by laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with conservation of the spleen involving the resection of the splenic vessels. A proximal ligation of the splenic artery and vein was performed, followed by transection of the body of the pancreas. Retroperitoneum was dissected to the left by mobilizing the stump of the transected pancreas. The entire distal pancreas was freed posteriorly. The distal splenic artery and vein were ligated and divided individually adjacent to the tail of the pancreas at the hilum of the spleen. The points of this operation were to ligate the splenic artery and vein at both sides of the resected pancreas and to save the spleen with the blood supply continuing through the short gastric vessels and the splenocolic ligament. This operation with splenic preservation is more suitable for a patient who is a candidate for laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, which will minimize the operation time, preserve the useful immunologic role of the spleen, and obtain the intact resected specimen. Furthermore, this procedure is useful in chronic pancreatitis patients because it avoids the difficult dissection of the posterior pancreas off of the splenic vessels."

Fifty consecutive human cadavers were dissected. A corrosion cast method was used. Six anastomotic branches (12%) of the cystic artery to the right or left hepatic artery ran underneath the gallbladder serosa surface and entered liver parenchyma after crossing the medial or lateral edge of the liver fossa without passing through the areolar tissue of the liver bed. Their mean length was 18.3 mm (range 4-60), and the mean diameter was 0.38 mm (range 0.2-0.8). Two cystic arteries that ascended in the midline between the gallbladder and liver bed were identified in 50 (4%) casts. Their lengths were 16 and 18 mm, and their diameters were 1.9 and 2.2 mm. Five and seven branches encircling the gallbladder arose radially. These two arterial branching patterns can cause arterial bleeding from the liver bed during and/or after laparoscopic cholecystectomy."

Herein we report the case of a 51-year-old male patient, who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy 2 years before presentation to our hospital. He had experienced tension sensation and epigastric pain since 4 months postoperatively. A well-defined epigastric mass, which was hard and painful on palpation, was detected and later confirmed by ultrasonography and CT scan. Explorative laparotomy revealed a mass in the area of the gastrocolic ligament,resulting from biliary gallstones in conjunction with a perimetral inflammatory reaction. A review of the literature showed that the incidence of gallbladder lesions during laparoscopy is 13-40%. In order to prevent this complication, meticulous isolation of the gallbladder, proper dissection of the cystic duct and artery, and careful extraction through the umbilical access are required. Ligation after the rupture or use of an endo-bag may be helpful. The loss of gallstones and their retention in the abdominal cavity should be noted in the description of the surgical procedure."

Videoscopic staging offers a higher degree of accuracy among these patients, with minimal complications and a shorter recovery time than with exploratory laparotomy. The addition of laparoscopic sonography and peritoneal lavage may further increase sensitivity to unresectable disease.

CD009323,0,10803831,0,The role of laparoscopy in the treatment of intra-abdominal malignancies.,"The role of laparoscopy in the care of patients with cancer is currently evolving. Numerous experimental and clinical studies have attempted to elucidate the nature and cause of port-site metastases--particularly to discern whether they simply are a marker of advanced disease, or if they are a result of the laparoscopic intervention. Laparoscopy has a role in establishing the diagnosis of cancer in some situations by allowing biopsy of intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal masses, lymph nodes, and visceral lesions, as well as examination of abdominal contents under direct vision or with ultrasound probes. Laparoscopy is useful in the staging of established malignancies such as pancreatic cancer, hepatic lesions, lymphoma, and esophageal cancer. Laparoscopy also has a role in the surgical treatment of a variety of malignancies, including gastric carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, splenic malignancies, adrenal cancers, and colon cancer. The safety of laparoscopy for the definitive resection of colon cancer has not yet been proven, and until the results of a randomized prospective trial currently underway are known, should be performed only in the context of a clinical trial. Lastly, laparoscopy can play an important role in the palliative care of the cancer patient in performing procedures such as feeding-tube placement or intestinal stoma creation. It is imperative that using laparoscopy in the care of patients with malignancies be carefully and thoroughly evaluated since this technique can either benefit or adversely affect survival or quality of life."
CD009323,0,10804003,0,Anomalous insertion of the right hepatic duct into the cystic duct: report of a case diagnosed before laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Although an aberrant hepatic duct entering the cystic duct is not especially rare, the main right hepatic duct entering the cystic duct is extremely rare, with only six cases reported thus far. All of the reported patients underwent open cholecystectomy, during which one patient received a bile duct injury. The anomaly was unsuspected preoperatively in all of these cases. We report an additional patient with this anomaly, the first such case diagnosed before laparoscopic cholecystectomy using direct cholangiography. Cholangiography may be mandatory whenever biliary anomalies are suspected during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. As the right hepatic duct entering the cystic duct can lead to ductal injury, this anomaly should be kept in mind when performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy."

From 600 titles, 105 were read and left for analysis. Other 21 articles were from the 6th Biliary Surgical Congress and this hospital. Severe complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy were identified in 409 patients (0.4%), bile duct injury accounted for 0.32%, postoperative cystic duct leak and bile leak for 0.11% and 0.20% respectively. Peritoneal abscess and bowel injury occurred in 0.07% and 0.06% of cases, and postoperative hemorrhages were identified in 0.1% of the cases. Fourteen (0.04%) postoperative deaths resulted from operative injury. The data demonstrate that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is an operation which associated with low morbidity and mortality. But bile duct injury is still a problem, and complications of laparoscopic cholecystetomy can be minimized by improving operative procedure."

CD009323,0,10774975,0,Minimally invasive surgery: hepatobiliary-pancreatic and foregut.,"This review is confined to the liver, biliary tract, pancreas, and foregut (oesophagus and stomach). The issues relating to laparoscopic cholecystectomy mainly concern the bile duct injuries associated with this operation. This review provides some evidence that although the risk for this iatrogenic injury is declining, it continues to be a problem and is accompanied by significant morbidity, mortality, and a huge escalation in care costs. Laparoscopic clearance of ductal stones is undoubtedly safe and effective, and issues have now focused on comparisons between this form of management and orthodox endoscopic clearance. Laparoscopic cardiomyotomy may well replace other forms of treatment of achalasia, including balloon dilation and botulinum toxin injection. As the results of laparoscopic antireflux surgery have been so good in the medium term, the question of medical versus laparoscopic treatment is being addressed by two randomized clinical trials. Gastric resection is established only in respect of excision of mesenchymal tumours. Gastric surgery for advanced gastric cancer must still be regarded as developmental. Laparoscopic liver resections and in situ ablation are still confined to developing centres, but the early results are promising. However, simpler hepatic procedures, such as de-roofing of symptomatic simple hepatic cysts, are well established and in widespread practice. Only a few centres have published their results on laparoscopic pancreatic surgery. The early reported outcome for internal drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, enucleation of benign insulinomas, and distal pancreatic resections has been good, but the experience is limited."

CD009323,0,10776880,1,Laparoscopic ultrasound enhances diagnostic laparoscopy in the staging of intra-abdominal neoplasms.,"Routine laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) for staging intra-abdominal malignancies remains controversial. Thus, we undertook a prospective study to assess the value of preoperative laparoscopy with LUS for patients with intra-abdominal tumors judged resectable by preoperative studies. Laparoscopy was successfully performed in 76 of 77 patients, and 60 underwent LUS. Of 33 patients with presumed pancreatic cancer, laparoscopic findings changed the operative management of 11 patients, and LUS altered the management of an additional 6 patients. Laparotomy was avoided in 9 patients (27%). Among 14 patients with hepatobiliary tumors, laparotomy was avoided in 9 patients in whom laparoscopy and/or LUS revealed either benign or advanced disease. Operative management was altered in 4 of 18 patients with gastric or esophageal cancer by laparoscopic findings. LUS did not add to the management of these patients. Of 12 patients with presumed intra-abdominal lymphoma, 9 were diagnosed with lymphoma and 3 with benign disease, without laparotomy in all but 1 case. Laparoscopy and LUS are valuable tools for evaluating the resectability of pancreatic and hepatobiliary tumors. Laparoscopy, and to a lesser degree LUS, greatly facilitates diagnosing patients with intra-abdominal lymphomas and spares an occasional patient with esophagogastric carcinoma from undergoing laparotomy."
CD009323,0,10776875,0,The role of hepatic resection in the management of bile duct injuries following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"The creation of a specialized hepatobiliary surgery unit at our medical center has resulted in referral of 16 patients with bile duct complications following laparoscopic cholecystectomy over the last 18 months. No patient required conversion to open cholecystectomy. Although no injury was recognized at the time of surgery, 15 of 16 patients became symptomatic within the first 30 days. Two patients died from sepsis and multisystem organ failure after protracted hospital courses. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and/or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography determined diagnosis and level of injury. Six of seven patients with cystic duct leak underwent successful endoscopic stent placement and one patient sealed spontaneously after percutaneous drainage of a large biloma. Nine patients required surgery that included hepaticojejunostomy (five), T-tube insertion and drainage of abscess (two), or segmental hepatic resection (two). Timely recognition of bile duct complications following laparoscopic cholecystectomy is critical to a successful long-term outcome. Although the majority of cystic duct leaks can be managed with endoscopic stenting, patients with ductal injuries require hepaticojejunostomy. Segmental liver resection may serve an important role in the management of carefully selected patients with high intrahepatic injuries to avoid long-term transhepatic stenting and complications such as episodic cholangitis and late stricture formation."

CD009323,0,10769085,0,Is CT angiography sufficient for prediction of resectability of periampullary neoplasms?,"The optimal preoperative evaluation of periampullary neoplasms remains controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze the accuracy of helical computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction in predicting resectability. Between March 1996 and May 1999, a total of 100 patients with periampullary neoplasms were prospectively staged by helical CT and CT angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction. Vascular involvement was graded from 0 to 4, with grade 0 representing no vascular involvement and grade 4 total encasement of either the superior mesenteric vein or artery. Patients with grade 4 lesions were considered unresectable. Sixty-eight patients underwent surgical exploration with intent to perform a pancreaticoduodenectomy. Forty-four lesions were grade 0, five were grade l, eight were grade 2, and 11 were grade 3. Resectability for grades 0 to 3 was 96%, 100%, 50%, and 9%, respectively, for an overall resectability rate of 76%. Resectability in patients with vascular encroachment (grade 2) is usually determined by the extent of local disease rather than the presence of extrapancreatic disease. Resection is rarely possible in patients with evidence of vascular encasement (grade 3). Additional imaging modalities such as diagnostic laparoscopy are superfluous in patients with no evidence of local vascular involvement on CT angiography (grades 0 and 1) because of the high resectability rate and infrequency of unsuspected distant metastatic deposits."

Leiomyomas and other benign gastric tumors are readily removed, and in Asia early gastric cancers are removed with these techniques. Large pancreatic pseudocysts abutting the posterior wall of the stomach may be drained through the stomach using an endogastric approach. Lastly, intragastric bleeding in areas not reachable with a conventional endoscope may be approached with an endogastric approach. Although the indications for these procedures are-in general-rare, they are not difficult to perform, and outcomes have been superb."
CD009323,0,10728806,0,Hepatobiliary surgery.,"The transformation of liver and biliary tract surgery into a full speciality began with the application of functional anatomy to segmental surgery in the 1950's, reinforced by ultrasound and new imaging techniques. The spectrum of gall-stone disease encountered by the hepatobiliary surgeon has changed with the laparoscopic approach to cholecystectomy. There is increased need for conservation techniques to repair the bile duct injuries that arise more often in the laparoscopic approach to cholecystectomy. These and other surgical interventions on the bile ducts should be selected as a function of risk versus benefit in relation to the patient's requirements and the institutional expertise. Bile duct cancers, including hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder cancers have a dismal reputation, but evidence is accumulating for better survivals from aggressive approaches performed by specialist hepatobiliary surgeons. Hepatic surgery has increased in safety and effectiveness, largely due to the segmental approach, but also to experience with techniques for vascular control and exclusion used in liver transplantation. Techniques such as portal vein embolisation, which induces hypertrophy of the future remnant liver, percutaneous local tumour destruction using cryotherapy or radiofrequency tumour coagulation and more effective chemotherapy are beginning to increase the number of patients who can undergo curative resection. In liver transplantation, segmental surgery has been applied to graft reduction and to split liver grafts, and is opening new perspectives for living donor transplantation. Today the limitation to survival in primary and metastatic liver cancer lies not in the surgical technique but in the difficulty of dealing with microscopic and extrahepatic disease. Progress in these fields will enable the hepatobiliary surgeon to further extend the possibilities for proposing curative resections."

Open fundoplication concomitant with primary button, primary open button and laparoscopic fundoplication concomitant with primary button were performed in 20, 15 and 7 patients respectively. The average longevity +/- standard deviation of all buttons was 388.36 +/- 360.35 days. The average longevity of the buttons of the laparoscopic fundoplication group was significantly lower than the others. The major causes of removal of Bard buttons were valve incompetence and flap damage, whereas, balloon leakage was the major cause of removal of the Mic-key button. There were merely minor stomal complications and no gastric separation and peritonitis. Because of the acceptable longevity of the buttons and minimal complications, we concluded that the primary gastrostomy button was the preferable method of long term enteral feeding in children."

CD009323,0,10696842,0,Small-bowel endoscopy.,"During the last year, several interesting publications have further confirmed the role of enteroscopy in clinical practice. Of particular interest have been various articles concerning the use of two-way enteroscopy in large series of patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding or with radiological abnormalities. Reports continue to appear describing a high incidence of gastroduodenal or colonic lesions that were missed or misinterpreted during previous upper and lower endoscopies in patients with recurrent obscure bleeding. By contrast, there have been few outcome studies on patients with obscure bleeding, and the conclusions reached are not in full agreement. Other important publications have stressed the value of enteroscopy in selected cases of chronic unexplained diarrhea, for diagnosing small-bowel lesions caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and in identifying small-bowel tumors. In addition to numerous reports on intraoperative enteroscopy, the results of initial experience with laparoscopically assisted enteroscopy have also been reported."
CD009323,0,10695743,0,Surgical treatment of biliary tract infections.,"Despite major advances in surgical and nonsurgical therapy, biliary tract infections remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The two classic biliary tract infections most commonly encountered are acute cholecystitis (either calculous or acalculous) and acute cholangitis. In addition, bile leakage associated with bile duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become a problem not infrequently encountered by surgeons. Acute calculous cholecystitis results from a combination of mechanical, biochemical, and infectious mechanisms, initiated by stone impaction in the cystic duct. After instituting empiric antibiotics, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed. Although conversion to open cholecystectomy is more common than in chronic cholecystitis, there appears to be no increased morbidity or mortality in that setting. Acute acalculous cholecystitis usually occurs in critically ill patients and may present both a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. Aggressive management, however, is warranted, both because of the critical nature of illness in these patients and the high incidence of perforation. Percutaneous cholecystostomy is indicated, particularly in high-risk patients both for diagnosis and treatment. Acute cholangitis results from a combination of bactibilia and biliary obstruction. The majority of patients can be successfully managed with intravenous antibiotics and fluid resuscitation. In those patients in whom initial management is not successful, biliary drainage, which is best accomplished nonoperatively, should be instituted. There is a very limited role for early surgical intervention in acute suppurative cholangitis. Biliary leaks resulting in bile ""peritonitis"" or bilomas are common sequelae of laparoscopic bile duct injury. Although surgeons may feel it is necessary to operate urgently, delineation of the proximal biliary anatomy via percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and biliary stent placement is the appropriate first step in management. This procedure will usually control the bile leak and allow delineation of the anatomy and opportune timing of definitive reconstruction."
CD009323,0,10694080,0,Posterior hepatic duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy finally necessitating hepatic resection: case report.,"A case of bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy finally necessitating right hepatic lobectomy is reported to re-emphasize the importance of preoperative and intraoperative assessment of the biliary tree. A 47-year-old Japanese woman underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystolithiasis. On postoperative day 5, fever and right hypochondralgia developed, and CT revealed fluid collection at the right hypochondrium. Percutaneous drainage was performed, and subsequent fistulography revealed a communication of the cystic cavity with the right posterior bile duct, which suggested injury of the aberrant hepatic duct. Conservative therapy, including the adaptation of fibrin glue, was performed, but closure of the fistula and cavity was not obtainable. Finally, a right hepatic lobectomy was performed four months after cholecystectomy. In this case, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was unsuccessful preoperatively, and intraoperative cholangiography was not done. This case report re-emphasizes that the preoperative and intraoperative examination of the biliary tree is mandatory to avoid bile duct injury."

Being difficult to diagnose during routine preoperative studies, these anomalies can provide surgeons with an unusual surprise during laparoscopic surgery. The presence of any congenital anomaly or the mere suspicion of its existence demands that we exercise surgical prudence, limit the use of electrocoagulation, and ensure that no structure be divided until a clear picture of the bile ducts and blood vessels is obtained. If necessary, perform intraoperative cholangiography to further define the biliary system. However, if the case remains unclear, or if laparoscopy does not provide enough information, open surgery should be considered before undesirable complications occur."

Hepatobiliary surgeons are now able to use laparoscopy, immunosuppressive drugs, and technical advances in cryosurgery to accomplish magnificent results. The success and safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, orthotopic liver transplantation, and trisegmentectomy for hepatic tumors depend on a high regard for and an accurate knowledge of the anatomy and some of the common embryologic anomalies of the biliary tree.

CD009323,0,10674747,0,Interval laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the management of acute biliary pancreatitis.,"The timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy following an attack of acute biliary pancreatitis is controversial. The traditional approach of interval cholecystectomy has been challenged recently. The present study was designed to evaluate the benefits of interval laparoscopic cholecystectomy for patients with mild acute pancreatitis (Ranson less than 3). Nineteen patients with mild pancreatitis underwent ultrasonographic evaluation to confirm the biliary etiology. ERCP was performed in all patients on the first available endoscopy list, and endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed in two patients with calculi or dilated common bile duct on ultrasonographic examination. Medical treatment was administered and laparoscopic cholecystectomy was scheduled after 8-12 weeks to allow the inflammatory process to settle. There were no recurrent attacks of pancreatitis during this period. The degree of difficulty of the laparoscopic procedure was assessed by the presence of adhesions to the gallbladder area, difficulty of dissection in the Calot's triangle, intraoperative bleeding and the need for a drain. Six patients (31.5%) had severe adhesions, difficult dissection of the cystic duct and artery, bleeding and prolonged operating time. In two of these patients (10.5%) the procedure was converted to open cholecystectomy. In conclusion, our results suggest that postponing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in acute pancreatitis patients is not advantageous surgically and does not justify the risk of further morbidity caused by the gallbladder disease."
CD009323,0,10670103,0,[Laparoscopic management of echinococcal cysts of the liver].,"Even though echinococcal cysts have been cured by puncture and instillation of scolicidal medications, surgery is still the mainstay of the treatment of hydatid disease. The aim of the surgical treatment is the elimination of scolices, the removal of all viable parts of the cyst and the obliteration of the remaining cavity. This can be achieved by resective procedures, but also by a more conservative approach with drainage and obliteration of the cyst. The latter procedure can be done by open surgery or laparoscopically. The disadvantages of the laparoscopic approach are the increased danger of contamination of the abdominal cavity with scolices and difficulties to aspirate a highly viscous cyst content. Furthermore, cysts which are located deep in the parenchyma of the liver should not be approached laparoscopically because of the significant danger of hemorrhage. The advantage of the laparoscopic approach in selected cysts, i.e. those which are located superficially and having a liquid content, are a shorter hospital stay, lower incidence of wound infection and the ability of the surgeon to inspect the inside of the cyst more thoroughly and rule out daughter cysts and connections to the biliary tract. A review of the literature (n = 76) indicates that in most laparoscopically treated hydatid cysts of the liver a simple drainage (59%) or an unroofing (31%) is performed. The complication rate is 21%. Because there are no longterm observations after laparoscopic operations for hydatid disease the question of recurrence cannot yet be answered."
CD009323,0,10667815,0,Gallbladder carcinoma during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: is it associated with bad prognosis?,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for gallstone disease. The ultrasonogram has failed for the early detection of gallbladder cancer, especially if inflammation (chronic or acute) is present. Incidental gallbladder could be an important cancer finding during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, due to the potential cancer cell dissemination during the procedure. In our Department, 6500 laparoscopic cholecystectomies have been performed in the last 5 years and in 15 cases (0.23%) gallbladder cancer was found during surgery or after histological examination of the resected gallbladder. In none of these 15 patients was pre-operative diagnosis of gallbladder carcinoma postulated. When re-evaluation of the pre-operative ultrasonograms was done, it was possible to observe signs suggesting the presence of neoplastic infiltration in 4 of them (28.6%). During videoscopic exploration, also in 4 patients, the suspicion of gallbladder cancer was noted. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was completed in 9 patients. In 2 of them, in situ or mucosal invasion was demonstrated with a long survival. One patient presented recurrence at the biliary hilum 2,5 years after surgery. Six patients were re-operated and in 4 of them peritoneal or port site metastasis was found; all died early (4.5 month median survival). The other 2 patients were submitted to liver bed resection and lymph node dissection. These patients are free of cancer recurrence after 15 months of follow-up. Six patients were converted to open surgery, performing palliative procedures and died before the 12 month follow-up. The suspicion of pre-operative gallbladder cancer is generally unlikely to be confirmed based on ultrasonographic signs; but, in some cases with high suspicion, further investigation (TAC, tumor markers, etc.) must be indicated in order to avoid poor results. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be associated with bad prognosis, and then, when gallbladder cancer is suspected during the laparoscopic procedure, conversion to open surgery could be the best choice."

We describe the technique of laparoscopic side-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy for chronic pancreatitis in five patients. The procedure is performed using five trocars. Stapling and direct suturing are required. Careful selection of patients is important. Preoperative and intraoperative ultrasound is necessary to assess the dilated pancreatic duct. In one of the five patients, the laparoscopic technique was converted to an open procedure because the preoperative findings were not confirmed at exploration. Four of the five patients are pain-free, with 5- to 30-month follow-up. Laparoscopic pancreaticojejunostomy can be performed safely, and it is a procedure that should be considered in the treatment of appropriate patients with chronic pancreatitis."

The procedure was completed in 291 with a conversion rate to open cholecystectomy of 3.9% and a median postoperative length of stay of two days, range zero to nine days. In eighteen patients the indication for LC was failure of symptoms to settle, two of whom required conversion (11.1%). Diathermy dissection was avoided in Calot's triangle and dissection started at the junction of Hartmann's pouch and cystic duct with full mobilisation of this area prior to clip application. Pre-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ERCP was performed in patients suspected of having common bile duct stones without routine intra-operative cholangiography.

CD009323,0,10633935,0,[Recent progress in the curative surgical treatment of stomach cancer].,"Surgical resection is currently the only potentially curative treatment for gastric cancer. Nodal extension, present in 3/4 of the patients, is related to topography and penetration of the tumor and is progressive, beginning by the perigastric proximal lymph nodes N1 to the perivascular distal nodes N2. A subtotal gastrectomy is possible for distal cancers and total gastrectomy is necessary for cancers of the middle and upper portions. D1 lymphadenectomy is the resection of the N1 perigastric nodes (> 15) and D2 lymphadenectomy is the resection fo the N2 perivascular nodes (> 25). In Japan, 5 year survival after D2 resection is very high, around 60%, but all the series are retrospective with a high proportion of superficial cancers. In several recent European controlled studies, D2 resection is responsible for a high mortality rate (> 10%) and the reported 45% survival is not statistically different from the D1 resection. In Western patients an ""in-between"" lymphadenectomy without spleno-pancreatectomy can be recommended with analysis of at least 15 nodes, and with a mortality lower than 5%. Pathological analysis of the operative specimen allows to use the new TNM classification where the number of positive lymph nodes is the main independent prognostic factor."
CD009323,0,10633143,0,Ultrasound of the hepatobiliary-pancreatic system.,"Ultrasound (US) remains an excellent first line investigation of the gallbladder and for indicating diagnoses and defining levels of extrahepatic biliary obstruction and screening for liver metastases. It is extremely useful in assisting interventional procedures and assessing the status of hepatic vessels. As a nonoperative procedure, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can accurately locate and locally stage pathology of the pancreas and periampullary region and even provide reliable biopsy evidence in experienced hands. A limitation, of course, is its field-of-view restriction, which prevents identification of distant metastatic disease. This restriction is not present with laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS), which apart from being an operative procedure, has all the other advantages of EUS and in addition can identify nodal, hepatic, and extrahepatic metastatic spread. Greater use of intraoperative biopsy should assist in identifying nodal disease but requires the readily available services of a pathologist. Local disease may be even more definable using the newer technology of intraductal ultrasound (IDUS). Intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS), whether direct or via the laparoscope, is now an indispensable tool for all surgeons who want to perform hepatobiliary-pancreatic surgery at the highest level."
CD009323,0,10631360,0,A prospective analysis of staging laparoscopy in patients with primary and secondary hepatobiliary malignancies.,"Laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound are used widely in cancer staging and are perceived to prevent unnecessary open exploration in many patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of staging laparoscopy in improving resectability in patients with primary and secondary hepatobiliary malignancies. Over a 10-month period (November 1, 1997 to August 31, 1998), 186 patients with primary and secondary hepatobiliary cancers were submitted to operation for potentially curative resection. One hundred four patients staged laparoscopically (LAP) before laparotomy were compared prospectively to 82 patients undergoing exploration without laparoscopy (NO LAP). Assignment to each group was not random but was based on surgeon practice. Demographic data, diagnoses, the extent of preoperative evaluation, and the percentage of patients resected were similar in the two groups. Laparoscopy identified 26 (67%) of 39 patients with unresectable disease. In the NO LAP group, 28 patients (34%) had unresectable disease discovered at laparotomy. In patients with unresectable disease and submitted to biopsy only, the operating times were similar in the two groups (LAP 83 +/- 22 minutes vs. NO LAP 91 +/- 33 minutes; P = 0.4). However, laparoscopic staging significantly reduced the length of hospital stay (LAP 2.2 +/- 2 days vs. NO LAP 8.5 +/- 8.6 days; P = 0.006). Likewise, total hospital charges, normalized to 100 in the NO LAP patients, were significantly lower in the LAP group (LAP 54 +/- 42 vs. NO LAP 100 +/- 84; P = 0.02). Staging laparoscopy identified the majority of patients with unresectable hepatobiliary malignancies, significantly improved resectability, and reduced the number of days in the hospital and the total charges. The yield of laparoscopy was greatest for detecting peritoneal metastases (9 of 10), additional hepatic tumors (10 of 12), and unsuspected advanced cirrhosis (5 of 5) but often failed to identify nonresectability because of lymph node metastases, vascular involvement, or extensive biliary involvement. Eighty-three percent of patients subjected to laparotomy after laparoscopy underwent a potentially curative resection compared to 66% of those who were not staged laparoscopically."

The device, which essentially consists of a hand cuff with a spiral inflatable valve, enables withdrawal and reinsertion of the hand without loss of pneumoperitoneum during the operation. The cuff's effective sealing pressure is equal to the pneumoperitoneal pressure; hence, hand comfort is maintained during the intervention. The device was effective in maintaining pneumoperitoneum in all cases. All but one operation was completed with the HALS approach. The one conversion was due to bleeding from the superior mesenteric vein during a 90% pancreaticosplenectomy. Immediate effective control of the bleeding by compression between the thumb and index finger was achieved, and the cuff of the Omniport was deflated as the incision was enlarged. There were no postoperative complications. The HALS approach has distinct advantages in terms of exposure and safety over the total laparoscopic technique for major surgery on the liver and pancreas, and it is recommended for these interventions."

CD009323,0,10615786,0,[Treatment of gastric cancer].,"Gastric cancer (GC) still remains a major cancer problem in the world. Its prognosis is poor with an overall 5-year survival rate less than 20%. Surgical resection is still the only curative treatment of GC. Curative resection depends on tumoral location and extension, particularly lymph node involvement. Proximal GC (fundus, body) are treated by total gastrectomy (TG). For distal GC (antrum, pylorus), the TG is no more the recommended treatment and distal sub-total gastrectomy can safely be performed when carcinologic rules are respected: 5-6 cm free margin for the remnant stomach and at least 2 cm resection of the proximal duodenum. Cardia cancers, upon to their tumoral extension toward the esophagus, can require either TG or proximal esophagogastrectomy by combined thoracic and abdominal approach. As demonstrated in the last controlled studies, D2 extensive lymphadenectomy, in spite of its contribution to a better prognostic staging, does not improve long term survival after curative surgery. TG extended to the spleen or to the pancreas should not be performed in curative surgery because of a high rate of postoperative complications. Limited gastric resections for superficial GC have to be evaluated in Western countries. Palliative exploratory laparotomies should be avoided by better preoperative explorations. Laparoscopic staging in GC could be indicated when palliative resection or bypass are possible. The results of adjuvant chemotherapy is still disappointing and new protocols have to be evaluated. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy with or without hyperthermia represents a serious hope in the treatment of GC, but its significative action on the survival is not well demonstrated, while its morbidity and mortality rate is high."

CD009323,0,10596335,0,The laparoscopic treatment of non-parasitic liver cysts. Five years experience.,"The incidence of cystic liver lesions seems to be more frequent as previously suggested. The treatment of symptomatic non-parasitic cysts is controversial. Ultrasonography (US) or computer tomography (CT) guided drainage and/or sclerotization versus surgical fenestration or partial resection, even liver resection has been advocated. Recently with the development of laparoscopic surgery this minimal invasive approach was also applied in the surgical treatment of single or multiple cystic lesions. Between 1994 and April 1999 21 patients with non-parasitic cysts were treated by laparoscopic fenestration or partial resection at the 1st Department of Surgery, Semmelweis University of Medicine. In 13 cases the symptomatic cyst presented the indication for surgery, while in the others cholelithiasis and GERD was the primary cause of intervention in 7 and 1 patient respectively. There were 16 woman and 5 men with a mean age of 42.3 years (17-78). The cyst was solitary in 17 cases and multiple 3-6-number in four patients. The size varied between 1.5-25 cm (average 7.2 cm). Patients were selected for the laparoscopic approach according to the US and/or CT appearance and superficial localization of the cyst. Wide unroofing or partial resection of the cyst wall till the margin of normal liver tissue was performed in all cases. The cystic cavity was drained. All operations were completed laparoscopically. Intraoperative complication did not occur. Bleeding from the resected margin could be well controlled by electrocautery or clipping. Patients left the ward after the drains were removed on postoperative day 2-4 depending upon the amount of serious discharge. No complication was observed postoperatively. During the average of 12.5 months (1 to 54 months) follow-up of 19 patients no recurrence was observed. Two patients required reoperation. In one 17 year old male patient cystadenocarcinoma was verified by histology, upon reoperation the lesion was found unresectable. In another case left hemi-hepatectomy was performed because of cyst recurrence caused by cholangiocell adenoma. In selected cases of superficially located symptomatic, non-parasitic cysts the laparoscopic fenestration might be the first choice of treatment. The method is safe and effective in the hands of surgeons experienced in both laparoscopic and liver surgery. Careful exploration of the cystic cavity and histological examination of the resected cyst wall is mandatory to avoid diagnostic mishaps."

CD009323,0,10586020,0,Laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) in gastrointestinal surgery.,"Intraoperative ultrasonography during abdominal surgery became widespread by availability of high-frequency, high-resolution transducers. It's usefulness has particularly been proven in biliar and gastrointestinal surgery. Our objective was to examine the method in laparoscopic cholecystectomy and in laparoscopic staging of malignancies of the upper gastrointestinal tract as well. Lapaoscopic ultrasound (LUS) examination was performed in 567 patients operated on because of biliary stones and in 12 patients with carcinoma in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract. In accordance to the known criteria endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed in 89 patients, and additionally, ERCP was performed in 58 patients because of dilated common bile duct. Choledochal stones were demonstrated in 72 of the 147 patients. Laparoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated preoperatively undetected bile duct stones in 18 of these patients (12%). In 294 other patients without any criteria of bile duct stones, laparoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated bile duct stones in 11 patients (4%). Laparoscopic ultrasonography in 12 patients with proximal gastrointestinal malignancies demonstrated inoperability in all of the patients. Laparotomy could thereby be avoided. LUS examination is an ideal operative tool as it is safe, reproducible and requires no special patient preparation or positioning. The method of imaging is therefore justified for patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery because of biliary stones and gastrointestinal surgery."

Furthermore, the effects of TBS have not yet been clearly evaluated. Between 1995 and 1997, TBS was performed on 11 patients with intractable epigastric and/or flank pain due to unresectable pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis, or an unknown cause. The effect of TBS on the pain was evaluated using a novel simple pain score and pain reduction percentage scaled on the basis of the medication and the judgments by patients themselves, respectively. The detection and cutting of the bilateral great splanchnic nerves were easily performed in all of the patients using common flexible chondrocostal retractors. The evaluation of the TBS effect using the pain score clearly demonstrated the early and late mean postoperative pain score (1.1 +/- 0.9 and 1.4 +/- 1.2: mean +/- SD) to be significantly (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.002, respectively) lower than the preoperative pain score (3.5 +/- 0.7). Furthermore, the mean postoperative pain reduction percentage (85% +/- 13%) evaluated by those patients was also significantly different (P < 0.0001). The present study showed no significant complications for TBS, except for minor complications such as the transient fall of blood pressure and reparable pleural damage. Interestingly, a long-term follow-up revealed that no complications related to the splanchnicotomy were observed.

The additional value of laparoscopic contact ultrasonography (LCU) was also evaluated with specific regard to its ability to detect hepatic metastases and assess vascular infiltration of the portomesenteric trunk. A consecutive sample of 50 patients referred for operation of a suspected pancreatic cancer were submitted to preoperative contrast-enhanced high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and staging laparoscopy combined with LCU at a university hospital. For those progressing to exploratory laparotomy, the intraoperative findings relating to tumor diffusion and vascular infiltration were compared to CT, laparoscopic, and LCU data. Analytical description of the laparoscopic findings is given. Row data of predicted versus observed vascular infiltration were tabulated for CT and LCU. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of each diagnostic test were calculated for comparative analysis. Laparoscopy alone prevented unnecessary laparotomy in 20% of cases. A complete procedure could not be achieved in 28% of patients. Three false-negative staging results occurred. LCU identified small (benign) hepatic nodules not seen by CT in 8% of patients. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy for assessing vascular infiltration were 82%, 53%, and 69% for CT and 94%, 80%, and 87% for LCU. Laparoscopy was confirmed to be safe and effective for staging pancreatic cancer. Because of its unique capabilities to detect even small peritoneal tumor deposits a quick exploration immediately before laparotomy is advised in all patients. The additional benefit of a more extensive procedure is not supported by our results. Although LCU appears to define the vascular involvement more accurately than conventional CT, the limitation of getting clinically useful ultrasound data in all the patients suggests its adoption in only a selected population."

It is related to a very low index of complications and does not present difficulties concerning access and exposure of intrabdominal structures."
CD009323,0,10488585,0,[Surgical alternatives in the treatment of hepatic hydatidosis].,"Echinococcosis is an endemic zoonosis in the south of Chile, so we have the opportunity to treat many patients especially the liver location which is the most common situation of this disease. Hepatic hydatid cyst presents its own morbidity and mortality due its complications and associated with surgical procedures. Morbidity has rates between 11 and 86% and is related with previous surgical interventions, cysts complications, the necessity of perform additional procedures during surgery and the treatment of other disease locations. Mortality by otherwise has rates below 5%. But both, morbidity and mortality persist high in spite of technological advances and therapeutical improvement. The surgical treatment of hepatic hydatidosis can be divided in four phases: surgical area isolation, cysts evacuation, treatment of cyst complications (biliary tract rupture, hepatothoracic transit, etc.), and residual cavity treatment. For each one exist different alternatives. On the other hand, hydatid cyst surgery can be classified in conservative and resective procedures. In the first group we consider marsupialization, cystostomy, Knowsly or Posadas operation and cystojejunostomy. In the resective group we include pericystectomy, partial or subtotal cystectomy and the different types of hepatectomies. Finally, some other surgical procedures are under evaluation. These include the laparoscopic approach of liver echinoccosis with few studies in the field, but with hopeful results."

Technique and initial experiences].,"The aim of the present paper is to describe the development of a standardized technique of laparoscopic cholecystectomy using mini-instruments in order to demonstrate its feasibility with no increase in the risk of the patient. For this purpose, the prospective data of the first 60 patients that appeared suitable to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy with mini-instruments were recorded initially, 45 patients were operated on using a 10 mm, 30 degrees standard laparoscope inserted via the umbilicus, together with two mini-instruments and a standard instrument inserted under the right costal arch. The subsequent 15 interventions were performed using, in addition to a 10 mm standard trocar placed in the umbilicus to accommodate the 10 mm laparoscope, three subcostal employed mini-trocars. For the special surgical steps involved in intraoperative cholangiography, and the clipping of the cystic duct and cystic artery, a minilaparoscope was introduced through the epigastric port. Fifty-five of the patients were women, their average age was 47.6 years and the mean BMI 23.5. The sole intraoperative complication seen was bleeding from the liver that made necessary conversion to a 5 mm port to aspirate the coagulum. Conversion to a standard 5 mm instrument was also required in two cases of broken forceps and in one case with a thick-walled gallbladder in which the mini grasping forceps proved too weak. The mean operating time was 62.4 min, and no postoperative complications occurred. For elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy including intraoperative cholangiography in slim patients, the use of mini-instruments is not associated with any increased risk of complications, and the operating time is acceptable. However, the general use of mini-instruments cannot as yet be recommended because of the less-than-optimal properties of the mini-instruments and the reduced optical quality of the mini-laparoscopes."

CD009323,0,10457331,0,Staging laparoscopy for pancreatic cancer should be used to select the best means of palliation and not only to maximize the resectability rate.,"Staging laparoscopy, based on the assumption that endobiliary stenting is the best palliation, allegedly saves an ""unnecessary"" laparotomy for incurable pancreatic cancer. Our aim was to determine survival of patients with clinically resectable pancreatic cancer that is found to be unresectable intraoperatively and thereby infer appropriate utilization of staging laparoscopy. A retrospective analysis was undertaken of 148 patients with ductal adenocarcinoma (1985 to 1992) with a clinically resectable lesion based on current imaging techniques. All were considered candidates for resection but were deemed unresectable at operation because of metastases to the liver (group I; 29 patients), the peritoneum (group II; 22 patients), or distant lymph nodes (group III; 44 patients) or because of vascular invasion (group IV; 53 patients). Overall median survival was 9 months (range 1 to 53 months), but by group was as follows: group I, 6 months; group II, 7 months; group III, 11 months; and group IV, 11 months. Individual comparisons showed shorter survival for patients with distant nodal, liver, or peritoneal metastases than with nodal or vascular involvement (P<0.03). Staging laparoscopy should be performed to identify patients with liver or peritoneal metastases who have an expected survival of approximately 6 months, in whom short-term endoscopic palliation is satisfactory. Extended laparoscopy to identify lymph node or vascular involvement is contingent upon which palliation (operative vs. endoscopic) is considered most appropriate. Because we believe operative bypass provides better, more durable palliation in this latter group, we have not adopted extended laparoscopy."
CD009323,0,10449975,0,Technical aspects of left-sided pancreatic resection for cancer.,"Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that originates to the left of the portal vein, i.e. in the body or tail of the pancreas, is seen in approximately one third of all cases with exocrine pancreatic cancer. Except for symptoms of pain and weight loss, these patients usually appear normal upon physical examination. In 5-10% of cases, the tumor is resectable by standard surgical procedures. Unresectability is due to local spread (30-40%) or distant metastases (50-65%). The technique of distal pancreatic resection was outlined by Mayo in 1913. The intimate relationship of the splenic artery and vein to the body of the pancreas makes en bloc mobilization of the spleen and pancreatic tail a safe option; the splenic artery and vein being ligated near their origin and termination. Although the spleen can frequently be preserved when performing a distal pancreatectomy for benign disease, splenic artery preservation is hazardous for oncologic radicality when resection is performed for cancer. Therefore, splenectomy is routine in distal pancreatectomy - in Mayo's and all subsequent descriptions - with the splenic artery being ligated early in the procedure. Recent reports from specialized centers indicate that the procedure is associated with a decrease in mortality rate, often zero or less than a few percent."
CD009323,0,10449813,1,Laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasonography in the TNM staging of pancreatic carcinoma.,"A prospective study was performed comparing laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasonography (LapUS), transabdominal ultrasonography (USS), computed tomography (CT), and selective visceral angiography with portal phase venography (SVA) for the assessment of resectability in 50 patients with pancreatic or periampullary cancer. The results were stratified by TNM stages. Tumor unresectability was demonstrated in 36 patients (72%). The sensitivity of LapUS for demonstrating the index lesion was 96%. Laparoscopic ultrasonography failed to predict factors precluding resection by T stage in six patients, and there were no significant differences in the ability of any modality to predict local resectability (predictive value 58-73%). Laparoscopic ultrasonography did not overestimate T stage and was significantly more specific for assessing unresectability compared with USS (100% vs. 64%, p<0.05) and CT (100% vs. 47%, p<0.005). No imaging investigation was able to assess the N stage accurately. Metastases were confirmed in 16 patients (32%), with LapUS proving significantly more sensitive than USS (94% vs. 29%, p<0.001) and CT (94% vs. 33%, p<0.005). The addition of LapUS to the laparoscopic examination did not change the M stage in any patient, as all metastases were superficially located. Laparoscopy with LapUS was the most reliable method for assessing overall tumour resectability and was significantly more predictive than CT (97% vs. 79%, p<0.005). These results confirm that laparoscopy is indispensable for detecting occult intraabdominal metastases. LapUS reliably predicts tumor unresectability, offsetting the tendency of USS and CT to overestimate T stage. Methods of accurate N staging remain elusive, and the use of routine SVA is not justified."

CD009323,0,10436817,0,Intraoperative methods to stage and localize pancreatic and duodenal tumors.,"Intraoperative methods to stage and localize tumors have dramatically improved. Advances include less invasive methods to obtain comparable results and precise localization of previously occult tumors. The use of new technology including laparoscopy and ultrasound has provided some of these advances, while improved operative techniques have provided others. Laparoscopy with ultrasound has allowed for improved staging of patients with pancreatic cancer and exclusion of patients who are not resectable for cure. We performed laparoscopy with ultrasound on 50 consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas or liver who appeared to have resectable tumors based on preoperative computed tomography. 22 patients (44%) were found to be unresectable because of tumor nodules on the liver and/or peritoneal surfaces or unsuspected distant nodal or liver metastases. The site of disease making the patient unresectable was confirmed by biopsy in each case. Of the 28 remaining patients in whom laparoscopic ultrasound predicted to be resectable for cure, 26 (93%) had all tumor removed. Thus laparoscopy with ultrasound was the best method to select patients for curative surgery. Intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) has been a critical method to identify insulinomas that are not palpable. Nonpalpable tumors are most commonly in the pancreatic head. Because the pancreatic head is thick and insulinomas are small, of 9 pancreatic head insulinomas only 3 (33%) were palpable. However, IOUS precisely identified each (100%). Others have recommended blind distal pancreatectomy for individuals with insulinoma in whom no tumor can be identified. However, our data suggest that this procedure is contraindicated as these occult tumors are usually within the pancreatic head. Recent series suggest that previously missed gastrinomas are commonly in the duodenum. IOUS is not able to identify these tumors, but other methods can. Of 27 patients with 31 duodenal gastrinomas, palpation identified 19 (61%). IOUS did not image a single tumor that was not palpable. Endoscopy with duodenal transillumination found an additional 7 tumors (84%), and duodenotomy identified an additional 5 (100%). Thus duodenotomy (opening the duodenum) is indicated in all patients with gastrinoma as duodenal tumors are missed by other means including ultrasound, palpation and transillumination. In conclusion, laparoscopy with ultrasound is useful for selecting patients with pancreatic cancer for curative surgery. Ultrasound is critical for operative identification of insulinomas especially in the pancreatic head, and duodenotomy can identify duodenal wall gastrinomas that are missed by other methods."
CD009323,0,10436810,0,Essentials in biliopancreatic staging: a decision analysis.,"Two possible strategies for diagnosis and staging of patients with suspected biliopancreatic cancer and obstructive jaundice were tested in a decision analysis. One strategy was called 'surgical' strategy and consisted of only Ultrasonography and (spiral) CT scan and exploratory laparotomy in all patients without irresectable disease or distant metastases according to this work-up. The other strategy was called 'non-surgical' strategy and consisted of the above strategy, but also included ERCP and endoscopic internal drainage (stent) and diagnostic laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound. In the decision analysis incidences of the outcomes after the two strategies were estimated based on the literature and our own experience, and a utility (0-1) was attributed to each separate outcome, according to the expected quality of life as judged by the team. Total utility of each strategy was calculated. It could be concluded that a non-surgical strategy would lead to a somewhat higher total utility in case the yield (i.e. prevention of unnecessary laparotomies) could be high and supposed that a beneficial effect of pre-operative internal biliary drainage was present. In case of low yield of diagnostic laparoscopy the superiority of the 'non-surgical' strategy is doubtful."
CD009323,0,10436804,0,Gallbladder carcinoma.,"Carcinoma of the gallbladder has an unusual geographic and demographic distribution being more common in Israel, Bolivia, Chile and in Southwestern native Americans in the United States. Chronic cholecystitis, choledochal cysts and significantly high body mass index are associated risk factors. Over 90% of gallbladder carcinomas are adenocarcinomas. Advanced local and regional disease usually is present at the time of diagnosis. P53 protein overexpression and p53 mutation may be related to increasing grade of cytologic atypia and to invasiveness. K-ras gene mutation occurs in both dysplasia and carcinomas. Ultrasonography, CT, MRI are diagnostic measures that can provide accurate staging information. Overall, the curative resection rates for gallbladder carcinoma range from 10% to 30%. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, gallbladder cancer may be inadvertently discovered necessitating a more extensive resection. For those with unresectable disease, palliative surgical, endoscopic or radiologic bypass procedures can improve quality of life. Other approaches to the management of advanced tumors include combined radiation and chemotherapy and systemic chemotherapy."
CD009323,0,10436781,0,Laparoscopic staging of biliopancreatic malignancy.,The main benefit of laparoscopic staging (LLU) of (distal) bilio-pancreatic malignancy is the detection of small superficial metastases at the liver surface and peritoneum and local tumor ingrowth. The different aspects of laparoscopic staging have been described extensively in the literature and the benefit is generally expressed in terms of prevention of laparotomy. The impact of this final staging procedure on outcome for the patient in terms of the efficacy of the subsequent non-surgical palliative treatment have been analysed scarsely. In this review the results of laparoscopic staging of bilio-pancreatic tumors concerning the detection of metastases and tumor ingrowth as well as the results of long term follow up after subsequent non-surgical treatment and the preferred palliative treatment after laparoscopic staging are discussed.

Analysis of 18 cases].,"Laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection (APR-L) represents a truly laparoscopic operation which feasibility has been demonstrated by several authors. The wish to offer a minimally invasive procedure to patients that will deal with permanent colostomy was responsible for the authors' initial experience with the method which began in 1992. Hospital charts of patients who underwent APR-L to this date were reviewed and data regarding duration of the operation, intraoperative complications, need for conversion and characteristics of the postoperative period were assessed. Seventeen patients with the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the low rectum and one with squamous carcinoma of the anal canal underwent APR-L in a selective basis. The duration of the procedure was between two and six hours. There were no intraoperative complications. There was one conversion due to a large uterus that impaired pelvic dissection. One patient underwent laparotomy in the postoperative course as result of abdominal distension and incipient pelvic herniation of a small bowel wall through perineal wound. There were no septic complications and mean hospital stay was seven days. Perineal hernia occurring in the late postoperative period was seen in two patients. One of these underwent surgical correction through a conventional approach. Authors conclude that APR-L is feasible with low morbidity. Rectal oncologic dissection through video-laparoscopic access seems to be preserved and the method seems to be superior to the conventional access when considering that there is no need for abdominal incision."
CD009323,0,10434454,0,[Intraoperative echography in biliopancreatic surgery].,"Intraoperative sonography (I.O.S.) with the use of high-frequency probes placed in direct contact with structures in exploration assures a more diagnostic accuracy. I.O.S. is particularly useful in bilio-pancreatic surgery for a more precise diagnostic valuation and an excellent surgical approach. It is fundamental in the lithiasis of the biliary duct, especially hepatic lithiasis, microlithiasis, obstruction of common bile duct of uncertain cause and during laparocholecystectomy. In pancreatic surgery I.O.S. is of great usefulness in the study of acute and chronic pancreatitis and their complications, cysts, pseudocysts and cystic tumors. I.O.S. plays important role both in exocrine pancreatic carcinomas for a correct staging, and resectability decision, and in endocrine functioning tumors, permitting the location of some lesions of little dimension and eventual hormone secreting hepatic or lymph nodal metastases. In laparoscopic mini-invasive surgery, I.O.S. substitutes the palpatory sense of touch in the location and study of anatomic structures, reducing the risks of iatrogenic lesions and allowing, diagnostic accuracy even in some underestimated pathologies."
CD009323,0,10434453,0,[Echography in minimally invasive surgery].,"Thanks to the great development of laparoscopic surgery and his continuous technical evolution, echography plays more and more important role in the pre- and intraoperative diagnosis. In the hepato-pancreatic pathology the use of the laparoscopic echography reduces clearly the role of laparotomic exploration. In laparoscopic surgery of rectal-colon, the echography is more specific and sensitive in compared with pre-operative MR and CT to individualize liver metastasis, to locate them. This allows the treatment of such lesions through the cryosurgery. In pancreatic lesions such method plays a non releasable role in tumors staging, giving essential elements to the surgeon to operate and for a better definition of operative strategy. Also in the adrenal masses surgery, laparoscopic echography reveals very useful especially in the anatomical structures identification (i.e. renal vein and entrance of the left adrenal vein) in the patients already operated or obese. In the preoperative study of rectal tumors the use of rotating and transrectal probes allows to define the degree of infiltration of the lesion and to perform a mini-invasive treatment through endoscopic transanal microsurgery with the radiochemotherapy. Thus echography in mini-invasive surgery has an unreplaceable role both in diagnosis as in evaluation of the parameter of therapeutical approach."
CD009323,0,10434447,0,[Echo-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy in the treatment of acute cholecystitis].,"Ultrasound-guided cholecystostomy (UGC) is indicated for high-risk patients with acute cholecystitis (AC). The advantage of this approach is greatest for critically ill patients who develop AC while in the intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, in ICU patients with unexplained sepsis UGC serves as a diagnostic maneuver since it may allow the identification of a biliary infection. UGC has a high therapeutic efficacy approaching 100% in patients with a well-established diagnosis of AC. Morbidity is low and almost entirely related to catheter dislodgment. Trans-catheter cholecystocholangiograms (TCC), indispensable for planning any further treatment, must be delayed until the resolution of the sepsis. The risk of recurrence depends on AC etiology. Acalculous AC entails a low recurrence risk and may often be managed non-operatively. After the resolution of the sepsis, all calculous AC should be considered for cholecystectomy. However, if the operative risk remains high the possibility of avoiding the operation depends on the TCC demonstration of the patency of the cystic duct. The catheter should remain in place until operation. In case of non-operative management withdrawal should be delayed until the resolution of the sepsis. Laparoscopy is suitable in case of recent inflammation."

Patients without histologically proven metastases proceeded to laparotomy. Metastases were detectable laparoscopically in nine of 49 patients (18.4%) with gastric cancer (peritoneum n = 5, omentum n = 2, liver n = 2). Intraoperatively metastases were evident in further five cases (liver n = 3, peritoneum n = 2). In eleven of 33 patients (33%) with pancreatic cancer metastases were detected by laparoscopy (liver n = 6, peritoneum n = 2, liver and peritoneum n = 3) and in further four patients intraoperatively (liver n = 2, peritoneum n = 2). One of seven patients with an adenocarcinoma of the esophagus had liver metastases detected by laparoscopy. Intraoperatively no metastases were evident in those patients.

It represents a revolution in endocrine surgery equivalent to that observed in general surgery after the first cholecystectomy was performed in 1987. This new approach needs evaluation in terms of feasibility, indications, safety, and surgical procedure to define its potential advantages. The surgical technique and operative approaches of laparoscopic adrenalectomies are at the present time well defined and mostly accepted. Pancreatic approaches and resections, thyroidectomies, and parathyroidectomies are more confidential and performed only by rare teams. Nevertheless, the development of this technique is ineluctable. The spread of this technique, partly due to the increased quality of the technologies available, especially cameras, encounter a major brake that limits its generalization: If general surgeons commonly perform laparoscopy in their daily practice, they treat few patients presenting endocrine disorders. On the other hand, endocrine surgeons to whom many patients are referred do not have regular videoscopic practice. Endocrine surgery benefit few patients for these reasons.

Between 1995 and 1998, 10 patients underwent laparoscopic palliation. In 3 cases laparoscopic double bypass and 7 patients gastroenterostomy was performed, in some instances combined with endoscopic stenting. Postoperative morbidity was 10% for laparoscopic palliation. There was no mortality in laparoscopic bypass surgery. Postoperative hospital stay averaged 11 days. Our preliminary experience strongly suggests that laparoscopic palliation may greatly reduce the three major drawbacks of open bypass surgery, i.e. high morbidity and mortality, and long postoperative hospital stay.

In most cases, cystic duct dilatation over a guide wire was followed by transcystic CBDE with choledochoscopy. Stone extraction was accomplished through a combination of flushing, basket manipulation, fragmentation, retrieval, or advancement of stones through the ampulla. Data were analyzed using SPSS computer software, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. During the period of study there were 1053 laparoscopic cholecystectomies with and without cholangiography and 100 total CBDE performed. Of these, 54/100 had an attempt at laparoscopic CBDE. There were 39 females and 15 males, with a median age of 52 years (range 14-88). Presentation included acute cholecystitis or biliary colic (63%), gallstone pancreatitis (20%), and jaundice or cholangitis (17%). Successful laparoscopic stone removal was achieved in 36 of 54 (67%) cases. Eighteen of the remainder (33%) were converted to an open procedure. Size, number, position of stones, technical difficulties in accessing the common bile duct, and patient factors contributed to open conversion. The rate of successful laparoscopic CBDE improved for each individual surgeon from an average of 22 per cent in the first half of the study period (1991-1994) to 87 per cent in the second half (1995-1997). There was no operative mortality. Significant morbidity in the laparoscopic group included one retained stone and two cases of postoperative pancreatitis. There were three false negative preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography examinations. Multivariate analysis showed that experience of the individual surgeon was the only significant factor predicting successful laparoscopic CBDE. Low initial success rate in the early phase of the study period improved dramatically to reach an overall success rate of 87 per cent in the second half. Laparoscopic management of common bile duct stones is possible in a community setting with a high success rate and minimal morbidity. It precludes excessive use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with its own set of complications but is associated with a significant learning curve. It is currently our preferred therapeutic approach for choledocholithiasis discovered pre- or intraoperatively."
CD009323,0,10398903,0,Current status of laparoscopic surgery of the pancreas.,"Laparoscopic surgery of the pancreas remains, other than for certain clear indications, primarily investigational. However, in the past few years, laparoscopic therapy for pancreatic diseases has made significant strides and will undoubtedly contribute increasingly to the care of the surgical patient with pancreatic disease. This review discusses the current status of minimally invasive surgical therapy of pancreatic diseases and reviews the current literature. There are four major areas of clinical and laboratory investigation, including diagnostic laparoscopy for staging of pancreatic cancer, laparoscopic palliation of unresectable pancreatic cancer, laparoscopic management of pancreatic pseudocyst, and laparoscopic partial pancreatectomy (pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and enucleation for islet cell tumors). The increased sensitivity of staging laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasound as a staging modality in the diagnosis of previously unrecognized metastatic disease from pancreatic cancer is clearly the most utilitarian application of laparoscopic technology in this patient population. Additionally, a natural extension of staging laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasound is the ability to improve the quality of life for the patient with unresectable pancreatic cancer by palliating the biliary and gastrointestinal obstruction and the debilitating pain, without the need for and morbidity of open laparotomy. Laparoscopic internal drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts remains early in its development but appears to have potential benefit from application of minimal access techniques. And laparoscopic partial pancreatectomy, both pancreaticoduodenectomy, and, to a lesser degree, distal pancreatectomy, remain primarily investigational without clearly established benefits from the use of minimal access techniques."
CD009323,0,10390590,0,Laparoscopic visualization of the cystic artery anatomy.,"Uncontrolled bleeding from the cystic artery and its branches is a serious problem that may increase the risk of intraoperative lesions to vital vascular and biliary structures. On laparoscopic visualization anatomic relations are seen differently than during conventional surgery, so proper knowledge of the hepatobiliary triangle anatomic structures under the conditions of laparoscopic visualization is required. We present an original classification of the anatomic variations of the cystic artery into two main groups based on our experience with 200 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, with due consideration of the known anatomicotopographic relations. Group I designates a cystic artery situated within the hepatobiliary triangle on laparoscopic visualization. This group included three types: (1) normally lying cystic artery, found in 147 (73.5%) patients; (2) most common cystic artery variation, manifesting as its doubling, present in 31 (15.5%) patients; and (3) the cystic artery originating from the aberrant right hepatic artery, observed in 11 (5.5%) patients. Group II designates a cystic artery that could not be found within the hepatobiliary triangle on laparoscopic dissection. This group included two types of variation: (1) cystic artery originating from the gastroduodenal artery, found in nine (4. 5%) patients; and (2) cystic artery originating from the left hepatic artery, recorded in two (1%) patients."
CD009323,0,10390588,0,Value of intravenous cholangiography prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"We performed a retrospective study on 163 patients for evaluation of the benefit of intravenous cholangiography prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Radiographic evaluation of the various areas of the biliary system was classified regarding resolution of anatomic structures: well detailed (excellent), impaired image but reliable interpretation possible (good), insufficient contrast with limited assessment (poor), no reliable judgment possible (insufficient). The common bile duct could be described as ""good"" in 96.3%, whereas the cystic duct could be described as ""good"" in only 54.6%. Concrements of the gallbladder were recognized in 72.4%, and common bile duct stones were diagnosed in only two of three patients. A distal junction of the cystic duct was found in nine cases, but there was no influence on the following operative procedure. Only one of two patients with a short cystic duct was identified. We found no improvement after routine use of intravenous cholangiography concerning the evidence of common bile duct stones or the avoidance of lesions of the common bile duct. Hence routine use of intravenous cholangiography prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not justified."
CD009323,0,10374791,0,Diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy for the adult cryptorchid testicle.,"Laparoscopy can be utilized in the management of male patients with impalpable gonads. However, there have been few reports of its application in the management of adult men with cryptorchidism. Fourteen adult men with 15 undescended testicles were referred to our urology department over 6 years. Eight testicles from seven men could not be localized clinically or radiographically to the inguinal canal. Laparoscopy was utilized to assess for the presence and location of the gonad and to perform orchiectomy when testicular tissue was encountered. The average age of the seven men undergoing laparoscopy was 40 years. Three testicles were found proximal to the internal ring and were removed using laparoscopic techniques. The ipsilateral testicular vessels and vas deferens were visualized entering the internal ring in three cases and dense ipsilateral adhesions from previous inguinal surgery prevented adequate visualization of the cord structures in one individual, leading to four inguinal explorations in the same setting. Two inguinal orchiectomies were performed and two vanishing testicles were identified. Gonadal vessels were absent in the remaining patient as demonstrated by extensive laparoscopic dissection. The average total operative time was 105 minutes, which included additional procedures in four patients. No patient experienced an intraoperative or postoperative complication. Six of seven patients were discharged on the day of surgery. An intratesticular germ cell neoplasm was found in one of seven specimens, which stresses the importance of diagnosing and managing this uncommon problem in the adult man."

The English language literature on the subject is reviewed. The most likely predisposing factor is improper or erratic application of clips resulting in bile leakage, either subclinical or overt. Secure and correct placement of clips could help to prevent this complication."

CD009323,0,10359358,0,Patients with laparoscopically staged unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma do not require subsequent surgical biliary or gastric bypass.,"Laparoscopic staging is an effective and accurate means of staging pancreatic cancer. But, the frequency of subsequent surgical bypass to treat biliary or gastric obstruction in laparoscopically staged patients with unresectable adenocarcinoma is unknown. The development of biliary and gastric obstruction in patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma has been reported to occur in as many as 70% and 25% of patients, respectively. Previously, staging for patients with pancreatic cancer was achieved by laparotomy and the anticipated high rate for these patients to develop obstruction led to prophylactic bypass procedures. As laparoscopic staging for pancreatic cancer becomes a standard modality, the need for prophylactic bypass procedures in these patients needs to be examined."

A 2/3 distal Billroth resection was performed in 5 patients, for gastric ulcer (2) and for GIST (3). Other 7 patients were curatively operated on for a malignant disease. Any case was resected by oncosurgical gastrectomy including a D2-lymphadenectomy. The histological diagnoses were an adenocarcinoma in 6 cases, and one highly malignant maltoma. The mean operating time was 230 min in Billroth I resections and 295 min in total gastrectomies. As a complication, we saw postoperatively a duodenal leakage in one case, we could successfully manage also laparoscopically on the day after the operation. All the courses were extremely uncomplicated, connected with rapid mobility, early gut motility, little pain, and a comfortable cosmetic result. The resection result in any case of malignoma was R0, the mean lymphonode amount was 34. Tumour cell dissemination and trokar site metastases we could'nt note either.

A review of the literature retrieved over 200 published cases. Technically, the open laparoscopy procedure seems mandatory to avoid bowel injuries. Grasping the enlarged bowel and using monopolar cautery should be avoided. The surgeon should also be sure that at the end of the procedure adhesiolysis was correct. Evaluation of the results must also take into account that most studies were retrospective and included few patients. The cumulative effectiveness rate of laparoscopy was 60%. Failures were mainly due to multiple adhesions, iatrogenic perforations to the intestine, and colonic cancers not recognized before the procedure. There was no prospective study comparing laparoscopy with laparotomy. Finally, it is not proved at present that laparoscopy prevents the recurrence of adhesions after digestive surgery. Owing to the results of the literature, laparoscopic surgery for acute small bowel obstruction does not appear as based on fact."

CD009323,0,10235352,0,Completely laparoscopic resection of a rare pyloric tumor with laparoscopically sutured gastroduodenostomy.,"We report the case of a 31-year-old woman who presented with epigastric pain and weight loss. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a submucosal mass in the distal antrum and pylorus. Endoscopic biopsy of the mass was nondiagnostic. A CT scan confirmed a 3.0-cm mass in the posterior wall of the distal antrum. She underwent laparoscopic resection of the distal antrum and pylorus with end-to-end gastroduodenostomy. Pathologic examination showed an adenomyoma of the antrum and pylorus. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated, and she continues to do well 38 months postoperatively. Gastric adenomyoma is a rare, benign intramural tumor of the antrum and pylorus. Fewer than 40 cases have been described in the literature. The lesions are generally within 4 cm of the pylorus. Histologically, they are characterized by ductal structures lined by cuboidal to columnar epithelium surrounded by smooth muscle bundles and, occasionally, Brunner's-type glands and heterotopic pancreas. Treatment is by resection, and recurrence has not been reported. Laparoscopic resection of portions of the stomach has been reported. Side-to-side gastrojejunostomies (Billroth II) performed laparoscopically have been reported. This is the first report in the English-language literature of a completely laparoscopically performed sutured gastroduodenostomy. Technical details of the procedure and adenomyomas are discussed."

In 19 patients with choledocholithiasis and a common bile duct of > or = 2 cm, and in 6 cases of obstructive jaundice secondary to advanced unresectable pancreatic neoplasms, the technique produced good results as a permanent solution to the life-threatening problem of common bile duct obstruction.

CD009323,0,10235083,0,[Role of endoscopy in the palliative therapy of pancreatic cancer].,"The incidence of pancreatic cancer continues to increase and, although improving of diagnostic techniques, the prognosis is very poor with 5-year survival less than 5% and high mortality cancer rate. Neural and lymphatic micrometastases appear in early stages and curative resection is possible in few selected cases; in these patients there is a high local recurrence rate and a low median survival. Most patients with pancreatic cancer need palliative care of the obstructive jaundice (90%), duodenal stenosis and abdominal pain; endoscopic procedures have an important role in the treatment of these patients. Endoscopic placement of plastic biliary stents is a safe and efficient technique to perform a biliary drainage with a short hospital stay. The use of metal stent, instead of plastic prosthesis, improve median patency of the prosthesis with a low incidence of cholangitis, but they should be used only in patients with a life expectancy of more than six months, because of their high costs. Laparoscopic gastro-entero-anastomosis is a valid alternative to laparotomic procedure in the treatment of the duodenal stenosis, with a shorter hospital stay and a lower morbidity rate. The endoscopic treatment of abdominal pain with pancreatic endoprosthesis placement or with endosonography-guided celiac plexus neurolysis is an alternative approach to radiotherapy and analgesic drugs."
CD009323,0,10235074,0,[Endoscopy in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer].,"Pancreatic carcinoma is the fourth cause of death for cancer in the USA, carrying a dismal prognosis and poor overall survival. Unfortunately, resection for cure is feasible in a limited number of patients, thus confirming the need for an early diagnosis and accurate preoperative staging to select patients potentially resectable from those candidates to palliative treatment. Among imaging modalities, endoscopic procedures (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, laparoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography) play a key role in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic tumors. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) allows direct visualization of the main pancreatic duct and its side branches with their morphologic alterations, which are present in most cases of pancreatic cancer. The method is very sensitive in experienced hands, with diagnostic accuracy over 95%. The most common finding in pancreatic cancer is the stricture of the pancreatic duct, the bile duct, or both. Moreover, ductal brush cytology and K-ras mutation analysis can be performed during ERCP, possibly improving the diagnostic accuracy of the technique. Diagnostic laparoscopy provides detection of small (< 1 cm) liver metastases and peritoneal implants of tumor which cannot be visualized by any other imaging modality, with the possibility to biopsy under direct vision suspicious areas or to perform peritoneal lavage. The adjunct of laparoscopic ultrasound improves the staging capabilities of the technique for pancreatic cancer (retroperitoneal spread, vascular invasion). Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is able to produce great detail of the pancreatic parenchyma and regional lymph nodes. It is especially sensitive in the detection of small pancreatic masses which cannot be imaged with other modalities. EUS has the additional advantage of directing transduodenal fine-needle aspiration biopsies. Presently it is the most sensitive technique for the diagnosis and locoregional staging of pancreatic cancer, but limits have been identified in the lack of specificity (differentiation between malignant tumor and focal pancreatitis) and its operator-dependency. Reported is our experience with EUS in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. Over a seven-year period 43 patients with pancreatic tumors were staged with EUS preoperatively. Twenty-two patients were submitted to surgery at our Institution and EUS findings were compared with results of pathology or surgical exploration. EUS provided sensitivity of 100% for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, while its accuracy for staging tumor infiltration, lymph node involvement and vascular invasion was 86.4%, 69.2% and 77.8%, respectively. Despite improvements in the noninvasive imaging modalities, endoscopic techniques are likely to remain established methods for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. EUS with fine-needle aspiration biopsy is probably the most promising, followed by laparoscopy (and laparoscopic ultrasound) which is essential to rule out small peritoneal implants and liver metastasis."
CD009323,0,10235073,0,[Ultrasonography of pancreatic neoplasms].,"Pancreatic tumors are the fourth cause of death in Occident: the 5-year-survival rate is less than 5% because of diagnostic difficulties, low clinical expression at early stage, and complexity of the surgical treatment. The role of ultrasound (US) is in early diagnosis, because also in early cancer there could be lymphatic spread or peritoneal involvement. There are multiple modalities to study the pancreas with US: abdominal US, ""contact"" US (endosonography and intra-operative or laparoscopic US). The first is not invasive, cheap but limited by extrinsic and intrinsic factors, the latter are respectively characterized by high cost, and need of endoscopic specialists for endosonography, the complementarity to laparoscopy or surgery for the laparoscopic/intraoperative US. Abdominal US is the first diagnostic step for the pancreas, but it is not affordable in 15-25% of patients, because of meteorism. In all the other cases, it represents the pancreas with a good contrast between the normal parenchyma and tumoral tissues. Abdominal US, together with biopsy, can define the resectability. Ecoendoscopy is actually dedicated to small tumors staging, but recent studies demonstrate the same results achieved by spiral TC. Laparoscopic US is a second step imaging in patients already selected for surgery. The first finality in US evaluation of tumor masses is early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer; it can give to some of these patients the opportunity of undergoing to surgical treatment. This could be achieved by a proper use of the moititude of ultrasonic abdominal explorations that are requested in daily practice. US, together with CT and MR, can define the resectability of the tumor, with further supplementar evaluation by mean of laparoscopic US. Intraoperative US is now indicated for planning and guiding the surgeon in resection of the pancreatic cancer."

CD009323,0,10227930,0,"Jejunostomy: techniques, indications, and complications.","Jejunostomy is a surgical procedure by which a tube is situated in the lumen of the proximal jejunum, primarily to administer nutrition. There are many techniques used for jejunostomy: longitudinal Witzel, transverse Witzel, open gastrojejunostomy, needle catheter technique, percutaneous endoscopy, and laparoscopy. The principal indication for a jejunostomy is as an additional procedure during major surgery of the upper digestive tract, where irrespective of the pathology or surgical procedures of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, liver, and biliary tracts, nutrition can be infused at the level of the jejunum. It is also used in laparotomy patients in whom a complicated postoperatory recovery is expected, those with a prolonged fasting period, those in a hypercatabolic state, or those who will subsequently need chemotherapy or radiotherapy. As a sole procedure it is advised for neurologic and congenital illnesses, in geriatric patients who pose difficult care demands, and for patients with tumors of the head and neck. The complications seen with jejunostomy can be mechanical, infectious, gastrointestinal, or metabolic. The rate of technical complications of the Witzel longitudinal technique is 2.1%, for the transverse Witzel up to 6.6%, for the Roux-en-Y 21%, for open gastrojejunostomy from 2%, and for the needle catheter technique from 1.5% with 0.14% mortality. The percutaneous endoscopic procedures have as much as a 12% complication rate; no figures exist for laparoscopy. The complications are moderate and severe: tube dislocation, obstruction or migration of the tube, cutaneous or intraabdominal abscesses, enterocutaneous fistulas, pneumatosis, occlusion, and intestinal ischemia. The infectious complications are aspiration pneumonia and contamination of the diet. The gastrointestinal complications are diarrhea 2.3% to 6.8%, abdominal distension, colic, constipation, nausea, and vomiting. The metabolic complications are hyperglycemia 29%, hypokalemia 50%, water and electrolyte imbalance, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia. These complications are secondary to inadequate selection of nutrition relative to the characteristics of the patient, to inadequate management of the mixture, and to deficient clinical care. The ideal jejunostomy technique depends on the material resources but more importantly on the experience of the surgeon. The benefits of jejunostomy justify the risks."

Treatment options include surgical enucleation, open or laparoscopic unroofing or percutaneous emptying usually associated with injection of sclerotising agent. From May 1995 to June 1997 10 patients with single, symptomatic, non-parasitic cysts of the liver were treated at the 2nd Department of General Surgery, Collegium Medicum of Jagiellonian University. Ultrasound and gastroscopy excluded other pathology of upper GI tract that might be responsible for the symptoms. Under ultrasound guidance samples of cysts content were collected for cytology, bilirubin concentration and bacteriology. Injection of the contrast medium revealed no contact of the cyst's cavity with the biliary tree. 5 patients were excluded from the protocol due to leakage of contrast in to fee peritoneal cavity. Other 5 were submitted to sclerotherapy by injection of 95% ethanol after introduction of fine drain into the cyst's cavity under ultrasound guidance; in two patients procedure was performed once, in two twice and in one tree times. In 4 patients complete or nearly complete resolution of symptoms was achieved, in one with big cyst treatment failed. We observed no complication. Owing to satisfying results we may conclude that this minimally invasive method might be attempted before more aggressive treatment would be employed."

We investigated whether 3D-CT cholangiography could provide a useful image, for preoperative examination in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Sixty-five patients with biliary diseases were examined by 3D-CT cholangiography. Helical scanning was performed on a Proceed Accell (GE Medical Systems, Waukesha, WI, USA). Three-dimensional images were created using an independent workstation. A clear image of the common bile duct was obtained for all patients (100%) by 3D-CT cholangiography. The gallbladder was well visualized in 54 (93%) and the cystic duct was shown to be opacified in 55 (95%) of the 58 patients with a gallbladder. Thirty-one patients were diagnosed as having gallstones by 3D-CT cholangiography (sensitivity. 72.1%; specificity, 100%; accuracy, 79.3%), while 43 were diagnosed as having cholecystolithiasis by ultrasonography. The advantages of 3D-CT cholangiography were a low level of invasiveness, easily obtained images compared to those obtained with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC), good opacification, and provision of a three-dimensional understanding of the biliary system, especially of the cystic duct. When combined with ultrasonography and routine liver function tests, 3D-CT cholangiography was considered very useful for obtaining information before laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It allowed the omission of ERC in many patients who were considered to have no common bile duct stone, by employment of 3D-CT cholangiography."

CD009323,0,10083930,0,Ultrasound guidance during endoscopic procedures.,"The use of laparoscopic ultrasound probes has been shown to improve outcomes and facilitate surgery for hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers. It is a useful, inexpensive, and safe imaging technique that should also supplement operative laparoscopy for gynecologic indications. These techniques are new, and their use in gynecologic surgery has not been adequately evaluated to recommend widespread use. The principal benefit of ultrasound monitoring during operative laparoscopy is its potential impact on operative management and decision making. Theoretically, the intentions would be to reduce the amount of tissue dissection, for example, by more precisely locating an ovarian endometrioma; to reduce operating time; and to monitor more closely intrauterine procedures. Further prospective randomized studies are needed to define the exact role of ultrasound monitoring in gynecologic surgery. An exciting possibility is its use to define intraovarian anatomy more definitively in the hope of minimizing the amount of ovarian dissection and, in select circumstances, guiding further intrauterine surgery. With the use of steerable probes, an assessment could be made of the pelvic side wall in oncologic surgery to select specifically nodes that are highly suspicious for malignancies, thereby minimizing the amount of dissection necessary in staging procedures. Intraoperative ultrasound guidance in intrauterine endoscopic procedures offers a noninvasive means of assessing the precision of such procedures and provides information regarding the exact location of instruments within the uterine cavity and uterine wall. It has been used for almost 15 years, and adequate clinical experience has been accrued. It offers an alternative to more invasive laparoscopy and may be considered as an adjunct to any complicated intrauterine procedure."

This condition probably derives from the precocious appearance of pain or jaundice during choledocal pathology respects to the asymptomatic gallbladder localization. Moreover, using morphological indicators of intracholecistic ultrasonography, the gallbladder's polypoid lesions are divided in group s and for each of the m are indicate d most/actual curative criteria. Currently tendency is to check periodically gallbladder polypoid lesions, and to recure to surgery when the lesion result large more than 1 cm, single, associated with stones, when the patient is older than 50 years and when there is a clear clinical symptomatology.

CD009323,0,10030860,0,Endoluminal surgery.,"The development of laparoscopic surgery has provided minimally invasive surgeons with advanced laparoscopic instrumentation and high definition imaging. The resulting surgical expertise and technology has now been extended to gastric endoluminal surgery. Laboratory and clinical investigations have been initiated for various applications of this new form of surgery. Endoluminal gastric wall excision surgery is the most widely utilized and includes the removal of superficial gastric malignancies, benign gastric wall leiomyomas, and gastric polyps. Clinical experience has increased, and the initial results have been satisfactory. Pancreaticocystogastrostomy can be successfully performed using intraluminal surgery, but gastric wall bleeding and lack of fusion of the stomach to the cyst wall have complicated some cases. There are case reports of foreign body removal and intraluminal surgical procedures for patients with bleeding gastric ulcers. Of primary importance at this stage of development is the surgeon's familiarity with appropriate indications for gastric endoluminal surgery and the access devices currently available. Future considerations include the application of this approach to patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, occult gastrointestinal bleeding, intractable bleeding from a duodenal ulcer, and multiinstitutional trials of gastric excision procedures."

This 69-year-old man was admitted with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. After LC was performed, intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) revealed no abnormal findings. However, postoperatively, bilious material began to appear from the intraabdominal drain. Subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed bile leakage from the end of the cystic duct stump. ENBD was performed. Cholangiography using the ENBD tube 14 days later failed to show a bile leak. The ENBD was subsequently removed. The patient improved rapidly with no complaints. Bile leakage due to clip displacement from the cystic duct stump is a potential pitfall of LC, especially if IOC is normal. We recommend careful cystic duct ligation, combined with the use of superior quality ligation clips, to prevent this complication. ENBD is a useful technique to prevent bile leakage after this complication."
CD009323,0,9918627,0,Laparoscopic intracorporeal ultrasound cystic duct length measurement: a new technique to prevent common bile duct injuries.,"The incidence of common bile duct injury remains high. Intracorporeal ultrasound mapping of cystic duct anatomy, prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), may assist surgeons in avoiding common bile duct injuries. A technique for intraoperative intracorporeal predissection ultrasound imaging (IIPUI) of the cystic duct length was tested. During LC, gallbladder adhesions were lysed, and with the gallbladder retracted by grasping forceps, the ultrasound examination was performed. Using a 7.5-MHz articulating ultrasound probe, visualization of the extrahepatic biliary tree was obtained in five separate planes. Success in visualizing each plane, time for ultrasound examination, and predissection accuracy of cystic duct length measurement were recorded. Intraoperative cholangiography or direct measurement of the dissected cystic duct was used to determine accuracy of the ultrasound cystic duct length estimates. Forty-three patients underwent IIPUI during LC. The time required to perform the examination varied, with a range of 5 to 17 min (mean 9.5 min). Success of visualization in planes 1 through 5 was 44%, 95%, 98%, 98%, and 70%, respectively. The accuracy rate for cystic duct length ultrasound measurement was 87.1%. No complications related to the examination were observed. In this preliminary study, cystic duct length was determined by predissection intracorporeal ultrasound with a high level of accuracy. Predissection imaging may assist in preventing common bile duct injury during LC."

The procedure was successful in 119 patients. In 6 patients fourth port was used, and in another 5, the procedure was converted to open laparo-tomy. Cooperative manipulation of the surgical instruments between the operator and assistant is very important for this procedure, for exposing Calot's triangle and dissecting the gallbladder from the gallbladder bed. The use of an ultrasonic aspiration system (Sumisonic ME 2400; Sumitomo Bakelite, Tokyo, Japan) made it easier to identify the cystic duct and artery, especially in patients with chronic inflammation or dense adhesions. We encountered no problems with cannulation into the cystic duct for intraoperative cholangiography, and there were no intra- and postoperative complications in this series. We achieved good results, similar to those achieved with the four-port technique. This technique is technically feasible and safe, and it has esthetic and cost advantages compared with the four-port technique.

The safety and efficacy of this mini-LC were assessed. Fifty consecutive mini-LCs were performed using one 10-mm port and three 2-mm ports (cumulative port size 16 mm). A 2-mm fiberoptic video-laparoscope was placed in the mid-epigastrium through a 2-mm port. A 10-mm umbilical port was then placed under direct visualization, allowing access for standard laparoscopic instruments. Two additional 2-mm ports were placed in the right upper quadrant allowing insertion of grasping instruments. Parameters reviewed included total operative time (OT), postoperative length of stay (LOS), anatomic pathology, complications, and rate of conversion to conventional LC and open cholecystectomy. Results were compared to those of 50 consecutive conventional LCs using two 10-mm and two 5-mm ports (cumulative port size 30 mm). The OT for the mini-LC and conventional LC were 88 +/- 5.9 and 78 +/- 5 minutes (mean +/- SD), respectively, (p = NS), and postoperative LOS for the mini-LC and conventional LC were 1.5 +/- 0. 2 and 1.8 +/- 0.4 days (mean +/- SD), respectively, (p = NS). Of the 50 mini-LC cases, 5 required conversion to conventional LC. One cystic duct leak was detected and successfully treated conservatively; no common bile duct injuries occurred; and no patients required conversion to open cholecystectomy. This study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of minilaparoscopic instruments for the performance of cholecystectomy. The data reveal that this new technique is comparable to conventional LC."

CD009323,0,9869694,0,A new technique for laparoscopic resection of a submucosal tumor on the posterior wall of the gastric fundus.,"Several reports have been published which describe the technique of using an Endo GIA to resect submucosal tumors on the anterior wall of the stomach. Lesions on the posterior wall, however, especially near the esophagocardiac junction (ECJ), are difficult to resect using these reported techniques. This is because the surgeon must divide the omentum and enter the omental bursa in order to use a similar extraluminal technique. Furthermore, special care must be taken to ensure that resections do not involve the ECJ and narrow the esophagus. In order to overcome these difficulties, we have proposed a new technique for the laparoscopic excision of a submucosal tumor located on the posterior wall of the gastric fundus. The principle of this procedure involves the intraluminal resection of the submucosal tumor, including the surrounding stomach wall, using the Endo GIA. This technique is safe, simple, and effective. We believe that we are the first to address the excision of a submucosal lesion by resecting the full thickness of the posterior gastric wall lesion intraluminally."

CD009323,0,9866770,0,"Causes, clinical features and non-operative management of bile leaks.","This paper evaluates the management of 31 patients with bile leaks identified over a 7-year period. Leaks complicated cholecystectomy in 19 patients (11 laparoscopic, 8 open), interventional procedures in 10 (including surgery in 1), trauma in one and was spontaneous in one case. Confirmation of the diagnosis typically lagged behind the onset of symptoms (mean for the group 4.2 days), indicating that a high index of suspicion is required in at-risk patients with typical symptoms. These include abdominal pain or distension, fever, bile leaking along a drain, jaundice, abnormal liver function tests and elevated white cell count. Two post-surgical bile leaks required surgical drainage of abdominal cellections. The remainder were successfully managed by non-operative methods including percutaneous drainage, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography with or without sphincterotomy or stent placement and percutaneous stenting. The spontaneous leak and all bile leaks complicating interventional procedures were managed non-operatively, although six patients in this group died due to the underlying malignant pathology. Only the patient with self-inflicted transection of the bile duct died directly from the complications of the bile leak. Although this is a varied, small series, we conclude that the majority of bile leaks can be managed by non-operative techniques. Whilst endoscopy is the primary modality for treatment, percutaneous techniques are crucially important for the management of complex cases and endoscopic failure."

The patients were divided in to three groups. 28 patients of group 1 had duration of jaundice up to 5 days and bilirubinemia up to 86.3 +/- 3.12 mmol/l. 35 patients of group 2 jaundice up to 15 days and bilirubinemia up to 184.7 +/- 4.22 mmol/l. In group 342 patients had bilirubinemia up to 124.4 +/- 2.23 mmol/l and cholangitis. External decompression of bile ducts quickly promotes restoration of drainage function of the liver and normalization of biochemical indexes. Restoration of immunological indexes in groups 2 and 3 is progressing slowly and demands immunocorrection. Indexes of immunoreactivity and biochemical data of functional status of the liver could serve as criteria of effectiveness of bile ducts decompression and possibility of radical surgical treatment.

A laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasonogram demonstrated a solitary hypoechogenic tumor in the pancreatic tail. After the tail and body of the pancreas with the spleen were mobilized, laparoscopic enucleation was performed without any complications. The total operative time was 225min and the estimated blood loss was 20 ml. Serial blood sugar measurements demonstrated a sharp rise in blood sugar levels at the time of enucleation. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. She has remained well for 33 months following surgery without any hypoglycemic symptoms."

CD009323,0,9843606,0,Trends in bile duct injuries from laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Bile duct injuries are a serious complication of cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LC) were originally associated with an increased incidence of injuries. Patients referred to a tertiary center were reviewed to assess the trends in the number, presentation, and management. Seventy-three patients were referred over a 6-year period with a maximum of 17 patients referred in 1992, but the number has not declined substantially over time. The persistent number of referrals is a consequence of ongoing injuries. One third of injuries were diagnosed at LC, and the use of cholangiography has not increased. The number of cystic duct leaks has not decreased and they represent 25% of all cases. The level of injury has remained unchanged with Bismuth types I and II in 37% and types III and IV in 38%. Excluding patients with cystic duct leaks, 58% were referred after a failed ductal repair. Definitive treatment with biliary stenting was successful in 37%, and 34 patients (47%) required a biliary-enteric anastomosis. Complications occurred in 18 patients (25%) including seven with postoperative stricture or cholangitis. No biliary reoperations have been performed at a mean follow-up of 36 months."

CD009323,0,9841968,0,The utility of intracorporeal ultrasonography for screening of the bile duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Different strategies and imaging modalities have been used to detect common bile duct (CBD) stones during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We prospectively compared fluoroscopic intraoperative cholangiography (FIOC) and laparoscopic intracorporcal ultrasonography (LICU) in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystcctomy for this purpose. In a consecutive series of 607 laparoscopic cholecystectomics, FIOC was used in the first 407 patients, whereas LICU was preferentially applied to the subsequent 200 patients. When LICU documented CBD stones, the duct was flushed with saline solution after intravenous administration of glucagon, and stone persistence or absence was confirmed by FIOC and/or repeat LICU. In the FIOC group, 10 patients were converted to open cholecystectomy and 16 patients did not undergo FIOC. Among the remaining 381 patients, FIOC was successful in 370 (97%). In the LICU group, two patients were converted and LICU was not performed in 26 patients. In the remaining 172 patients, the cystic duct (CBD) junction and the CBD were visualized in all cases (P <0.05 vs. FIOC). The mean (+/- SEM) times required to complete FIOC and LICU were 15. 1 +/- 0.4 minutes and 5.3 +/- 0.2 minutes, respectively (P <0.0001). Choledocholithiasis was detected in 25 patients (7%) undergoing FIOC and in 22 patients (13%) undergoing LICU (P <0.05). In the LICU group, the mean sizes of the stones cleared by ampullary dilatation and flushing (17 of 22, 77%) and those requiring more invasive methods (5 of 22, 23%) were 1.6 +/- 0.2 mm and 2.7 +/- 0.3 mm, respectively (P <0.01). Sludge seen in the CBD by LICU in 10 patients (6%), which disappeared with flushing in all cases. LICU is accurate, safe, and permits more rapid evaluation of bile duct stones than FIOC during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. LICU may be overly sensitive in detecting small stones and sludge, which are of questionable significance. Stones 2 mm or less can usually be cleared by flushing, whereas larger ones often require invasive techniques for removal."

This lesion is extremely rare, with only 33 cases previously reported. The splenic tumor was preoperatively diagnosed as a hemangioma by the combined modalities of ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. A laparoscopic splenectomy was, thus, performed in order to make a final diagnosis. Pathological examination of the mass revealed an inflammatory process. Based on the above findings, a laparoscopic splenectomy is recommended when the tumor is suspected to be benign."
CD009323,0,9840091,0,Heterotopic gastric mucosa in a gallbladder with an anomalous union of the pancreatobiliary duct: a case report.,"A 25 year-old woman experienced a sudden onset of epigastralgia with nausea, and consulted our hospital. Because the abdominal pain did not subside with medication, she was hospitalized. On physical examination she had a slight tenderness of the right upper abdominal quadrant. Laboratory studies disclosed increases in the serum alkaline phosphatase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase, and serum amylase levels. Abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed choledocholithiasis and a pancreatic duct which originated from the common bile duct. A common bile duct stone was removed with a basket catheter after an endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed. Since an anomalous union of a pancreatobiliary duct is a high risk factor of gallbladder cancer, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was perfomed. The post-operative course was uneventful and she was discharged on the twentieth post-operative day. In a microscopical examination of the resected specimen, a pyloric type gastric mucosa was clearly evident in the submucosa, while the remaining gallbladder demonstrated chronic cholecystitis. Some cases of heterotopic gastric mucosa in the gallbladder come from metaplasia, and metaplasia is also one of the most important factors in the carcinogenesis of gallbladder cancer. In conclusion, the present case is the first report of gastric mucosa with an anomalous union of the pancreatobiliary duct. Heterotopic gastric mucosa in the gallbladder may be one of the causes of gallbladder cancer, and close attention should, therefore, be paid to any occurrence of heterotopic gastric mucosa in this region."

In this series, despite a sporadic use of intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), there were no lesions of main biliary tract and there was only a biliary leaking cystic duct resolved with conservative treatment. The authors are satisfied with selective use of endoscopic cholangiography and sphincterotomy for the management of choledocholithiasis, and conclude that the use of IOC is not so essential to avoid iatrogenic lesions of main biliary tract, that could be avoid by applying a meticulous operative technique."
CD009323,0,9834408,0,Laparoscopic management of small bowel obstruction: indications and outcome.,"Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility of a laparoscopic, minimal access approach for the management of patients with small bowel obstruction. Forty patients underwent laparoscopic treatment of radiologically documented or suspected small bowel obstruction based on history and/or motility study. None had chronic abdominal or pelvic pain. The operation was completed laparoscopically in 14 patients (35%) and with laparoscopic-assisted procedures in 12 (30%); 14 (35%) required conversion to open celiotomy because of dense adhesions (precluding complete inspection or adhesiolysis), small bowel necrosis in the setting of small bowel obstruction, or neoplasia. Three iatrogenic enterotomies occurred while ""running"" the bowel. There were three (7%) postoperative procedure-related complications (wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess, ileus). The combined group of patients treated laparoscopically or with laparoscopic-assisted procedures had a shorter hospital stay than those converted to open celiotomy (4 +/- 0.6 vs. 7 +/- 0.7 days; P <0.003). At median follow-up of 12 months, 21 of 26 patients managed laparoscopically or with laparoscopic-assisted procedures remain asymptomatic; all 21 patients with an operatively confirmed site of mechanical obstruction managed by a minimal access approach remain asymptomatic. Laparoscopic treatment of small bowel obstruction is effective, leads to a shorter hospital stay, and has good long-term results. A minimal access approach to treatment of small bowel obstruction should be considered in selected patients."

IOUS provides remarkable benefits in acquisition of accurate diagnostic information, particularly in tumor staging and resectability, and thereby in intraoperative decision making during hepatobiliary, pancreatic, and endocrine surgery. In addition, various surgical procedures are guided or assisted by IOUS. A latest modality of IOUS is LUS, which can provide similar valuable information and compensate for the limitation of laparoscopy. LUS will demonstrate great promise as an adjunct to laparoscopic exploration or surgery."

CD009323,0,9822475,0,New retraction technique to allow better visualization of Calot's triangle during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Bile duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) are thought to occur because surgeons tend to confuse the common bile duct (CBD) with the cystic duct. Among reasons for this misidentification, the difference in the way the operating field is exposed in LC compared to open cholecystectomy should be noticed. Using Dr. Reddick's technique, which is commonly practiced, the upward and the lateral traction of the gallbladder results in a narrower Calot's triangle and angulation of the CBD. These anatomical distortions are thought to contribute to ductal injuries during LC."

CD009323,0,9805800,0,[Cholecystectomy using a minilaparotomy].,"Recent randomized studies have shown that laparoscopic cholecystectomy has little or even no advantage when compared to minilaparotomy cholecystectomy. The authors report the results of a prospective study of minilaparotomy performed at Dahr el Bacheq governmental hospital where laparoscopic equipment was not available. From July 1994 to July 1997 minilaparotomy cholecystectomy was performed on one hundred consecutive patients (75 women and 25 men with an age varying between 26 and 93 years). However, the cholecystectomy could be accomplished through the mini-incision in only 88 cases. Lengthening of the incision was necessary in 12 cases: common duct stones (8 cases), cancer (2 cases), cholecystoduodenal fistula (2 cases). Intraoperative cholangiography was not performed in 3 cases: very thin cystic duct (2 cases), technical problem (1 case). Two patients operated for acute cholecystitis had wound infection. Postoperative course of the 88 completed minilaparotomy cholecystectomies was uneventful: no mortality, no biliary complications, little pain with low analgesia requirement, oral intake on day 1, discharge from hospital on day 2, return to normal activity between day 8 and day 14. Results of minilaparotomy cholecystectomy compare favorably with those of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It should be an alternative to laparoscopic cholecystectomy especially when cost is a problem or when laparoscopic equipment is not available and an alternative to conventional open cholecystectomy in the case of contraindication to laparoscopic cholecystectomy."

CD009323,0,9799149,0,Video-laparoscopic treatment of a sizeable cyst of the cystic duct: a case report.,"A case of cystic dilation isolated from the cystic duct is described. The patient showed symptoms of chronic calculous cholecystitis; the ultrasonographic examination confirmed the clinical hypothesis and showed a 1.3-cm calculus impacted in the infundibulum of the gallbladder. The hepatic and biliary functions were normal. During surgery, the routine cholangiographic study showed a sizable cyst in the cystic canal, as well as an anomalous duct uniting the cyst to the right hepatic duct. As for the rest of the extrahepatic biliary canal, as well as the intrahepatic canal, nothing abnormal was noticed. The videolaparoscopic treatment consisted of a ligature with a clip of the cystic duct and the anomalous duct plus en bloc resection of the cyst and the gallbladder. Histopathologic study showed it to be a benign cyst and chronic calculous cholecystitis. It is important to establish the site of the cyst precisely before surgery, as the procedure should include its resection, since it could be the source of infection or development of lithiasis and even malignant degeneration. There are two hypotheses for the appearance of cysts in the biliary tract: congenital, due to a flaw in the multiplication of the cells that will form the biliary tract during the fetal life, and by aggression by pancreatic juice flowing back to the main biliary canal. The congenital origin seems to be the hypothesis that better explains the appearance of the cyst in the case described here, considering that the backflow of the pancreatic juice could hardly have occurred because of the anatomy as observed: the nonexistence of the common biliary-pancreatic canal and the valvular mechanism, present in the cystic canal, between the cyst itself and the confluence of the cystic canal into the main biliary canal, in addition to the anomalous biliary canal communicating the cyst to the right intrahepatic canal."
CD009323,0,9799138,0,Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy in the palliation of pancreatic cancer: reflections on the preliminary results.,"The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of laparoscopic gastroenteric and cholecystenteric bypass procedures for palliation of inoperable cancer of the pancreas. Between July 1994 and January 1996, five patients underwent laparoscopic gastroenterostomy for duodenal obstruction due to pancreatic cancer. There were four men and one woman, ranging in age from 53 to 72 years (median 63). Four patients already had endoscopic biliary decompression. One patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy for biliary obstruction at the time of the laparoscopic gastroenterostomy. The procedure was completed laparoscopically in all patients. There was no perioperative mortality, and the morbidity was low. The median post-operative stay was 4 days (range, 4-6). Laparoscopic gastroenterostomy associated with cholecystojejunostomy in selected cases offers a less invasive alternative than open surgery, with a shorter hospital stay and more rapid return to normal activity."
CD009323,0,9792898,0,The role of laparoscopy in the management of pancreatic cancer.,"Video laparoscopy has undergone significant advancements in the past several years. This technology can be applied to the management of patients with pancreatic carcinoma. Laparoscopy can be used to achieve the following goals when treating patients with pancreatic cancer: (1) to accurately stage the disease including diagnosis of intraperitoneal and extrapancreatic disease, (2) to evaluate resectability, (3) in resectional therapy and, (4) in palliation of unresectable disease. This chapter reviews in detail these four applications of the laparoscopic surgical approach in the management of patients with pancreatic carcinoma."
CD009323,0,9792897,0,Surgical therapy of pancreatic cancer.,Surgical resection remains the only curative modality for pancreatic cancer. Improvements in surgical technique have greatly reduced the morbidity and mortality from pancreatic resection. These results clearly justify the use of pancreatic resection for localized and resectable pancreatic cancer. New surgical techniques such as laparoscopy can aid in the proper selection of candidates for curative resection. Integration of surgery with more effective treatments to prevent systemic relapse are needed to further improve survival.
CD009323,0,9791991,0,[Choice of optimal policy for treatment of acute pancreatitis].,"662 case records of patients with acute pancreatitis are analysed and principles for the choice of optimal treatment of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) are established. The most justified policy in treatment of AD patients seems to be conservative-expectant. The treatment should satisfy the phases of the course of acute pancreatitis and severity of the disease. At the first stage of the disease the treatment should be aimed at correction of pancreatic toxemia and prophylaxis of pyogenic complications. Surgical interventions at this phase are risky and hardly justified. If there are indications for drainage, laparoscopy and small invasive interventions under US control are preferable. At the second stage conservative-expectant policy should be also used as a method of choice, and treatment should be aimed at prophylaxis of purulent complications. The presence of aseptic necroses are not an absolute indication for surgery if there are no clear signs of suppuration. The presence of purulent complications is an indication for surgical treatment; extraperitoneal approaches to pyogenous areas and their drainage by wide two-lumen tubes for the following use of aspiration--lavage treatment are more preferable."

The laparoscopic approach allows early discharge from the hospital with minimal incisional pain, both of which are highly beneficial to patients with limited lifespan."
CD009323,0,9787204,0,Laparoscopic choledochoenterostomy.,"The modern biliary surgeon must deal with laparoscopic procedures as part of his or her daily routine. Almost all barriers to laparoscopic cholecystectomy have been erased, and more and more surgeons are approaching common bile duct problems from a new viewpoint. Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration is being advocated by many more surgeons than in the past. Bypass of the biliary tract for benign and malignant disease has always been the purvue of biliary tract surgeons, and the transition from open to laparoscopic techniques is an achievable goal and is primarily a function of imagination, planning, and the ability to suture."
CD009323,0,9787203,0,Laparoscopic pancreatic resections.,"Current experience with laparoscopic pancreatic resections based on the reported literature and our own experience is reviewed and indications and preoperative work-up. The technical aspects of laparoscopic pancreatic resections are described with particular reference to 70% to 80% distal pancreatectomy with en block splenectomy. The experience with distal laparoscopic pancreatic resections has been entirely favorable, with benefit to the patient in terms of postoperative recovery, minimal morbidity, and short hospital stay. Case selection is important. These operations should only be attempted by surgeons who have experience in open pancreatic surgery and who have acquired the necessary advanced laparoscopic skills. A team of two experienced surgeons who are used to working together best conducts laparoscopic pancreatic resections. The use of strategic rest breaks with desufflation of the pneumoperitoneum halfway through the surgery is recommended to prevent fatigue and to protect the patient from prolonged periods of positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum. Laparoscopic segmental pancreatic resections with or without splenic preservation should be differentiated from laparoscopic enucleation of islet cell tumors. Both benefit from the use of laparoscopic contact ultrasonography. The most common postoperative complication after laparoscopic pancreatic resection and enucleation is pancreatic fistula. The incidence of this complication may be reduced by suture closure of the transected pancreatic duct and application of fibrin glue. By contrast, our limited experience with laparoscopic pancreatico-duodenectomy has been unfavorable. With the current technology, the laparoscopic approach for this procedure is too prolonged and does not seem to offer any benefit to the patient. Its use cannot be recommended."

The use of laparoscopy and LUS in diagnosis, staging, palliation, and treatment of intra-abdominal malignancies is discussed, with a focus on the literature and our own experience."
CD009323,0,9779627,0,Laparoscopic evaluation in pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer continues to carry a poor overall prognosis. The majority of patients have advanced disease at the time of presentation. Dynamic, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) has become the radiographic study of choice in the pre-operative staging of patients with pancreatic cancer. While it has been shown to be highly sensitive in determining unresectability of peri-ampullary tumors, the ability of CT to predict accurately which tumors can be safely resected is still limited. Laparoscopic staging of peri-ampullary tumors is superior to dynamic CT in visualizing small liver and peritoneal metastases. The addition of laparoscopic ultrasound during laparoscopic staging enhances the ability of laparoscopy to determine resectability of these tumors and approaches the accuracy of open exploration without increasing significant morbidity or mortality. Patients who are deemed unresectable at the time of laparoscopy can undergo palliative biliary and/or gastric bypass procedures laparoscopically and further minimize the morbidity of laparotomy."
CD009323,0,9778683,1,Role of laparoscopy in the staging of gastrointestinal cancer.,"Accurate staging plays a primary role in determining the appropriate treatment of gastrointestinal malignancies. Recently, laparoscopy has emerged as a staging modality that is more sensitive and specific in staging most gastrointestinal cancers than preoperative imaging modalities. The addition of laparoscopic ultrasonographic techniques has achieved even greater staging accuracy. Consequently, patients with disease that is amenable to resection are better identified, and others with locally advanced disease are spared unnecessary laparotomies. Since laparoscopic techniques may be associated with low morbidity and a rapid recovery, palliative procedures are being developed for patients with advanced gastrointestinal malignancies. This reviews summarizes the current status of laparoscopic staging of gastrointestinal malignancies and compares this technique to preoperative imaging modalities. Also discussed are promising staging technologies and therapeutic procedures that may soon play an important role in the management of gastrointestinal cancer patients."

In both patients, the findings of 99mTc-N-substituted-2,6-dimethylphenyl carbamoylethyl iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scanning were interpreted as clearly demonstrating a significant bile leak in one and the complete absence of bile passage from the liver to the intestines in the other. These findings could result from either spontaneous closure of the bile leak or false-positive HIDA scans. Subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed the common bile duct and the cystic duct to be normal, without any evidence of bile leakage or any problem with drainage to the intestines. In all patients who have a positive 99mTc-HIDA scan, ERCP should be performed before deciding on further surgical intervention."
CD009323,0,9773005,0,[Staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer].,"The aim of this review is to report results of investigations used in the staging of pancreatic cancer and draw a practical approach in the treatment of this cancer. For the diagnosis of pancreatic mass and the diagnosis of malignancy, ultrasonography and helical-CT seem to be the best methods. In cases of non evident malignancy, diagnosis of pancreatic cancer can be done by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and confirmed by transcutaneous biopsy, under CT locating. The diagnosis of vascular involvement is usually done by helical-CT, while endoscopic ultrasonography gives best results in the diagnosis of lymph node involvement. The diagnosis of hepatic and peritoneal metastasis can be difficult, specially in case of small peritoneal deposits, but accuracy of helical-CT remains high. Grading of these investigations depends on the situation after performing ultrasonography and CT scan. When a pancreatic resection seems to be possible, a surgical treatment can be directly proposed or preceding by endoscopic ultrasonography for lymph node diagnosis, and/or laparoscopy for detection of small peritoneal deposits."

CD009323,0,9755913,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy facilitated by hydrodissection.,"Hydrodissection has been used in the past in open cholecystectomy to facilitate dissection in difficult cases. Injection of 50 mL of saline, with a laparoscopic cyst aspiration needle during laparoscopic cholecystectomy between the gallbladder and the liver, causes an edematous area 1-1.5 cm thick between the gallbladder and the liver. This allows dissection to be carried out prograde and retrograde with less bleeding and a much smaller chance of gallbladder perforation and the escape of stones. One hundred and thirty-three laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LC) utilizing hydrodissection were compared to 48 historical controls (HC), comparing blood loss, stone spillage, and dissection time. Blood loss was on average less than 5 mL in the LC group and 56 mL in the HC. One case of minor biliary spillage occurred in the LC group and 11 gallbladder perforations in the HC group. Time taken for the dissection was 6.4 minutes for LC and 16 minutes for HC. Laparoscopic hydrodissection was accompanied by less bleeding, fewer incidents of gallbladder damage and stone spilling, and a much faster dissection time. It can also be performed prograde, which is helpful in liver cirrhosis."

CD009323,0,9752500,0,[Epidemiology and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinomas in cirrhosis].,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primary cancer of the liver and the most frequent tumour in males, worldwide. The annual incidence of HCC is maximum in Asian and African countries, lower in western countries where it is close to 4/100,000 inhabitants. In 90% of the cases, HCC complicates course of liver cirrhosis, with an annual incidence in cirrhoties of 2 to 6%. Risk factors for HCC in cirrhotics are male gender (sex-ratio: 4/1), age (above 50 years old), macronodular cirrhosis and large cell dysplasia. HCC can complicate the course of cirrhosis of any cause, but might be less frequent in primary biliary cirrhosis, Wilson's disease and auto-immune hepatitis. Currently, the diagnosis of HCC is usually considered in the presence of a focal nodular lesion, during systematic ultrasonographic examination of the liver. In high incidence areas, HCC can still be diagnosed because of HCC-related symptoms. In the case of a focal lesion discovered on a cirrhotic liver, the diagnosis of HCC can be confirmed by studying the behaviour of the lesion of helical CT scan of the liver (enhancement of the tumour during the arterial phase) or MRI (hyperintensity of the tumour on T2 relaxation time); study of peritumour vessels can also be helpful. Serum alpha-foeto-protein level, when higher than 300 to 500 micrograms/L is very specific of HCC. When aggressive treatment of HCC is considered and when the diagnosis of HCC remains uncertain, HCC can be assessed by means of cytological or histological study of the tumour on samples taken by fineneedle aspiration (80% sensitivity) or liver biopsy during laparoscopic laparotomy. Forthcoming improvements in imaging technology might eliminate the need for such invasive diagnostic techniques in the future."

We successfully performed a systematic laparoscopic left lateral segmentectomy in a 62-year-old man with HCC. The tumor was located in the left lateral segment of the liver, and measured approximately 4 cm in diameter. Since no other tumors were detected in the liver or in any distant organs, the patient was considered to be a candidate for surgery. A laparoscopic hepatic resection was selected as the procedure of choice. Prior to dissection of the liver parenchyma, the arteries and branches of the portal vein feeding the left lateral segment were divided and dissected, together with the branches of the biliary tree in the umbilical portion of the left pedicle of Glisson's capsule. The liver parenchyma was then dissected and the left hepatic vein divided and dissected, and transection of the left lateral segment was completed. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged on postoperative days 14. No evidence of recurrence has been noted in the 22 months after surgery (the time of this report). This less invasive surgery, taking into consideration the pathogenesis of HCC, may be a useful new approach in selected patients with this tumor."

CD009323,0,9745070,0,Laparoscopic treatment of congenital choledochal cyst.,"We describe the laparoscopic treatment of a patient presenting with congenital choledochal cyst. Our patient was a 19-year-old man with a complaint of recurrent abdominal pain due to pancreatitis. The choledochal cyst was type I and had a common channel of pancreatobiliary duct, as revealed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Under laparoscopic guidance, the dilated bile duct and the gallbladder were excised, and a Roux-en-Y anastomosis was constructed with an endo-EEA. Finally, end-to-side anastomosis was carried out by the continuous suture method, aided by an Endostitch between the stump of the hepatic duct and the Roux-en-Y limb. After the operation, slight hyperamylasemia was observed for several days but further treatment was not necessary. Postoperative symptoms were minimal, and the patient was discharged on the 11th day after the procedure. Although it is difficult and time-consuming, laparoscopic operation is highly beneficial for the patient. The use of such instruments as the endostapler and Endostitch may help to simplify this complex intracorporeal procedure involving division and anastomosis of the digestive tract."

CD009323,0,9731805,1,"Lesser sac endoscopy and laparoscopy in pancreatic carcinoma definitive diagnosis, staging and palliation.","Laparoscopy with lesser sac endoscopy (LSE) were used in combination from 1987 to 1992 in 103 patients for differentiation between pancreatic carcinoma and other peripancreatic pathology, staging, and palliation. LSE identified pancreatic carcinoma in 38 patients; pancreatic cystadenocarcinoma in 2 patients; pancreatic cystadenoma in 3 patients; pancreatic adenoma in 1 patient; pancreatic metastases from liver in 2 patients; and pancreatic cysts in 5 patients. False negative diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma occurred in two cases. Nontumor pancreatic pathology was revealed in 10 patients. Specifically, acute pancreatitis was found in four patients, and chronic pancreatitis was found in six patients. Extrapancreatic cancers were identified in 15 patients: retroperitoneal extraorgan tumors were found in 2 patients; extrahepatic biliary tract cancer in 6 patients; gallbladder cancer in 1 patient; liver cancer in 3 patients; and stomach cancer in 1 patient. In five cases no pathology was found. Overall correct definitive diagnosis was established in 101 patients. Sensitivity of laparoscopy with LSE for pancreatic carcinoma diagnosis proved to be 95 per cent (38 of 40 patients), for pancreatic tumors diagnosis 96.22 per cent (51 of 53 patients); specificity of the method 100 per cent; and accuracy of diagnosis 98 per cent (101 of 103 patients). Thus, the accuracy of the method was as high as the accuracy of combination of all known modalities. Criteria of unresectability were revealed with the combination of LSE and laparoscopy in 75 per cent (30 of 40 cases) of pancreatic carcinoma. Moreover, laparoscopy allowed palliation of pancreatic carcinoma. Laparoscopic cholecystostomy was performed in 10 patients, and laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy with enteroenterostomy was performed in 6 patients."

CD009323,0,9700619,0,Is growth influencing diameter and function of laparoscopic TESA hepaticojejunostomy? A comparison of adult minipigs and juvenile domestic swine.,"Current treatment of obstructive jaundice includes endoscopic stenting and open surgical bypass. To combine the advantages of surgical bypass with the minimal invasive approach of endoscopic stenting we developed a laparoscopic technique, transient endoluminally stented anastomosis (TESA). As shown previously, small-diameter anastomoses (e.g., hepaticojejunostomy) by TESA technique can be performed reliably in growing domestic swine. This further preclinical trial was designed to exclude growth of the animals as the main reason for these excellent results. After ligation of the common bile duct, a laparoscopic Roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy was performed 7 days later by TESA with a reabsorbable radiopaque polyglycolic acid stent. In group A (n = 7) growing domestic pigs and in group B (n = 5) adult minipigs were operated on. Laboratory parameters were controlled weekly. Stent degradation was followed by weekly abdominal x-ray. At necropsy 6 months after surgery, cholangiography was performed and the anastomoses were measured. Mean weight gain was 140.7 +/- 10.9 kg in domestic pigs versus 5.8 +/- 1.6 kg in minipigs. Cholestasis normalized within 7 days postoperatively. Duration of stenting was not significantly different between groups. Cholangiography at necropsy showed immediate runoff through the anastomoses in both groups. The diameter of the anastomosis was 4.7 +/- 0.5 mm in group A versus 3.0 +/- 0.4 mm in group B (p = 0.03). In conclusion, functionality of the small-diameter TESA hepaticojejunostomy is not related to age and growing factors in pigs, justifying its application in human as the next step of investigation."

CD009323,0,9683761,0,Common bile duct stones: management strategies in the laparoscopic era.,"We reviewed our experience with the treatment of common bile duct (CBD) stones in 70 patients by sequential endoscopic-laparoscopic management and single-stage laparoscopic treatment during the past 7 years. The advantages, disadvantages, and feasibility of the two procedures are discussed to elucidate therapeutic strategies for patients harboring gallbladder stones and associated choledocholithiasis. In 44 patients, sequential endoscopic-laparoscopic management was indicatedd, and was successful in 37 of them but, in seven patients endoscopic stone extraction could not be accomplished. Single-stage laparoscopic treatment was attempted in 26 patients. In practice, laparoscopic transcystic common duct exploration or choledochotomy may not always be feasible if the cystic duct or CBD are not dilated; there is a high risk of intraoperative CBD injury in such circumstances. Laparoscopic management was considered to be especially useful for the treatment of numerous, large or difficult stones, because stone removal could be succesfully performed without any injury to the papilla of Vater. This last issue is of particular importance in patients with dilated CBD, because insufficient opening of the ampulla of Vater made by endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) may lead to stasis and reflux-related complications such as cholangitis and recurrent stones. We conclude that the most rational management of CBD stones should be decided according to the size of the CBD, which depends on the size, number, and location of stones. Patients with dilated CBD are indicated to under-go laparoscopic single-stage treatment and combined endoscopic-laparoscopic treatment may be best for patients with non-dilated CBD."

After six cycles of chemotherapy the pancreatic lesion was unchanged. Suggestive ulceration of the vulva with edema appeared at the end of chemotherapy. After right vulvar excision, distal pancreatic resection with splenectomy was carried out by a hand-assisted laparoscopic technique utilizing a small muscle-splitting right lower quadrant incision. This allowed for palpation of the peritoneal cavity for evidence of tumor and allowed for safe and expeditious pancreatectomy. The pancreatic tumor was found to be a serous cystadenoma without evidence of malignancy. T-cell lymphoma was identified in the spleen and the vulva. The patient was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day and returned to normal activity within 2 weeks after operation. Two months after the surgery, computed tomography demonstrated a 3-cm pseudocyst in the region of the tail of the pancreas. As the patient was asymptomatic, this required no further therapy.

In the period between 01.11.94 and 01.04.96 we performed 1620 endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatographies including 410 papillotomies at the second Department of Medicine in the Clinic of Suhl. Thereby in 2.1% (34 cases) of patients a complication after laparosopic cholecystectomy was seen and endoscopically controlled. Residual bile duct stones were removed without any problems by papillotomy and stone extraction. Biliary leckage were brigded by stent implantation. In case of aberrant cystic duct it was also possible to implant a stent depending on anatomical situation. All patients were followed up over a period of 6 to 8 month after endoscopic procedure. All except two patients showed an occlusion of biliary leckage and the bile duct stent could be revved. In one case, a younger patient, with a failed endoscopic occlusion of biliary fistula had to undergo a further operation because of residual gallbladder tissue. In the other case, a 84-years old patient, we use a new method, developed at our department, for selective embolization of the cystic duct to prevent a relaparotomy.

Praeoperative diagnostic makes it possible to select the individual optimal therapy for each patient, the possibility of saving the Papilla vateri gives the large scale indication to laparoscopic common bile duct exploration. Also suspected stones gets a one-time cure therapy by complete laparoscopic operation. After balloon-dilatation of cysticus duct to 6 mm, the laparoscopic choledochoscopy is possible through the cysticus duct. Little stones are flushed into the duodenum or extracted by Segura-basket through the cysticus duct. Big stones needs a Laser- or electrohydraulic lithotripsy, the stonefragments can be flushed into the duodenum or aspirated through the cysticus duct. Multiple big or proximal incarcerated stones gives the indication for laparoscopic choledochotomy. Effective extraction is possible by big Segura-basket, residual stones are taken out under choledochoscopic control by little Segura-basket. Incarcerated stones needs the lithotripsy. Microdrainage of the common bile duct and only in special indication the T-tube saves the gall-flow to restitution of papilla function, the common bile duct is closed by running suture in Lahodny-technique.

The result has been that most working groups now favour a ""therapeutic splitting"" approach. This means that, wherever possible, endoscopic revision of the bile duct is first attempted. If, during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, intraoperative cholangiography reveals the presence of bile duct stones, they may, after consultation with the endoscopist, be left in place for removal by endoscopic papillotomy at some later date. Only in the case of very young patients and exceptionally, a highly experienced laparoscopic surgeon may attempt a transcystic extraction of such stones.

CD009323,0,9602846,0,Intraoperative and laparoscopic ultrasound.,"Intraoperative ultrasound, whether during celiotomy or laparoscopy, plays an important role in assisting the surgeon in directing appropriate therapy for intra-abdominal diseases, particularly primary or metastatic malignancies involving the liver and primary malignancies of the pancreas and upper gastrointestinal tract. It is the most sensitive imaging technique for detecting small intraparenchymal lesions of the liver, pancreas, and other solid organs. Owing to its increased sensitivity over all commonly used preoperative imaging studies, it is responsible for changing the intraoperative treatment plan of these tumors in a significant percentage of cases. This is particularly true with respect to resectability. In the era of laparoscopic surgery, it replaces the surgeon's inability to palpate the liver and other organs during surgery. As surgeons use a laparoscopic approach with increasing frequency to treat intra-abdominal disease, they will have an increasing need to master the use of intraoperative ultrasound in order to render optimal care to their patients."

CD009323,0,9584570,0,[Stage-adapted radical principles in gastric carcinoma].,"The aim of any surgical approach to gastric carcinoma should be a complete resection with no residual tumor left behind, that is, a R0-resection according to UICC. Complete tumor resection in this respect refers to the primary tumor as well as to the lymphatic drainage and requires an adequate safety margin. The indications for surgical therapy of gastric cancer and the choice of procedure should consequently be guided by the tumor stage. This requires accurate preoperative staging, which can today be achieved with endoscopic ultrasonography and surgical laparoscopy. Gastric carcinoma stage IA (mucosa carcinoma) can be cured by local excision. In patients with tumor Stages IB (submucosa carcinoma), II, and IIIA, lymph node metastases are common. Based on the available data, this group of patients benefits from radical resection and D2 lymph node dissection. The overall 5-year survival rate of 50% for the large number of patients undergoing gastric resection for cancer seems to demonstrate convincingly the value of extended lymphadenectomy. In patients with advanced gastric carcinoma, that is, tumor stages IIIB and IV, a complete tumor removal usually can not be achieved by surgical dissection. Neoadjuvant therapeutic modalities should consequently be assessed in these patients. Based on tumor location and growth pattern, a total gastrectomy is the procedure of choice in patients with middle and proximal third gastric cancer. A subtotal gastrectomy may be performed in patients with tumors of the distal third and ""Laurens intestinal type"" growth pattern. The distal site of the main lesion must be investigated carefully to ensure that incidental concomitant lesions are not overlooked. Depending on the individual tumor situation, the gastrectomy can be extended toward varying portions of the distal esophagus or the pancreas, preserving splenectomy and resection of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The high incidence of locoregional recurrences and distant metastases after curative surgery for gastric cancer calls for improved locoregional control and systemic adjuvant treatment."

Controversial aspects in the surgery of carcinoma of the pancreas].,"Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis also after resection with a 5 years' survival of about 5% in operated patients. The main clinical issue in patients with a malignant tumour is to identify the ones that would benefit from a surgical treatment. Resectability of pancreatic cancer has not an absolute value and the possible advantages in terms of prognosis and quality of life should be balanced with surgical mortality and morbidity. For this reason the management of this disease involves a multidisciplinary approach and the surgeon should join with the other specialists in experienced oncology centers. En exhaustive evaluation of the following prognostic factors should be made pre and intra-operatively to better define life expectancy with or without resection: Histotype: endocrine tumours and cystadenocarcinoma have, in general, a better prognosis, Staging: JPS classification has a better prognostic value if compared to the UICC. Completeness of the resection. Biological characteristics of the tumour. The main variables to be considered for the exeresis are: Size and local growth of the tumour (also considering the involvement of vessels, retroperitoneum and pancreatic capsule). Liver or peritoneal metastases: for this laparoscopy has a key role for staging. Histologic confirmation: differential diagnosis with chronic pancreatitis is sometimes difficult and every attempt should be made to have a pre-operative histology. Vascular invasion is one of the main contraindications to surgery and an exhaustive evaluation of vascular involvement should be considered mandatory. Lymph nodal involvement, in general, represents a negative prognostic factor even if Japanese authors claim that a radical resection can be performed in case of positive nodes in the peripancreatic area, if a complete lymphadenectomy is carried out."

Therapeutic management depends on surgeon's evaluation of anatomic situation, patient's age and general condition. Similarly, sometimes only surgical evaluation can show if cancer can be resected or not. Laparoscopy seems useful to detect small peritoneal metastases which can not be seen with other procedures. In the last years, reduction of morbidity and mortality is the main goal achieved. Excluding some selected surveys, long term survival is still disappointing."

Estimated blood loss was significantly lower in LGJ patients (270.2 +/- 45.8 ml vs. 66 +/- 15.7 ml, p < 0.01). When 13 of 22 patients undergoing OGJ for treatment were compared with 9 LGJ patients, only estimated blood loss (p < 0.01) and hospital stay (p < 0.05) were significantly reduced in LGJ patients.

CD009323,0,9563443,0,Gastric cancer in Asia: progress and controversies in surgical management.,"Considerable controversy surrounds the management of gastric cancer and this has largely overshadowed recent progress in our understanding of the epidemiology and molecular pathogenesis of the disease, and improvements in diagnostic and staging techniques. Differences identifiable in the molecular pathogenesis of the 'intestinal' and 'diffuse' types of gastric cancer may help to unravel the biological behaviour of variants and ultimately influence therapeutic strategies. Endoscopic ultrasound is well established as being accurate for T staging and the introduction of laparoscopy, with or without ultrasound, is obviating unnecessary laparotomy in non-bleeding, non-obstructed patients. Controversies in surgery encompass the role of laparoscopic surgery in early gastric cancer, the extent of lymphadenectomy including para-aortic nodal dissection, resection of en bloc contiguous organ involvement, pancreatosplenectomy, left upper abdominal evisceration, and modes of reconstruction (pylorus-preserving gastrectomy, pouch formation) to enhance quality of life. Whereas adjuvant chemotherapy does not impact favourably on survival, emphasis has now shifted to neoadjuvant (induction) chemotherapy to downstage the disease. Preoperative regional chemotherapy and intra-operative hyperthermic chemotherapy or irradiation may prove to be of benefit in patients with resectable disease, but some scepticism still exists as to the usefulness of biological response modifiers (e.g. OK432, PSK) for adjuvant treatment. Ethical issues relating to cultural differences in Asia sometimes mitigate against adequate trial design (e.g. a surgery-alone control group or a no adjuvant therapy treatment group may be considered inappropriate) and this has understandably hindered acceptance in Western countries of the value of current management practices in Asia. These issues and the need for ongoing well-conducted randomized trials with prospective subset analysis are now being addressed."
CD009323,0,9545853,0,[Cholelithiasis--laparoscopy or laparotomy?].,"Between 10% and 15% of the adult population have gallstones and therefore symptomatic cholelithiasis is the second most common indication for surgery in general practice. It's diagnosis depends on the patients history, clinical findings, laboratory tests and ultrasound. In case of symptomatic gallstones surgery offers the only permanent cure and specific complications due to gallstones such as ileus or fistula are becoming rare. With the introduction of minimal invasive surgery at the end of this century laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now considered to be the standard treatment for symptomatic gallstones. This approach can be offered to > 90% of patients in elective cases and in between 60%-80% of patients having acute cholecystitis with a low morbidity and mortality rate. The main advantages of the laparoscopic approach are the overall increased patients comfort with less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, recovery and off work time. Although the rate of common bile duct injury appears to be increased using this minimal invasive approach, this rate is still sufficiently small to justify the use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic disease. Open cholecystecomy remains the treatment of choice for complicated gallstone disease (i.e. cancer, Mirizzi syndrome, severe inflammation) and high risk patients. In case of acute cholecystitis the laparoscopic treatment with all it's advantages may also be offered to many patients. However, in those cases the conversion rate to the open approach may be markedly increased which has not to be considered as a complication of the laparoscopic approach but as a maximization of safety and effectiveness of the treatment."

CD009323,0,9539648,0,Suspected biliary complications after laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy leading to endoscopic cholangiography: a retrospective comparison.,"To study how suspected postoperative biliary complications are influenced by surgical technique, we compared clinical profiles of 63 patients referred for ERCP after open (OC) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) over a four-year period. ERCP was not performed for postoperative pain alone and only six (9.5%) studies were normal. Referrals after LC were younger (mean 39.1 vs 53.6 years, P < 0.001) and ERCP was requested earlier (mean 71.6 vs 2360 days, P < 0.001) in the postoperative course. Choledocholithiasis (CDL) alone, the most common finding, was successfully managed with a single ERCP in 97.2% of cases. CDL after LC occurred in younger patients (35.5 vs 58.9 years, P < 0.01) who presented earlier (mean 98.6 days vs 5.1 years, P < 0.01), without biliary ductal dilatation (P < 0.01). Although CDL after LC was associated with higher ALT and bilirubin levels than after OC, the difference was not statistically significant. Cystic duct leaks (LC: six patients, OC: four patients) were typically associated with CDL after OC and 90% resolved with endoscopic therapy. Biliary ligation (four cases) was managed successfully with choledochojejunostomy. We conclude that findings at ERCP for suspected biliary obstruction or injury after OC or LC are similar and usually can be endoscopically managed. After LC, referrals currently are younger, present much earlier, and retained stones are less likely to be associated with ductal dilatation than after OC."

To evaluate the clinical significance of .NO production under surgical stress, serial measurements of plasma nitrite plus nitrate levels were performed in 45 surgical patients. Group A included 19 patients who underwent major surgery with uneventful postoperative courses. Group B included 18 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Group C included 8 patients whose surgery was complicated by intra-abdominal abscesses. Eight healthy volunteers served as controls. Plasma nitrate levels were determined with a redox chemiluminescence .NO analyzer and coincided with measurements made by high-performance liquid chromatography (r = 0.868, p < 0.0001, 58 samples). During laparotomy, arterial nitrate levels correlated well with peripheral, portal, and hepatic venous nitrate levels (r = 0.966, 0.938, and 0.949, respectively; p < 0.0001). A significant decrease in nitrate from preoperative levels in groups A (postoperative day (POD) 1 and 3; p < 0.0005) and B (POD 1, p < 0.0001) was observed; nitrate levels in group C did not decrease for 14 days after surgery. Plasma nitrate levels in groups A and B were significantly different (POD 1 through 6, p < 0.05) and at POD 3 were significantly lower in group A (p < 0.005). Plasma nitrate levels measured before and after fasting or food intake were not significantly different. These results suggest that surgical stress leads to a decrease in the end product of .NO in the whole body, and that the greater the surgical stress the longer the duration of decreased .NO production."

CD009323,0,9499186,1,Diagnosing and staging of pancreatic carcinoma-what is necessary?,"The aim of the present prospective observational study was to diagnose and stage pancreatic carcinoma with a minimum of diagnostic procedures. Our experiences in 307 patients with a histologically confirmed pancreatic carcinoma show that for diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma sonography and computed tomography are sufficient in 95% of the cases. The combination of both has a sensitivity equal to that of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP; 96.8 vs. 98.7%; n.s., chi2 test). ERCP is only indicated in cases with negative sonography and computed tomography, and suspicion of pancreatic cancer. For tumor staging, the routine performance of angiography cannot be recommended in view of the fact that although it provides greater sensitivity for the evaluation of an infiltration of the portal vein (80% for angiography vs. 22% for sonography or computed tomography), it is associated with a lower positive predictive value (56.4 vs. 68 and 72%) which results in a lower accuracy. Despite recent advantages in diagnostic technology, less than 50% of unresectable tumors were identified preoperatively at a 10% false-positive rate. The major reason for unresectability is infiltration into the mesenteric axis, which cannot be identified laparoscopically. Laparoscopy or percutaneous biopsy is recommended only in the presence of a tumor with suspicion of distant metastasis detected by radiological imaging and requiring histological confirmation. In conclusion, sonography and computed tomography as the only diagnostic images are sufficient for diagnosing and staging of pancreatic carcinoma in more than 95% of the patients. Only a small number of patients needs further diagnostic procedures."
CD009323,0,9497884,0,Regionalization of occult pancreatic insulinomas with the arterial stimulation venous sampling (ASVS) technique.,"Non-invasive modalities (ultrasound, computerized tomography, MRI and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy) often fail to localize insulinomas smaller than 1.5 cm in diameter. Recently, regionalization of such occult insulinomas was facilitated by the arterial stimulation and venous sampling (ASVS) technique, using calcium as the insulin secretagogue. However, so far experience with this technique has been limited to a few tertiary referrals centres worldwide. In these case studies we report our experience in three consecutive patients with occult insulinomas. Three consecutive patients (all men 34, 51 and 56 years of age) with insulin-mediated hypoglycaemia were studied. Diagnosis of insulin hypersection was established by the finding of a high amended insulin: blood sugar ratio during fasting. Localization of a pancreatic mass lesion was unsuccessful by ultrasound, CT and/or MRI in all patients. Two patients had negative octreotide scans. In all patients after the infusion of calcium sequentially into the gastroduodenal, splenic and the superior mesenteric arteries, insulin levels rose significantly in right hepatic vein samples giving rise to diagnostic gradients from the splenic artery (in 2 patients) and gastroduodenal artery (in 1 patient), regionalizing insulinomas in the tail and head or neck of the pancreas respectively. The simultaneously obtained angiogram was positive in only 1 patient, in whom it corresponded to the insulin gradient. Regionalization of these occult tumours was subsequently confirmed at laparoscopy in the 2 patients operated. It is concluded, that the arterial stimulation venous sampling technique is an effective method in regionalizing occult insulinomas and should complement invasive angiography whenever the latter procedure is performed."
CD009323,0,9478053,0,[Minimally invasive surgery in the management of Mirizzi syndrome].,"An impacted gallstone in the cystic duct or in the Hartman's pouch with subsequent inflammation and edema resulting in extrinsic compression of the common hepatic or common bile duct with obstructive jaundice is known as Mirizzi's syndrome. The Mirizzi syndrome presents a difficult surgical challenge because of the dense adhesions and edematous inflammatory tissue cause distortion of the normal anatomy in Calot's triangle, leading to a great risk of bile duct injury. Therefore, a controversial issue the surgical strategy for the treatment of Mirizzi's syndrome since the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the applicability of microlaparotomy cholecystectomy in the management of Mirizzi's syndrome. Between December 1990 and December 1996 we operated on 16 patients for Mirizzi's syndrome. In 14 of these patients had type I of Mirizzi's syndrome, the remaining 2 had type II of this syndrome. In 13 of these patients the gallbladder were removed using 3-4 cm single microlaparotomy incisions. In the remaining 3 patients using 5.5 cm, 8 cm as well as 12 cm long incisions for the removal of the gallbladder, and placement T tube because of stenosis of the common hepatic duct, suture repair of the choledochal defect as well as choledochoplasty. In 12 of these patients the microlaparotomy cholecystectomy were done within 7 days of the onset of the obstructive cholecystitis. The postoperative stay of these patients were uneventful and they were discharged home 3 days after surgery. We conclude that early operation of the obstructive cholecystitis with Mirizzi's syndrome eliminates the serious stricture and fistula formation of Mirizzi's syndrome."

A radical procedure including wedge resection of the gallbladder bed, resection of the extrahepatic bile ducts, and dissection of the regional nodes and interaortocaval nodes was performed 17 days after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a 60-year-old woman. The final histologic examination revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading perimuscular connective tissue with one positive pericholedochal node (pT2, pN1, pM0). Despite the absence of intraperitoneal dissemination at reexploration, the patient had intraperitoneal dissemination 5 months after the second operation. Insidious intraperitoneal dissemination may decrease the survival rate of locally advanced carcinoma of the gallbladder after laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared with open cholecystectomy. Surgeons should search for unsuspected carcinoma of the gallbladder intraoperatively to avoid implantation metastasis."

During recent years laparoscopic cholecystectomy became popular but we have not found in the literature the mention of either that it could cause cystic duct stump syndrome or it could be used for its treatment. During the last seven years in 8 patients we found gallbladder remnants or cystic duct stumps causing their symptoms. Among the 8 patients 3 had laparoscopic and 5 classic cholecystectomies. After incomplete cholecystectomy we usually find that the cystic duct stump and the Calot triangle embedded in inflamed scar tissue. For this reason the surgical risk is to high with laparoscopic surgery to reoperate for these pathological changes. In all 8 cases the pathological cystic duct stumps and gallbladder remnants were removed using 3-4 cm single microlaparotomy incisions. The postoperative stay of these patients were uneventful and they were discharged home 2-3 days after surgery."

The importance of preoperative cholangiography is emphasized for accurate diagnosis and preoperative location of the gallbladder."
CD009323,0,22462211,0,[Are laparoscopic operations on stomach useful?].,"The purpose of this review is to assess the position of laparoscopic gastric surgery. Only for perforated gastric and duodenal ulcers a prospective randomized study is available without revealing meaningful differences between conventional and laparoscopic procedure. The elective laparoscopic Selective Proximal Vagotomy (SPV) of stomach and duodenal ulcers was reported on some 200 patients till now. The perioperative risk was lower than that of the conventional method. Due to only short follow-up statements on the risk of ulcer recurrence and therefore completion of vagotomy can not be made. Because of operative technical difficulties some examinators have modified the Selective Proximal Vagotomy, but long-term results with these techniques and the conventional method do not exist. Till now a laparoscopic resection of the stomach was done in less than 100 patients. At comparable risk of both methods representative conclusions could not be made. Similar small are the experiences with laparoscopic resection of the stomach or gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma. The results suppose that a systematic lymph node dissection of the compartment II is only restrictevly possible. The operative risk is nearly that of the conventional method. Laparoscopic staging is a favourable indication in gastric surgery with the aim to detect peritoneal metastases and to spare the patient an exploratory laparotomy. Furthermore, laparoscopy offers advantages in palliative procedures, without existence of extensive proof. Nowadays it is applied for extreme obesity and ""Gastric Banding"", a method with low perioperative risk. Whether the long-term results are equivalent to those of conventional stomach bypass operations is not proved so far. Alltogether the advantages of laparoscopy in comparison to conventional gastric surgery are only obvious in a few clinical situations. Qualified randomized prospective studies are necessary to evaluate the new operation techniques."
CD009323,0,9410677,0,"[Intraoperative cholangiography as a routine method? A prospective, controlled, randomized study].","A prospective, controlled, randomized trial was conducted in 275 patients with symptomatic gall stone disease, whose history, laboratory data or sonographical findings did not suggest common bile duct stones. Of these patients, 137 did not undergo intraoperative fluoroscopic cholangiography (IOC), but in the remaining 138 patients IOC was attempted. In 111 cases (80.4%) the biliary system was sufficiently visualized. In 3 patients (2.7%) calculi in the cystic or common bile duct were diagnosed, which would have been overlooked without IOC. IOC was false-positive in one case. One year after the operation the patients were asked to return for a follow-up examination. Three patients in the group without IOC had had symptomatic passage of a stone, and one had a common bile duct stone removed by endoscopic papillotomy. A retained stone was discussed as etiology for a pancreatitis in a fifth patient in this group. No patient sustained long-term sequelae from the retained common bile duct stones. None of the patients in the IOC group had evidence of cholangiolithiasis at follow-up. There was no difference between the study groups concerning the incidence of post-operative complications. The operations with IOC lasted significantly longer (92 +/- 31 min vs 77 +/- 28 min). According to our data and those published earlier, the additional financial and logistic expenditure associated with routine IOC is not justified. Patients with the preoperative suspicion of a common bile duct stone should have endoscopic bile duct clearance (ERCP and EPT) prior to cholecystectomy."

Procedures such as jejunostomies, diagnosis of intestinal obstruction or ischemia, resection of the small bowel, and lysis of adhesions can be managed with this technique. We present our experience with four cases undergoing laparoscopic resection of the small bowel. The mean age of the three males and one female was 55 years. The operative procedure was performed under general anesthesia with complete laparoscopic exploration of the abdominal cavity. The type of pathology and extent of disease was defined: one had leiomyoma, two had unspecific ileitis, and one had metastatic breast cancer. This was followed by exteriorization and resection. Patients were allowed to have a liquid diet the day of surgery. The average hospital stay was 3 to 4 days. The mean intraoperative time was 124 minutes. No postoperative complications were observed. Laparoscopic small bowel resection can be performed expeditiously and with minimal morbidity, allowing accurate diagnosis and treatment of these conditions."
CD009323,0,9354066,0,Complications following cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the gold standard for cholelithiasis. Nevertheless possible complications must not be underestimated. In this department, from 1 July 1991 to 30 November 1995, 1005 patients with cholelithiasis underwent videocholecystectomy. There was no peri-operative mortality. In 36 cases (3.6%) the procedure was changed to laparotomy. In four cases (0.4%) conversion was mandatory due to severe complications: in three patients while introducing a trocar (one aortic lesion, one middle colic vein injury and one visceral perforation) and in one patient due to bleeding in the hepatic hilar region. In 32 cases (3.2%) conversion was carried out electively. This was due to technical difficulties or to choledocholithiasis (22 patients), anaesthesiological problems (three cases), biliodigestive fistula (one), bile spillage from accessory hepatic ducts (three), unexpected colonic cancer (one), instrument malfunction (two cases). Twenty-four patients (2.4%) experienced post-operative complications: one with pneumothorax, two with bile leakage (one bile duct damage, and one cystic duct leakage), eight with haemoperitoneum, five with subphrenic abscess, three with anaemia, three with intraparietal collections, one with bilateral basal bronchopneumonia, one with perforated duodenal stress ulcer. Of these, 11 patients (1%) underwent reintervention: five re-laparoscopies, three conversions, and three open laparotomies. This study demonstrates the safety of videolaparocholecystectomy. Complications are relatively rare and can be often dealt with conservative treatment or re-laparoscopy. Complications are often linked to insertion of a blind trocar or to the induction of a closed pneumoperitoneum. Meticulous technique or open laparoscopy minimize these risks. Conversion must not be considered a defeat but a wise decision in the face of major difficulties. Under these principles, videocholecystectomy is safe and represents the best treatment of gallbladder stones."

CD009323,0,9287993,0,Evolution and current status of the Whipple procedure: an update for gastroenterologists.,"The Whipple procedure has undergone a remarkable gradual evolution in the last 20 years, of which many gastroenterologists are unaware. Improvements in staging, particularly staging laparoscopy with ultrasonography, have reduced the incidence of negative laparotomies. The forbidding mortality of pancreaticoduodenectomy, approximately 20% just a generation ago, has decreased precipitously in high-volume referral centers. Near zero mortality rates are now common. Morbidity and length of stay have also been reduced. Cardiac and pulmonary complications have been markedly reduced, whereas others such as pancreatic fistula still remain a problem. Modifications of the procedure have been introduced to improve long-term outcome of pancreatic cancer and to lessen digestive sequelae. Total pancreatectomy and large regional excisions did not improve results. However, 5-year survival rates of 20% are now reported by several centers for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, and long-term survival rates for other periampullary tumors are approximately 40%. Pylorus-sparing procedures can be performed and may lessen postoperative sequelae. The clinical consequences of improved results are that large numbers of procedures are being performed at specialty centers, providing the opportunity to perform clinical trials, and that the procedure is used more widely, for instance, in benign diseases such as chronic pancreatitis."

Results for 96 patients from three different hospitals are reviewed].,"At laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a procedure routinely used at Swedish surgery departments today, common bile duct stones are found to be present in 5-10 per cent of cases. During recent years, several alternative procedures have been evolved for the management of duct stones, such as operative or postoperative endoscopic sphincterolomy, or conversion to open surgery and choledochotomy. The article gives an account of laparoscopic treatment of common bile duct stones, and results obtained in 96 patients from three surgery departments in Sweden. Three different primary techniques were used: saline flushing via the cholangiography catheter, after intravenous injection of 1 mg of glucagon (in six cases of small stones); transcystic common duct exploration (TCDE), with cholodochoscopy and a Dermia basket (68 cases); and laparoscopic choledochotomy and choledochoscopy (22 cases). The success rate was 88 per cent (84/96), and mortality zero. In many cases the postoperative course was similar to that of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy alone. We recommend TCDE in cases of common bile duct stones of no more than 8-9 mm in diameter, and where the cystic duct is large. Single-stage laparoscopic treatment of bile duct stones seems to be a safe and effective method of dealing with two problems in the same setting, and is an important alternative in the management of duct stones."

In practice, only a few patients are cured but surgical resection, although feasible in less than 20% of patients, offers maximum prolongation of life and provides good palliation of symptoms. This can now be performed safely, even in elderly patients, in specialist units. Better radiological imaging and laparoscopy allow selection of resectable tumours effectively.

Staging by laparoscopy in pancreatic malignancy is an ideal strategy, with some operators able to complete a definitive laparoscopic palliative bypass in the same sitting. Intraoperative laparoscopic sonography is an advancing technique and has great potential in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis, hepatic metastases and staging of pancreatic cancer. Innovative options exist to deal with bile duct calculi, including antegrade sphincterotomy and intraoperative stent placement."

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography detected a stenosis of common bile duct at the hepatic hilum due to lymph nodal metastasis, and laparoscopy revealed peritoneal dissemination. Because the tumor was diagnosed as not for curative resection, the patient was treated by 4 courses of combination therapy with 5'-DFUR, MMC and CDDP. No adverse effect of chemotherapy was observed. As a result, lymph nodal metastasis and peritoneal dissemination were reduced. Curative intent total gastrectomy was performed, together with pancreatico-splenectomy, left hemicolectomy, cholecystectomy, and extended lymph nodal dissection.

CD009323,0,10837543,0,Local delivery of chemotherapy: a supplement to existing cancer treatments. A case for surgical pastes and coated stents.,"Local application or direct tumor injection of chemotherapeutic drugs has been proposed as a method by which local drug concentrations can be maximized in the immediate tumor environment while systemic exposure and non-target organ toxicity is minimized. Multiple opportunities are available to combine local drug delivery with widely practised, existing medical and surgical therapies. Surgical interventions, including both open and laparoscopic procedures, allow the physician to directly visualize and manipulate pathological tissues. Intraoperative placement of implantable therapeutic compounds (barriers to prevent adhesions, sustained-release antibiotics, tissue 'glues' and hemostatic agents) at or near the disease site is increasingly common in surgical practice. Less invasive therapies assisted by diagnostic imaging (fluoroscopy, ultrasound, CT and MRI scanning) have made accurate needle or catheter placement for drainage (abscesses, cysts, obstructions), injection (contrast media, pharmacological agents, embolic agents) and therapeutic purposes (endoluminal stents, venous filters) widely practised interventional medical procedures. This article describes a chemotherapeutic polymer-based paste we have developed for application at the time of surgery to reduce local recurrence of disease at tumor resection sites and a chemotherapeutic polymer-coated stent for use in the palliative management of malignant obstruction to improve the effective lifespan of the device (e.g., esophageal, biliary, prostate, and pulmonary disease). Despite the growth of local therapy in other disease states, regional cytotoxic drug therapy has not been widely deployed in the management of malignancy due to a clinical bias that local therapy will have limited utility in what is considered to be a systemic disease. In the above manner, local drug delivery could be incorporated into therapeutic protocols designed to enhance, not replace, the efficacy of existing treatment options."

Its presence is an important anatomic feature that helps distinguish between cystic duct and common hepatic duct, thus diminishing the risk of inadvertent bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,9876678,0,Mirizzi syndrome type II: is laparoscopic cholecystectomy justified?,"Mirizzi syndrome type II is an uncommon cause of obstructive jaundice caused by an inflammatory response to an impacted gallstone in Hartmann's pouch or the cystic duct with a resultant cholecystocholedochal fistula. Two cases of Mirizzi syndrome type II are presented. Clinically only one patient had jaundice and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) established a preoperative diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome. The other patient's diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome was made intraoperatively. It is important to properly identify the anatomy at the time of surgery to avoid compromising the common bile duct. Operative treatment of Mirizzi syndrome type II includes laparoscopic or open subtotal cholecystectomy; placement of a T-tube with either laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy; or creation of a hepaticojejunostomy with cholecystectomy. Although there is a report of laparoscopic treatment of this syndrome without long term follow-up, we believe that once there is any question of injury to the common bile duct, safety demands that the laparoscopic procedure be converted to an open one with implementation of appropriate therapy."

Source of referral, protocol for patient management, and operative strategy are outlined. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic sphincterotomy, and stent placement where possible (85% of cases), high-resolution contrast-enhanced CT and standard pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with a unique reconstructive technique were employed. In 105 patients receiving curative resection for pancreatic or periampullary tumours, the overall operative mortality was 4.8% and overall morbidity 26%. Actuarial 5-year survival rates were 11% for pancreatic carcinoma and 34% for ampullary carcinoma. Resectability rate was 81% without the use of time-consuming and expensive imaging techniques for staging such as laparoscopy, intraoperative ultrasound or laparoscopic ultrasound. No specific regimen of perioperative chemoirradiation was utilised over the study period. To achieve comparable results it is recommended that patients should be referred to regional specialist surgeons in whose hands mortality and morbidity is low, costs reduced and training of pancreatic surgeons can be undertaken."

In Group 1, bile leaks were at the level of the cystic duct in 10 patients and from a duct of Luschka in 1 patient; 10 patients had sphincterotomy and 11 patients received barbed stents. All patients had resolution of bile leak and stents were removed after an average of 5 weeks. In Group 2, stenoses were at the level of the common bile duct (CBD) in 7 patients and of the CBD-common hepatic duct in 1 patient. Six patients had a sphincterotomy and 7 patients were successfully treated with pneumatic polyethylene balloon dilatation and stent placement. One patient had unsatisfactory dilatation and was referred to surgery. Two patients had permanent resolution of stenosis at 3 and 4 years of follow-up, 5 patients had recurrence, and a total of 6 patients eventually needed surgery. We conclude that ERCP is effective in resolving isolated bile leaks, but iatrogenic strictures after LC more often require surgical treatment after ERCP."

CD009323,0,9208958,1,Staging laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasonography: optimizing resectability in hepatobiliary and pancreatic malignancy.,"Open laparotomy has traditionally been required to stage hepatobiliary and pancreatic (HBP) cancers accurately. For unresectable patients, costs and morbidity have been high. Today, laparoscopy alone or combined with laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) is being examined for its value in defining the extent of malignancy."
CD009323,0,9202539,1,Multimodality staging optimizes resectability in patients with pancreatic and ampullary cancer.,"Few patients with pancreatic cancer have resectable disease at the time of diagnosis, and a variety of nonsurgical techniques are available to provide effective palliation of jaundice and pain. Accurate preoperative staging is essential to identify patients with unresectable disease, thereby minimizing unnecessary surgery. Currently used diagnostic tests include contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT), visceral angiography, endoscopic ultrasound, and laparoscopy, but their utility remains controversial. To evaluate the accuracy of these various diagnostic tests, 30 consecutive patients with histologically proven pancreatic or ampullary adenocarcinoma treated between 1992 and 1996 were evaluated. All 30 patients had contrast-enhanced CT and laparoscopy, 22 patients (73%) had visceral angiography, and 16 patients (53%) had endoscopic ultrasound. Individual and combined predictive values of resectability and unresectability as well as the sensitivities and specificities were determined for all diagnostic tests and compared with intraoperative findings. When CT, visceral angiography, and laparoscopy were combined, the predictive values of resectability and unresectability were 75 and 90 per cent, respectively, with a sensitivity of 75 per cent and a specificity of 90 per cent. Therefore, the combined use of selected diagnostic tests proved more effective than any single diagnostic test for accurately staging patients with pancreatic head and ampullary cancers and should be considered to minimize unnecessary surgery."
CD009323,0,10401148,0,"Laparoscopic Intraoperative Ultrasonography, Color Doppler, and Power Flow Application.","The applications of color Doppler and power flow imaging for laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasonography (LIOU) are discussed. Basic principles concerning Doppler, color Doppler imaging (CDI), and power flow (PF) are briefly reviewed, and a number of representative examples of imaging are provided. LIOU is progressively gaining importance, not only for screening of the biliary tract, but in particular, for staging laparoscopy in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. The CDI technology that was developed relatively quickly is now in widespread use in diagnostic ultrasound, particularly for vascular surgery. CD options are no longer restricted to the expensive high-end ultrasound scanners, but are available in the majority of modest duplex systems with limited additional costs. Ongoing developments in ultrasound technology have resulted in the introduction of an alternative option to mean frequency-based CD ultrasound, ie, the PF. There are several advantages that emanate from the combination of B-mode ultrasound with CDI and/or PF. These include (1) rapid identification of anatomical structures, ie, vessels, ducts, tissue spaces, and cysts; (2) detection of small vessels that are difficult or impossible to recognize by B-mode scanning alone; (3) more accurate assessment of vascular encasement/involvement by tumor and a precise display of major vessels anatomically related to the tumor; (4) real-time guidance for safe parenchymal dissection of solid organs with identification and preservation of blood supply; (5) precise guided needle biopsy or puncture; and (6) visualization of bile flow in common bile by PF. This has the potential to enable dynamic flow studies of the function of the papilla of Vater in the near future."
CD009323,0,9448124,0,Chief resident experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Resident competence in both open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has been a concern among general surgeons. Laparoscopic surgery was late in coming at many surgical residency programs in the United States, and many residents have graduated with limited experience in LC. We are chief residents who were fortunate enough to start our training when LC was first introduced at our institution in 1990. This report summarizes our experience with LC in our chief year, during which we performed LC on 147 patients. The average operating time was 37 minutes (range, 12-82 minutes). Six patients (4%) required conversion to an open procedure. There were three complications (2 postoperative cystic duct leaks and 1 intraoperative common bile duct injury) for an overall complication rate of 2%. There was no mortality. It is our conclusion that graduating chief residents with 5 years' exposure to LC may perform the procedure with a complication rate comparable to that reported in the current literature. Insuring that graduating chief residents have adequate training in open cholecystectomy may become a more pressing issue in the near future."

CD009323,0,9195411,0,How to apply modern scientific and technological advances to the practice of clinical gastroenterology in Vietnam.,"There are some differences between the spectrum of gastroenterological diseases in Vietnam compared with those of more developed countries. These may be due to different living standards, quality of nutrition, and different infection rates of intestinal parasites and hepatotropic viruses. Gastric carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are leading malignancies, while colorectal cancer is less frequent. Bile duct stones often have Ascaris eggs in the centre, and they prevail in incidence over gall-bladder stones. The majority of digestive cancers are detected at a very late stage. The Vietnamese Association of Gastroenterology aims to contribute to the development of modern gastroenterology (GE) in Vietnam, to study and apply recent advances in imaging technology, such as fibre-optic diagnostic and therapeutical endoscopy, ultrasonography, laparoscopic surgery etc. and to do further work in molecular biology. For this purpose, besides our self-reliance, we need, and ask for, support and assistance from the Japanese Society of GE (JSGE), the Asian Pacific Association of GE (APAGE) and the Organisation Mondiale de GE (OMEGE). At the same time, we suggest a choice be made among the different technologies, bearing in mind their cost-effectiveness, and to give preference to measures for the primary prevention and early detection of the diseases. Japanese experience in the early detection of gastric cancer and HCC, and in the Percutaneous Ethanol Injection Therapy (PEIT) for treatment of HCC, are highly appreciated. We recommend also a judicious and scientific combination of traditional medicine and modern technology in the research and the struggle against digestive diseases."
CD009323,0,9194293,0,Double cystic duct found by intraoperative cholangiography in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"We report a rare case of double cystic duct in a 74-year-old woman. The patient complained of mild epigastric discomfort, and several stones were discovered by ultrasonography and computed tomography. Any anomalies of the biliary tract were undetectable in the preoperative examinations without direct cholangiography. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. After clipping the cystic duct close to the gallbladder, as usual, serial intraoperative cholangiography was performed and unexpectedly showed the inflow of contrast medium into the gallbladder via another cystic duct arising from the right hepatic duct, thus revealing one gallbladder and two cystic ducts, one of which joined the common hepatic duct and the other the right hepatic duct. There was only one cystic artery that arose from the right hepatic artery and accompanied the primary cystic duct to be distributed to the gallbladder. The existence of contrast medium in the resected specimen was confirmed by radiography. No complications occurred during or after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This is the first report of double cystic duct found in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We recommend routine preoperative or intraoperative cholangiography."

We designed a laparoscopically assisted approach that appears to meet the need. The proximal jejunum is exteriorized by laparoscopy via an epigastric trocar-site incision. An EEA anvil is installed in the exteriorized jejunum, which is returned to the abdomen. Through this mini-incision, the anterior wall of the stomach is opened for insertion of the EEA stapler, which penetrates the posterior gastric wall. When snapped to the anvil and fired, an antecolic gastrojejunostomy is created. No mortality or anastomotic leak occurred in two cases. The operation and recovery appeared to be faster than historic controls. This operation is minimally invasive and expeditious, ideal for patients requiring palliative bypass."

Fluoroscopy is usually employed, and chronic exposure to X-ray, in spite of the relative low dose, can lead to potentially unhealthy conditions such as malignancies like bone marrow and other solid cancers. A median of 18 years of life is lost per fatal cancer, including the time of latency since exposure. Nor should one forget benign condition such as cataracts that can lead to partial or complete blindness and which surely impair life's quality."
CD009323,0,9244986,0,[Surgery in malignant obstructive jaundice: laparoscopic surgery--the future?].,"The systematic staging of pancreatic cancer has facilitated exact evaluation of a patient's prognosis in recent years. Minimally invasive surgery, on the other hand, has produced new procedures which necessitate a distinct dichotomy between open, curative surgery and minimally invasive, palliative procedures. Diagnostic modalities facilitating an accurate assessment of resectability have to be found. Preoperative imaging and endoscopic techniques are only successful in about 50% of cases. Diagnostic laparoscopy is the only method for visualization of peritoneal metastases. The use of diagnostic laparoscopy and laparoscopic sonography raise the accuracy concerning resectability from 20% to between 75% and 100%. 33% up to 67% of patients deemed resectable by preoperative imaging show signs of unresectable cancer at laparoscopy and can be spared an unnecessary laparotomy. For these patients a choice of laparoscopic or endoscopic bypass techniques is available. The laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy without sutures developed in Zurich has proven to be efficient in animal trials and will soon be implemented in clinical trials. A differentiated indication for laparoscopic bypass techniques and endoscopic stenting is necessary. The laparoscopic procedures should be employed in patients with a risk of duodenal obstruction or a projected mean survival of more than 6 months (stage III), while endoscopic stenting has already been established in the treatment of patients with a survival of less than 6 months (stage IV)."
CD009323,0,9834354,0,The role of laparoscopy in the preoperative staging of pancreatic carcinoma.,"Between January 1990 and December 1995, a total of 398 patients underwent laparotomy for pancreatic or periampullary carcinoma at the Surgical Clinic of Mannheim. The tumor was located in the pancreatic head in 290 patients (72.9%), in the body of the pancreas in 42 patients (10.6%), and in the pancreatic tail in 19 patients (4.7%). Forty-seven patients (11.8%) presented with periampullary carcinoma. The preoperative diagnostic workup included abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and angiography. One hundred seventy-two patients (43.2%) underwent a tumor resection, 150 (37.7%) had a palliative bypass operation, and 76 (19.1%) underwent only an exploratory laparotomy. Preoperative diagnosis had predicted unresectability in 66 (87%) of the patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy. In 76 patients the intraoperative findings showed an unresectable tumor, which was located in the head of the pancreas in 54 cases (71%), in the body of the pancreas in 17 (22.4%), in the tail region in four (5.3%), and in the periampullary region in one (1.3%). Local signs of unresectability were found in 47 patients (62%) and peritoneal or hepatic metastases in 29 (28.2%). Given that local inoperability can be reliably assessed only at laparotomy, this leaves just 29 (7%) of 398 patients who did not require palliation and whose signs of unresectability could possibly have been discovered by means of the laparoscopic approach. Laparoscopy (including laparoscopic ultrasound) should be used selectively in patients considered probably unresectable who do not require a palliative procedure immediately before the planned operation."
CD009323,0,9834353,1,The role of laparoscopy in the management of suspected pancreatic and periampullary malignancies.,"Laparoscopic evaluation of patients with suspected periampullary malignancies has been utilized more frequently in recent years. Its exact role with regard to staging and surgical bypass for palliation have yet to be clearly defined. To better define the role of laparoscopy in the evaluation and palliation of periampullary malignancy, a retrospective review of the Duke experience was carried out. Fifty-three patients with suspected pancreatic or periampullary malignancies were referred for surgical evaluation at Duke University Medical Center between 1993 and 1995. All patients underwent CT scanning and lesions were classified as resectable or unresectable based on previously established criteria. Patients either underwent laparoscopic evaluation (n = 30; 11 with laparoscopic palliation) or proceeded directly to celiotomy (n = 23). Charts were reviewed for postoperative course including complications, length of stay, and hospital costs. Although laparoscopy had a sensitivity of 93.3% for metastatic disease, CT scans accurately staged 86.8% of patients missing only one patient with peritoneal/hepatic disease. Based on these results, laparoscopy may not be beneficial for every patient with a suspected pancreatic malignancy. Retrospectively an attempt was made to determine which patients benefited from laparoscopy and which patients are best served by proceeding directly to open exploration. From these data we devised an algorithm that outlines an efficient and cost-effective approach for this patient population."
CD009323,0,9333452,0,[Gastrointestinal problems in elderly patients].,"The following article contains a short review on gastrointestinal problems of the elderly. The diseases of the esophagus occurring in the elderly are not much different from those in younger patients. Clinically relevant in the stomach are above all bleeding ulcerations and the gastric carcinoma occurring more frequently in advanced age. The pyogenic liver abscess is diagnosed primarily in the elderly and is at a rule the consequence of an infection of the gall bladder and other abdominal sites. The hepatocellular carcinoma does not grow rapidly in the elderly, but its accompanying unfavourable survival rate at five years is also approximately 5 per cent. In the case of symptomatic cholelithiasis, older high risk patients do especially profit from minimally invasive laparoscopic surgical procedures. Today, bile duct calculi are preferably treated by endoscopic papillotomy and following extraction of the calculi. The pancreas is subjected to atrophy, lipomatosis and fibrosis at the advanced age. However, these changes are rarely of clinical relevance. A frequent problem in clinical practice is that of constipation, from which 35% of patients suffer above the age of 65 years. Another typical symptom of the elderly is the incontinence, the different causes are being discussed. In advanced age, gastrointestinal hemorrhages are mostly occurring above the Treitz's ligament. Hemorrhages of the lower gastrointestinal tract occur mostly in the form of diverticle bleedings and those of angiodysplasias in the elderly. The diverticulosis is also a disease observed in over 50 per cent of patients above 70 years, but it is symptomatic in only part of the patients. When suspecting an inflammatory bowel disease in the elderly, the possibility of a mesenterial ischemia must always be considered as differential diagnosis. The classical chronic inflammatory bowel diseases can, however, also occur at advanced age. The colon carcinoma is one of the most frequent lethal causes in the Western countries 90 per cent of the cases of colon carcinoma are found in patients older than 50 years of age. Intensive attention is therefore required in this age group."
CD009323,0,9153182,0,Gallbladder and cystic duct absence. An infrequent malformation in laparoscopic surgery.,"Gallbladder absence is an infrequent anomaly normally accompanied by lack of the cystic duct. Of unknown etiology, in general it is accepted to be a congenital malformation. A male patient (age 59) diagnosed with nonfunctional symptomatic scleroatrophic gallbladder by echography and ERCP was operated on using a laparoscopic approach. Gallbladder and cystic absence was diagnosed during the procedure. A new case of gallbladder and cystic duct absence, diagnosed by laparoscopy, is presented. This type of extrahepatic bile duct malformation is quite rare, but it must be taken into account due to the generalization of laparoscopic surgery in biliar pathology because of the high risk of serious lesions to the hepatocholedochal system."
CD009323,0,9143059,0,Brachytherapy and pancreatic cancer.,"Advances in diagnostic and therapeutic technology have not appreciably changed the outlook of patients with pancreatic cancer. While those patients presenting with localized resectable disease have the best prognosis, local control and intra-abdominal metastases remain significant obstacles to survival. Localized chemoradiation has modestly improved median survival in localized and locally advanced disease. Patients presenting with locally advanced disease at diagnosis benefit from surgical palliation which includes biliary and gastric bypass. Intraoperative interstitial brachytherapy has been effective when utilized at laparotomy to improve local control in locally advanced disease. Advances in laparoscopic techniques have provided the ability to more accurately stage patients prior to laparotomy and perform palliative procedures without the need for laparotomy. The utilization of high-dose-rate brachytherapy has proven effective in palliating obstructive symptoms with minimal morbidity on an outpatient basis. Recent efforts have focused on preoperative chemoradiation to improve resectability in selected patients and prophylactic hepatic irradiation to reduce metastases for patients with locally advanced disease."

This second-year study retrospectively examined all cholecystectomy records in one city at each of five hospitals over a 1-year period beginning in April 1991 through March 1992. All charts were examined for type of surgery, rate of conversion to open procedure, sex, weight, previous abdominal surgery, surgeon, hospital, preoperative workup, operative time, antibiotic prophylaxis, cholangiograms, concurrent procedures, drains, hospital stay, common duct stones and their follow-up, pathology, reoperations, complications, and mortality. One thousand eight hundred one gallbladders were removed. One thousand three hundred four (72.4%) were successfully removed at LC. One hundred eighty-three (10.2%) others were attempted laparoscopically and converted to open cholecystectomy (CC), which represented 12.3% of the attempted LCs. Three hundred fourteen (17.4%) were removed via a standard OC. The mean operative times were 72.3 minutes for LC, 100.1 minutes for CC, and 86.2 minutes for OC. Cholangiography was attempted in 916 (70.3%) LCs, 144 (78.7%) CCs, and 250 (79.6%) OCs, with similar operative times, except in LC, when done via the GB, operative time was 65.2 versus 73.4 minutes when done via the cystic duct. Diagnosis of acute cholecystitis occurred in 306 (23.5%) LCs, 119 (65.0%) CCs, and 145 (46.2%) OCs. Complications requiring reoperation occurred in 30 (2.3%) LCs, 5 (2.7%) CCs, and 5 (1.6%) OCs. Common bile duct (CBD) injuries occurred in 5 (34%) LCs, with 4 converted to CC and 1 repaired 5 days later. Trocar site hernias occurred in 11 (0.8%) LCs. Thirty-nine surgeons participated in the study with mean numbers of 33.4 LC cases, 5.5 CC cases, and 7.2 OC cases, with ranges of 1 to 165 LC cases, 1 to 17 CC cases, and 1 to 24 OC cases. Death occurred in 12 (0.9%) LC cases, 4 (2.2%) CC cases, and 25 (8.0%) OC cases. The mean hospital stay was 39.6 hours for LC, 156.5 hours for CC, and 198.3 hours for OC."

The authors used it in 54 of 194 patients submitted to a CVL, always making use of the trans-cystic access, with a percentage of success of 82.6%. It was not possible in 8 patients due to the complete section of the cystic duct during the work (3 cases) and the impossibility of introducing the catheter (5 cases). There is still no common agreement about the opportunity to use IC daily: the authors think selective use is better preceded by a careful clinical laboratory instrumental preoperative study to find patients with the common duct stone. Besides, they are of the opinion that a rigorous surgical technique is fundamental to reduce the lesions of the VBP that there are not in their experience."

There is evidence that radical resection can prolong survival, especially for locally advanced (> or = PT2, according to the Union International Centre Cancer pathologic T classification) lesions. Case reports of recurrence at port sites after laparoscopic cholecystectomy add another aspect to the management difficulty. A 64-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary colic. Histologic evaluation revealed an incidental adenocarcinoma, stage pT3. Radical resection with curative intent occurred 11 days later, including mesohepatectomy, skeletonization resection of the common bile duct with en bloc lymph node dissection, and bilateral Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomies. There was no tumor identified in the re-excision specimen (T3N0M0). At 7-month follow-up, the patient presented with nodules in the right subcostal area and in the periumbilical incision. Positron emission tomography demonstrated carcinoma at both sites. Biopsy confirmed metastatic gallbladder carcinoma. This case emphasizes the significance of tumor seeding at port sites during laparoscopy. An open technique is indicated if carcinoma is suspected. To avoid dissemination of unsuspected carcinoma during routine laparoscopic procedures, isolation techniques must be applied. The benefit of radical resection was clearly thwarted in this case, and resection of port sites at the time of reoperation is warranted. Finally, positron emission tomography scan is useful in delineating the recurrence of gallbladder carcinoma and its extent."

CD009323,0,10401139,0,Laparoscopic Common Bile Duct Bypass Procedures.,The vast majority of benign obstructive processes of the biliary tract can be handled by simple clearance of the common bile duct. Malignant disease and complicated biliary tract problems may require a stenting procedure or a bypass of the obstructed segment. Most general surgeons have been trained to perform one of a number of bypass procedures of the biliary tract but the advent of laparoscopy has diminished the frequency with which many surgeons have the opportunity to perform this type of surgery. This section discusses several laparoscopic bypass procedures that have been highly successful in our hands as well as the results of our series.
CD009323,0,10401135,0,Techniques and Cost of Common Bile Duct Exploration.,"The introduction of laparoscopic techniques to treat biliary tract disease in the last decade heralded the beginning of a new age of surgery where strong emphasis is placed not only on the efficacy of the operation, but at least as importantly on the ""side effects"" of surgical intervention. Thus, the focus has recently centered on the application of minimally invasive and minimally damaging techniques to perform operations that heretofore had required laparotomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) itself is an excellent example of a procedure that produces an equivalent disease-related treatment endpoint, without the morbidity of previous ""open"" techniques. Laparoscopic treatment of common bile duct stones, while technically much more difficult than cholecystectomy, offers the same minimally invasive benefits to the patient without the necessity of laparotomy or secondary procedures such as endoscopic retrograde choledocholithotomy or sphincterotomy. Numerous techniques for laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCDE) have been developed. Each of them accesses the stones by one of two routes: through the cystic duct or through a choledochotomy. Both approaches are associated with equivalent success rates in removing stones, but the transcystic approach has the added benefit of being truly minimally invasive, as compared with choledochotomy. This report reviews the current state of the art of the transcystic approach to the laparoscopic treatment of choledocholithiasis."

CD009323,0,9045463,0,[Resectability of papillary and pancreatic cancer assessed by ultrasonography and computer tomography].,"A retrospective study of 65 patients with postoperatively verified pancreatic or peripancreatic cancer was conducted. Before surgery all patients had ultrasonography (US) performed, and 46 patients had computed tomography (CT) performed as well. After operation description of pre-operative radiological findings has been compared to description of operative and pathological findings. Three of the 65 patients were excluded either because of lacking radiological descriptions (two patients) or uncertain operative findings (one patient). When both investigations were performed, they were carried out independently by two skilled radiologists without knowledge of the result of the other investigations. The following criteria were used for non-resectability encasement of splanchnic vessels, liver metastases, peritoneal thickening with ascites, and glandular enlargement. As assessed by US, 15 of 16 (94%) were truly predicted to be non-resectable, whereas only 21 of 38 (55%) were truly predicted resectable. CT was performed in 46 patients of which 19 of 21 (90%) were truly predicted non-resectable, and 17 of 21 (81%) were truly predicted resectable. It was not possible to perform a conclusive radiological investigation in eight of 62 (13%) cases by US, and four of 46 (9%) cases by CT. One patient was falsely predicted non-resectable by US and an additional one by CT. Both were falsely predicted non-resectable on suspicion of vessel involvement. Overall, invasion of vessels was the most common cause for non-resectability, at the same time this was the index of non-resectability that was most often not detected pre-operatively. US is reliable when predicting non-resectability. When resectable tumour is detected by US, supplementary investigations such as CT should be applied, and when necessary endoscopic procedures or laparoscopy as well. Hereby unnecessary laparotomies may be avoided. Care should be taken when suspecting papillary tumour; only 66% of these were detected by either of the two methods."

CD009323,0,9116939,0,Laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy for advanced thoracic esophageal cancer.,"We performed transhiatal subtotal esophagectomy under laparoscopic guidance to reduce the invasiveness of subtotal esophagectomy while preserving dissectional accuracy. In six cases of advanced thoracic esophageal cancer with distant metastasis, we used a special type of handpiece of ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) for laparoscopic surgery to dissect the esophagus from surrounding tissues and to isolate vessels entering it while viewing with the video monitor. Hemostasis of isolated vessels was effected by clips or electrocoagulation. There was no massive bleeding from the mediastinum during the operation, nor was there postoperative bleeding or infection. All patients regained normal swallowing ability and were discharged. Transhiatal esophagectomy under laparoscopic guidance is considered a safe, less invasive operative treatment for patients who are suffering from advanced thoracic esophageal cancer."
CD009323,0,9103705,0,Imaging of gallbladder and biliary tract before laparoscopic cholecystectomy: comparison of intravenous cholangiography and the combined use of HASTE and single-shot RARE MR imaging.,"To compare intravenous cholangiography (i.v.c.) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as preoperative imaging techniques in patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Twenty patients underwent i.v.c. and MRI, 40 axial 'localizer' images were first obtained with a half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin echo (HASTE) sequence. Next, an extremely high T2-weighted rapid acquisition relaxation enhancement (RARE) acquisition (TE = 1100 msec) was used for MR cholangiography. All images obtained with i.v.c. and MRI were independently analyzed by two observers. The relative visibility of the (normal or abnormal) gallbladder (GB), cystic duct (CD), and bile ducts (BD) on both types of images was scored as follows: 1 = MRI better than i.v.c.; 2 = no difference; 3 = i.v.c. better than MRI. We observed 3 anatomic variants: 1 of the cystic duct and 2 of the intrahepatic bile ducts; 15 patients had gallstones; one had cholecystitis. Magnetic resonance images were considered more informative than i.v.c.-images for visualization of GB in 11 patients (55%), for CD in 9 patients (45%), and in 8 patients (40%) for visualization of the CBD. Intravenous cholangiography outperformed MRI in the evaluation of the CBD and CD in one patient (5%). The combined use of half-Fourier single-shot RARE and high T2-weighted RARE MR imaging is a valuable alternative to i.v.c. in the preoperative evaluation of gallbladder and biliary tract."

CD009323,0,9069142,0,Comparison of bile duct pressures following sphincterotomy and endobiliary stenting in a canine model.,Cystic duct (CD) leaks following laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be diagnosed and managed with ERCP. Treatment options include endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) and/or endobiliary stenting (Stent). This study was undertaken to determine if ES or Stent is more effective in lowering bile duct pressures by disrupting the pressure gradient created by the sphincter of Oddi and therefore more beneficial in the management of CD.

CD009323,0,9044114,0,Multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of pediatric pancreaticobiliary disorders.,"A multidisciplinary approach using traditional open surgery, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and laparoscopic surgery has revolutionized the care of the adult with pancreaticobiliary disease. This study focuses on a similar collaborative effort to diagnose and treat children with pancreaticobiliary disorders. Charts of all patients treated on the pediatric surgery service between June 1990 and May 1995, who also underwent ERCP, were abstracted for disease process, presenting symptoms, laboratory evaluation, surgical or endoscopic procedures, and eventual outcome. Twenty-six children were identified, ranging from 6 months to 19 years of age. Pancreaticobiliary disorders included pancreas divisum (n = 1), choledochal cyst (n = 4), pancreaticobiliary trauma (n = 4), cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis (n = 17). The pancreaticobiliary tree was successfully visualized by ERCP in 25 of 26 (96%) patients. Fifteen of these patients also underwent attempted therapeutic endoscopic procedures, with 13 (87%) performed successfully. Three patients with choledochal cyst had stents placed preoperatively for cholangitis, all of whom have undergone successful choledochal cyst excision. Two trauma patients underwent attempted stenting of a bile leak and bile duct stricture, respectively, both of which were unsuccessful, necessitating surgical correction. Seventeen patients with cholelithiasis underwent ERCP to rule out choledocholithiasis. Ten patients were found to have common duct stones, and all stones were endoscopically extracted, including those in a 6-month-old child. Overall survival rate was 96% (25 of 26), with the one death occurring in a trauma patient unrelated to his pancreaticobiliary disorder. A multidisciplinary approach using traditional open surgery, ERCP and laparoscopic surgery can successfully treat even young children with pancreaticobiliary disorders. In experienced hands, diagnostic ERCP and therapeutic endoscopic intervention can be performed successfully in most pediatric patients, greatly simplifying the surgical management of these potentially complex problems."
CD009323,0,9034442,0,Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy procedures in a rural hospital.,"Laparoscopic surgical procedures are replacing traditional, more invasive surgical procedures--even in small, rural hospitals. During a period of 12 months, the authors performed laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy procedures on two patients at a 20-bed hospital in North Dakota. Although surgeons in other countries have reported performing laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy procedures, this is the first published report of a US surgical team performing this procedure. Laparoscopic dissection of the distal pancreas allows preservation of patients' spleens, decreases postoperative pain and length of hospitalization, and permits patients to return to activities of daily living more quickly than with traditional open pancreatectomy procedures."
CD009323,0,9012424,0,Common duct exploration during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Management of a common duct stone detected during laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains controversial. Although endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy is a procedure preferred by many authors, it has a reported 15 per cent reported morbidity, 1 per cent mortality, 5 per cent failure rate, and 5 per cent incidence of late ampullary stenosis. Cystic duct dilatation with the introduction of a choledoscope and a basket remains an alternative but has a risk of a common duct tear and difficulty in manipulation of instrument should the cystic duct enter the common duct at an angle, and it causes difficulty in extraction of larger stones. In our experience, a choledochotomy with removal of stones during the laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a satisfactory direct approach. We reviewed all of the cholecystectomies performed in the regional hospital since the introduction of the laparoscopic technique. There were 425 cases of laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed with cholangiography, with detection of a stone in 11 patients. In these patients, choledochotomies were performed by making an incision on the anterior surface of the common duct using scissors. The cystic duct should not be divided following cholangiography since provided traction. Following exploration using a Fogarty catheter, a T tube was placed, and a T tube cholangiogram was performed prior to its removal. With this technique, we successfully removed the stones in 10 cases. In one, an impacted stone was removed in the X-Ray Department, 6 weeks postoperative and enables cholecystectomy and bile duct stones to be removed in one session with no increase in morbidity or mortality."
CD009323,0,16160955,0,Intraoperative ultrasonography of the pancreas: techniques and clinical applications.,"Intraoperative ultrasound of the pancreas is a dynamic clinical diagnostic field providing crucial information to the surgeon at the time of exploration, and impacting on clinical management decisions and choices of surgical techniques. It is a rapid and effective technique for imaging the entire pancreas, differentiating normal from pathological processes, imaging the pancreatic and common bile ducts, and demonstrating the exact relationship between pathological processes of the pancreas and the adjacent arterial and venous structures, the common bile duct, and the duodenal wall. The demand for intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) of the pancreas is expected to increase, particularly as management algorithms become accepted clinical practice, due to advances in intraoperative tumor ablation and radiotherapeutic techniques, as well as technical improvements in laparoscopic ultrasound methods and instrumentation. Not only is IOUS of the pancreas becoming a recognized modality for visualizing and characterizing solid and cystic lesions of the pancreas, but it also has superior lesion detection rates over other non-invasive preoperative imaging modalities. Provisional studies from our department suggest that data from IOUS significantly affects surgical decision making."
CD009323,0,9876647,0,Comparison of outpatient laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a private nonteaching hospital versus a private teaching community hospital.,"The development of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has allowed the introduction of outpatient surgery for biliary tract disease. However, there appears to be a wide variation of the interpretation of ""outpatient surgery,"" ranging from discharge the same day to keeping patients for overnight observation. We prospectively reviewed the last 50 chole-cystectomies performed at Spartanburg Regional Medical Center, a private teaching institution, and Upstate Carolina Medical Center, a private nonteaching hospital. All cholecystectomies were performed by board certified surgeons or surgical residents under the supervision of board certified surgeons. Spartanburg Regional Medical Center's standard was 23-hour observation with 9 patients (18%) being discharged home the day of surgery. Upstate Carolina Medical Center's standard was discharge home (usually 4-8 hours after completion of the procedure) with 39 patients (78%) discharged the same day. No patient discharged the same day presented back with any significant complication. Comorbid disease, biliary pancreatitis, ascending cholangitis, gangrenous gallbladder, extreme age and living conditions and conversion to open were factors considered for admission. Intra-operative difficulty such as oozing, excessive adhesiolysis, postoperative nausea, vomiting or pain control were also indications for overnight admissions. The extra 15 to 19 hours for routine observation did not change any treatment for any of the 41 patients and resulted in additional cost to the hospital of approximately $15,000. We conclude that same day, outpatient laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be done safely with discharge home 4 to 8 hours postoperative without significant morbidity in selective patients."
CD009323,0,9876641,0,One thousand and six consecutive laparoscopic intraoperative cholangiograms.,"Intraoperative cholangiography was successfully performed in 1,000 out of 1,006 attempts in 1019 consecutive cholecystectomies. There were 783 chronic, 95 acute, 61 fibrotic, 27 gangrenous and 40 cases of hydrops of the gallbladder in those laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed. unsuspected common duct stones were identified in 5% of the patients. There were no injuries resulting from intraoperative cholangiography performed via the cystic duct. In this large series, routine cholangiography was thought to be helpful in the prevention of common bile duct injuries and the establishment of abnormal anatomy. In non-acute cholecystitis, intraoperative cholangiography is necessary due to the importance of abnormal anatomy verification. The technique of laparoscopic cholecystectomy differs greatly from that of open technique, and, therefore, routine intraoperative cholangiography is strongly advised."
CD009323,0,9834326,0,Laparoscopic pancreatic resection: Is it worthwhile?,"A series of 23 patients who had undergone an attempted laparoscopic Whipple (n = 10) or laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (n = 9) or laparoscopic enucleation (n = 4) since January 1992 were retrospectively reviewed. In the laparoscopic Whipple group (6 women and 4 men; mean age 71 [range 33 to 82] years), eight had malignant periampullary tumors and two had chronic pancreatitis. The rate of conversion to an open procedure was 40%, and complications were seen in the nonconverted group. The average operative time was 8.5 hours, and the hospital stay was 22.3 days. However, in the laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and enucleation groups, there were seven women and six men (mean age 46.5 [range 27 to 75] years). Of these, nine patients had a planned laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (8 for islet cell tumors and 1 for chronic pancreatitis) and four had a planned laparoscopic enucleation (all 4 for islet cell tumors). The conversion rate for these patients was 36%, and the mean operative time was 4.5 hours for laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and 3 hours for laparoscopic enucleation. The hospital stay was 5 days and 4 days, respectively. Although this series was small, no benefit seemed to be derived from the use of a complete laparoscopic Whipple procedure. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and enucleation were technically easier to perform and seemed to benefit patients by shortening their hospital stay with no recurrence of disease."

In 12 out of 13 patients with gastric outlet obstruction due to inoperable tumor of the upper GI tract (gastric, gallbladder or pancreas carcinoma). From the above, a total of 4 patients had postoperative complications (30.7%), three of which could be treated without further operation.

CD009323,0,9574186,1,[Efficacy and economic aspects of preoperative diagnosis: laparoscopy is useful in only 13% of patients with pancreatic carcinoma].,"The value of diagnostic laparoscopy to improve tumor staging in patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancer is still a matter of controversial discussion, especially with regard to whether diagnostic laparoscopy can identify patients in whom a laparotomy can be avoided due to metastases. To answer this question, all patients who underwent operations for pancreatic cancer (n = 97) or periampullary cancer (n = 30) between 11/1993 and 12/1995 were evaluated. Only 10% of the patients with periampullary/pancreatic cancer and 13% with pancreatic cancer could avoid laparotomy through diagnostic laparoscopy. Due to these low numbers, a diagnostic laparotomy cannot be recommended in general in patients with pancreatic and/or periampullary cancer on economic grounds and because of the risk of trocar metastases."

CD009323,0,9499530,0,[Value of intraoperative cholangiography in laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,"By introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, an increase of accidental common bile duct injuries up to 1.2% has been reported. In the present study of 325 cholecystectomies we evaluated whether mandatory intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) can reduce the rate of accidental bile duct injuries or, at least, identify them early in order to make an adequate repair possible. In addition 163 patients underwent preoperative intravenous cholangiography (IVC). Both imaging techniques were compared with regard to their sensitivity in the detection of anatomic variations and stones of the extrahepatic bile duct system. Our results demonstrated a great advantage of the IOC. The IOC was feasible in 98.1% of the cases and presented a complete depiction of the extrahepatic bile duct system in 99.3%. IVCs showed the biliary system in 91.4% of the cases but without visualization of the cystic duct in 51.5% and the hepatic confluence in 16%. Anatomic variations of the bile duct system which consecutively influenced the operative management were found in additional 27.6% exclusively by IOC. 71.4% of bile duct stones were not detected by IVC. The intraoperative time consumption of IOC was unimportant. The x-ray-load was clearly lower by a factor of 3.5. There was no complication after IOC. In comparison, 6.1% of patients demonstrated an anaphylactic reaction by IVC. One common duct injury (0.3%) was detected intraoperatively by IOC and at the same operation treated without postoperative complications. In conclusion, we recommend an IOC in addition to a thorough preoperative ultrasound-examination. By this technique intraoperatively identified stones of the common bile duct can be sufficiently treated by postoperative endoscopic extraction and anatomic variations of the bile duct system will be visualized and therefore accidental injuries will be avoided."
CD009323,0,9498200,0,[Preoperative diagnosis of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Is there an indication for routine intravenous cholangiography?].,"In a retrospective study including 163 patients we investigated the necessity of i.v. cholangiography in preoperative routine diagnostic workup prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We evaluated the evidence of i.v. cholangiography concerning the anatomy of the biliary system, the evidence of common bile duct or cystic duct stones and the influence on the further therapeutic procedure. While the common bile duct could be demonstrated in 96.3%, the cystic duct could be visualized in only 54.6%. One out of two patients with a short cystic duct was identified. Stones in the gallbladder were recognized in 72.4% of cases, while only two out of three patients with common bile duct stones were diagnosed. In nine cases a deep junction of the cystic duct was found, but there was no influence on further operative procedure. Thus we found no improvement after routine use of i.v. cholangiography concerning the evidence of common bile duct stones or avoidance of intraoperative lesions of the common bile duct. The routine use of i.v. cholangiography prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy is therefore not justified."
CD009323,0,9454494,0,[Suture of trocar puncture sites after laparoscopy].,"The suturing of port sites measuring at least 10 mm in diameter following laparoscopy can prevent the incarceration of small bowel and/or omentum and scar hernias. This means that all port sites remaining after using trocars of at least 10 mm need to be carefully closed by suturing. In the case of oncological procedures in particular, it is important to ensure that the bite of the suture needle includes the peritoneum, to avoid leaving a fresh peritoneal wound offering favourable conditions for the implantation of tumour cells. The technique described here for port site suturing involves all the layers of the abdominal wall, including the peritoneum, and may thus help to prevent port site metastases."

CD009323,0,9408381,0,The removal of cystic duct and gallbladder remnant by microlaparotomy.,"The so called ""Postcholecystectomy Syndrome"" may be due to various pathological biliary causes. While a very small number of patients may have symptoms attributable to problems related to cholecystectomy. Twenty five patients underwent a second operation on the bile ducts after cholecystectomy, cholecystostomy and choledocho-duodenostomy by micro and minilaparotomy between December 1990 and December 1996. The second most common causes for reexploration were cystic duct and gallbladder remnants (16%). After incomplete cholecystectomy they usually find that the cystic duct stump and the alot triangle embedded in inflamed scar tissue. For this reason the surgical risk is to high with laparoscopic surgery to reoperate for these pathological changes."

CD009323,0,9383346,0,The use of laparoscopic ultrasound in the assessment of pancreatic cancer.,"26 consecutive cases of obstructive jaundice due to a carcinoma of the head of the pancreas were studied prospectively with ultrasound (US), computerized tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS). Sensitivity of US, CT were comparable, although CT seems better to evaluate the size of the tumor and for lymph node detection. 50 percent of patients had a criterion for noncurative resection. EUS (16 cases) had the best sensitivity (100 percent) for the staging of small tumors (less than 20 mm), detection of adjacent nodes and the relation between tumors- and mesenteric and portal vein. EUS was not able to detect peritoneal and/or liver micro-metastases. The criterion for noncurative resection was 57.6%. LUS exactly assessed all tumors larger than 2 cm. The accuracy compared with EUS was not as good for small tumors, but better concerning micro-peritoneal or hepatic metastasis. The criterion for noncurative resection was 80.7 percent. These results suggest to use of US and CT as first-line procedures in the preoperative staging and assessment of resectability of pancreatic cancers. When the patient does not appear to have disseminated lesions, EUS gives a good estimation of the size of the tumor, node assessment and vascular relations. LUS could be the first step for a curative surgical treatment. LUS revelated to discover 15 to 30 percent of unknown micro-metastases and avoided useless laparotomy in these patients."
CD009323,0,9377518,0,Intraoperative and laparoscopic sonography of the liver.,"Intraoperative sonography is an important aid in the decision making process during open surgery because it can detect additional small liver tumours that may not be depicted preoperatively, even with the use of modern non invasive imaging modalities. A continued important role of intraoperative sonography is to determine hepatic anatomy, allowing for safer and easier hepatic surgery with increased parenchymal preservation. Intraoperative sonography is also used for monitoring cryogenic ablation of hepatic tumour. To overcome the inherent limitations of laparoscopic surgery, laparoscopic sonography can now be used to provide information not available during laparoscopy or laparoscopic surgery alone. In this article, the authors present the most recent techniques for intraoperative sonography. Also they emphasize the important role of intraoperative sonography and laparoscopic sonography in the surgical decision-making process in patients with hepatic or biliary disease and report the most recent advances in intraoperative sonography with respect to the treatment of hepatic tumours.

In view of the difficult anatomical situation in Calot's triangle, such patho-anatomical conditions when encountered during open surgery best dealt with by anterograde (prograde) dissection of the gallbladder beginning from the fundus and proceeding towards the neck of the gallbladder. Since this approach is considered to be safer and less risky, it should also be adopted during laparoscopic surgery. The advantage is to be seen in the initial dissection far removed from the bile ducts. Despite pronounced inflammatory changes and initial preservation of the cystic artery, the use of modern technologies permit a virtually bloodless procedure. Nevertheless, the difficult anatomical situation makes a high level of readiness to conver mandatory. Should there be any doubt, the open surgical approach is the safer modality."

Papillosphincterotomy with laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 50 patients, in 4 senile patients only papillosphincterotomy was performed. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and interventions on the common bile duct were fulfilled in 46 patients; in 27 cases the duct was drained by the method of Holsted-Pikovskiĭ, in 13 cases--after Kehr, in 3--after Vishnevskiĭ. In 2 cases the concrements were removed through the cystic duct, the common bile duct was not drained. The supraduodenal choledochoduodenoanastomosis was made in one patient. The open operation was performed in 4 cases (3.9%). One patient died (1%). The experience shows that the modern endoscopic technique allows the whole program of intraoperative revision and sanitation of the hepaticocholedochus and its drainage to be realized. Advantages of the combined endoscopic treatment of the cholelithic disease complicated by a lesion of the terminal part of the common bile duct as compared with traditional surgery are evident.

Complication rates were higher in cholecystitis (P = 0,02) but were similar according to the experience of the surgeon. These results, similar to those of a British independent audit suggest than conversion and complication rates are higher than those reported in most of the multicentre studies.

This experience confirms that in elderly patients the treatment of choice for cholelithiasis is cholecystectomy and for acute colecystitis is early cholecistectomy. The preferred treatment of choledocholithiasis and severe acute biliary pancreatitis is endoscopic sphincterectomy. Endoscopic or radiologic drainages are the choice for acute biliary pancreatitis. In conclusion elderly patients with surgical biliary problems should be treated by a surgical, endoscopic and radiological team, taking in account all the available procedures."
CD009323,0,9221641,0,[Extraction of cystic duct occlusion calculus in laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,"Occluding stones left in the stumpf of the cystic duct may account for between 17% and 25% of the cases of post-cholecystectomy syndrome. When acutely inflamed or empyemic gallbladders are removed, an occlusive cystic duct stone must almost always be expected. When performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, therefore, care must be taken to ensure that any stone occluding the cystic duct are detected and removed. After completely freeing the cystic duct to the point of its junction with the common bile duct, it is carefully ""palpated"" with a 5 mm forceps for the presence of stones. Any such present are pressed out of the duct through a transverse incision, and retrieved. Bile reflux through the incision in the duct indicates freedom from stones. Finally, intraoperative cholangiography can be performed."

Thirty-three patients had internal biliary fistulas and the incidence was 1.9%. Of 33 patients, 20 were women and 13 were men with the average age 63 years, and their mean duration of illness was 4 years. A total of 37 fistulas were found and the most common type was choledochoduodenal (62%), followed by cholecystoduodenal (19%), cholecystocholedochal (11%) and cholecystocolonic (8%) fistulas. Internal biliary fistulas of thirty-one patients were caused by biliary stones and those of two patients by malignant tumors. All of the 17 bile samples examined were bacteria positive and the majority of calculi were brown pigment stones. All of the choledochoduodenal fistulas were correctly diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. In 14 patients with cholecystoenteric or cholecystocholedochal fistulas, direct evidence of the internal fistula was obtained only in 7 patients (50%) preoperatively. Pneumobilia, a small atrophic gallbladder adherent to the neighboring organs and a history of spontaneous disappearance of jaundice in elderly patients may indicate the presence of a cholecystoentric fistula. Since the preoperative diagnostic rate for internal biliary fistula involving the gallbladder is still low, care is necessary before and at the time of surgery especially during laparoscopic cholecystectomy for elderly patients with cholelithiasis."

A 68-year-old woman noticed a tumor palpable in the left supraclavicular fossa. The patient had no pain around the neck and shoulder. A radio-opaque shadow 6 cm in diameter was detected in her left apical lung field on chest roentgenogram. Chest CT and MRI showed that the tumor was located in the superior mediastinum, extending up to the thoracic inlet, and there was no invasion of the surroundings. At first, a thoracoscopic examination was performed to assess the possibility of the excision. After dissecting the tumor from the mediastinal tissue and the first costovertebrae as far as possible by thoracoscopic surgery, a supraclavicular approach was used to enter the thoracic cavity. Complete resection of the tumor was successfully performed by thoracoscopic surgery combined with a supraclavicular approach. The tumor was removed in a plastic bag through the supraclavicular defect. Postoperative histopathology revealed that the tumor was a benign neurogenic one. A satisfactory follow-up of 5 postoperative days was observed without any complications, and the patient was discharged. The procedure was safe, easy, and minimally invasive to perform. Moreover, the supraclavicular approach could be used to add trocar port if needed."

Findings were compared with transabdominal ultrasonography, laparoscopy, surgery, and pathology. Laparoscopic ultrasonography was able to visualize the presence and origin of small bile duct tumors or stones and small liver metastases, which could not be seen or could be visualized only doubtfully by ultrasonography and laparoscopy. Laparoscopic ultrasonography was more useful in staging of small tumors of the gallbladder or proximal common bile duct than in staging bifurcation (Klatskin) tumors.

CD009323,0,9159258,0,Management of benign adnexal masses by vaginal route.,"Until recently, surgical treatment of a benign adnexal mass implied a laparotomy. In recent years, the development of laparoscopic surgery, as well as ultrasound-guided aspiration techniques, have significantly modified the treatment options for these patients. These procedures have shown considerable advantages. They have reduced surgical trauma and have shortened the hospital stay. We present the results of our experience on the feasibility of a trans-vaginal surgical approach for the removal of benign adnexal masses. This technique, using traditional and cheap surgical instruments, allows the surgeon to excise benign adnexal masses, by entering the peritoneum through the posterior vaginal fornix and thus avoids the trauma of laparotomy. Fifty-four patients were operated on by this technique at our Department. The mean age was 39 years (range 21-66). In all cases, the operation was completed by the trans-vaginal approach. The median operative time was 30 minutes (range 20-45), and no blood transfusion was needed. The pathological diagnoses were as follows: functional ovarian cyst; 19, endometriotic cyst; 18, dermoid cyst; 11, parovarian cyst; 4 and peduncolated fibroid of the uterine fundus; 2 cases. The diameter of the adnexal masses ranged from 3 to 10 cm (median of 6 cm). In 30 cases, a conservative surgery was done (including 2 myomectomies), whereas in 24 cases, the adnexectomy was needed. Median post-operative stay in hospital was 4 days (range 1-14). This study shows the feasibility of trans-vaginal surgical approach for benign adnexal masses. The advantages and limitations of this technique, as well as of the traditional and laparoscopic surgery are considered and discussed. We believe that the transvaginal approach could be useful and cost-effective for the treatment of selected cases of adnexal masses."

CD009323,0,9064567,0,[Laparoscopic surgery in patients over 75 years of age].,"Laparoscopic surgery in over-75-year-olds. Surgery in the elderly is becoming increasingly frequent and in some series accounts for around 40% of operations performed. Morbidity and mortality are still high in relation to the type of surgery and anesthesiological risk, with complications linked above all to respiratory and thromboembolic pathologies. The use of a laparoscopic technique in elective and emergency digestive tract surgery may reduce the problems linked to the onset of cardiorespiratory failures and parietal infections. This prospective study aims to evaluate the results of laparoscopic surgery in over-75-year-old patients hospitalised in the Department of Laparoscopic Surgery at Bellvitge Hospital compared to data reported in the literature. Out of 379 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery, 32 were over-75-year-olds (range 75-89). Ten patients had been diagnosed with gallstones, 9 with acute cholecystitis, 10 with biliary pancreatitis, 2 with iatal hernia and 1 with cancer of the sigma. A total of 29 cholecystectomies were performed, of which 10 in association with pancreatic drainage, 2 Nissen and one left hemicolectomy. Overall mortality was 6.2% following the death of 2 patients: 1 patient, who had been admitted for acute cholecystitis and had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy, presented an acute pulmonary edema three days after surgery with cardiac tamponade which represented the cause of death; another patient, admitted for acute biliary pancreatitis, presented a cerebral thromboembolism on the sixth day after surgery leading to death. Other complications included: parietal abscess, basal atelectasis, 2 residual choledochal calculosis and one case of external biliary fistula, with an overall mortality of 9.3%. The results reported in the literature do not report extensive series of over-75-year-olds undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Some authors report high percentages of laparotomic conversion, others a slightly higher morbidity rate with nil mortality. The present results are comparable to those of other authors with regard to the lower morbidity (3.1%) of laparoscopic compared to laparotomic (18.3%) surgery in elderly, high-risk patients. Even if the present series is relatively small (32 patients), the results obtained encourage the use of laparoscopic techniques in over-75-year-old patients so as to reduce mortality and morbidity compared to conventional surgery."

CD009323,0,8948036,0,Junction of the cystic duct with the left hepatic duct: report of a case discovered during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"We report a case of an anomalous junction of the cystic duct with the left hepatic duct found during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Only five other patients with this anatomy have been reported. Two of these five patients had left-sided gallbladders, and the remaining patients (including ours) had their gallbladder in its normal location. Although the prevalence of this anomaly associated with left-sided gallbladders is 5.6 to 14.3%, this anomaly appears to be quite rare in patients with gallbladders in the normal position. In four cases, it was accompanied by left-sided gallbladder or low bifurcation of the common hepatic duct. This rare condition may accompany other biliary anomalies and should be kept in mind when performing cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,9269102,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in children and adolescents.,"During the period between August 1991 and November 1995, seven patients under age 17 were submitted to videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Two were males and five females with ages ranging from 12 to 16 years (mean 13.8 years). The diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis with gallstones was made by the clinical history and physical and ultrasonographic examinations. There was no evidence of an association with hemolytic diseases, familial hyperlipidemia or Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia and the abdomen approached by four ports: a 10 mm umbilical incision, a 5 mm cystic, a 5 mm one at the xiphoid appendix and a 10 mm one at the left lateral margin of the left rectus abdominal muscle between the umbilical scar and the xiphoid appendix. Operative time averaged 120 minutes (105-150 min). One case required conversion to laparotomic approach because of Mirizzi's Syndrome, which was diagnosed by intraoperative cholangiography performed in all cases. There were no deaths or major postoperative complications. Hospital stays ranged from 1-3 days in the six patients submitted to LC. Thus LC in children can be considered a good method, requiring only more care regarding the use of proper equipment, complete and careful dissection of the biliary hilus, and intraoperative cholangiography. The latter is indispensable, as these children can present a higher rate of anatomic anomalies. The advantages of this techniques include a less painful postoperative period with a faster recovery, and it is especially recommended in children, who are less tolerant to physical restriction and pain than adults."
CD009323,0,9030469,0,Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a useful adjunct to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Preoperative ERCP is indicated if there is a high degree of suspicion for common duct stones, when severe gallstone-induced pancreatitis is present, or when there is uncertainty regarding the diagnosis. The best indicators of common duct stones preoperatively are an elevated bilirubin, a dilated common bile duct (CBD) on sonography, or stones visualized in the CBD on sonography. Mild gallstone pancreatitis and transient mild elevations in liver enzymes are not predictive of CBD stones and are not indications for ERCP. Postoperative ERCP is highly effective in clearing CBD stones. It has the advantage of being more readily available as compared to laparoscopic CBD exploration, and preserves all the advantages of the laparoscopic approach. Post-operative ERCP is indicated for retained CBD stones, evaluation and therapy of biliary injuries, and persistent biliary symptoms or abnormal liver enzymes and bilirubin. ERCP is the procedure of choice for the evaluation of laparoscopic biliary injuries. Major biliary injuries will generally require surgical therapy. Bile duct strictures are sometimes amenable to endoscopic therapy with dilation and stents. Biliary leaks are readily treatable with endoscopic therapy. Small cystic duct stump leaks and leaks from a duct of Lushka close within a few days with nasobiliary drainage. Larger leaks may require more prolonged drainage with stents and early supplemental percutaneous drainage of an accompanying biloma. Bilious ascites should be treated with nasobiliary drainage using low suction to be prevent contamination of the peritoneal cavity with intestinal flora, and simultaneous percutaneous ascites drainage. Biliary leaks, unless associated with major bile duct injuries, rarely require surgical therapy."

CD009323,0,8928278,0,[Two days' hospital stay after laparoscopic colon resection].,"In order to reduce surgical stress-induced dysfunction and morbidity in the postoperative period after colon cancer surgery in old people, we performed the operations laparoscopically and optimized the postoperative regime especially as regards to treatment of pain, early oral intake and mobilisation. The patients were treated with continuous epidural infusion of local anaesthetic for 48 hours postoperatively. Morphine was avoided. Normal oral intake was allowed immediately after operation and active mobilisation was ensured. Twenty patients with a median age of 81 years (71-92 years), who preoperatively were able to take care of themselves at home, entered the study. In four the operation was converted to open surgery due mainly to growth of the cancer into neighbouring organs. One patient had to have an open reoperation due to small bowel strangulation. Fifteen followed the scheduled programme. They all had normal bowel function on day one or two and were mobilised for eight hours on day two and 12 hours on day three. Accordingly postoperative hospital stay was only two days (median), and the high level of activity continued at home after discharge. The combination of laparoscopic mini-invasive surgical technique and a postoperative regime that optimized pain treatment, early oral intake and active mobilisation considerably reduced postoperative convalescence after colon cancer surgery in old patients."
CD009323,0,8944467,0,Hepatobiliary anatomy in patients with transposition of the gallbladder: implications for safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"The surgical anatomy of six patients with sinistroposition of the gallbladder is described. Five of these were encountered in a consecutive series of 1764 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstone disease in two hospitals between 1989 and 1994, a prevalence of 0.3 per cent in patients undergoing this operation. Despite the left-sided transposition of the gallbladder, the biliary pain experienced by these patients was always on the right side. Preoperative diagnosis of this anomaly was made in only one of six patients despite routine preoperative external ultrasonography and selective preoperative cholangiography. In sinistroposition the cystic artery always crosses in front of the common bile duct from right to left. The cystic duct may open on the left or right side of the common hepatic duct. The anomaly does not preclude safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy but modifications of the port sites and use of the falciform lift facilitate the procedure in these cases. The anatomical features of the sixth case encountered in a patient undergoing resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma indicate that sinistroposition of the gallbladder may be due to failure of development of segment IV of the liver."
CD009323,0,8914682,0,A case of traumatic neuroma of the gallbladder in the absence of previous surgery and cholelithiasis.,"We experienced a patient with traumatic neuroma of the gallbladder with no history of gallbladder surgery or cholelithiasis. A 74-year-old man was referred to our department after a gallbladder tumor was incidentally discovered during a preoperative screening examination for prostate hypertrophy. Ultrasonography, MRI, CT and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed a protuberant lesion of the gallbladder. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted but adhesion between the liver and duodenum forced us to convert to open laparotomy. Cholecystectomy and adjacent liver tissue resection was performed. Diagnosis was made by frozen histology during operation. It revealed no malignancy. Postoperative pathological examination revealed traumatic neuroma associated with inflammation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of gallbladder neuroma without a history of gallstones or surgery in the English and Japanese literature since 1980. This traumatic neuroma should be considered in a differential diagnosis in treating gallbladder neoplasm, even in the absence of an operative history or cholelithiasis."

CD009323,0,8890418,0,Endoscopic management of bile duct leaks after attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Fourteen patients with symptomatic bile duct leaks following laparoscopic cholecystectomy were treated using endotherapeutic techniques. Patients presented with abdominal pain, liver test abnormalities, jaundice, leukocytosis, and fever. Twelve leaks originated from cystic duct stumps and two from right posterior hepatic ducts. Distal biliary obstruction, which may have promoted leakage, was present in five patients. Treatment methods included stent insertion with endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES), stent insertion without ES, and nasobiliary tube (NBT) placement without ES. Eleven of 14 patients had prompt resolution of their bile leaks following initial endotherapy. Three patients with continued leakage underwent successful repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 4-5 days after the initial examination. Cholangiographic evidence of leak closure was documented in all patients, and all remained asymptomatic during an average follow-up period of 18.5 months. Endoscopic therapy is safe and effective treatment for clinically significant bile leaks following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In our small group of patients, NBT alone did not appear to be as effective as endoprostheses with or without ES. The ideal endoscopic treatment method has not yet been established but will likely vary depending on the site and specific nature of the injury and any concomitant biliary ductal pathology."

A Medline search was performed for all port site recurrences published in the literature. These reports were analysed and port site recurrences studied to determine initial stage of cancers, time to recurrence and whether the port site was an isolated site of recurrence or part of widespread intra-abdominal disease. The possible aetiologies were similarly reviewed and several recent basic science reports assessed. To date, 93 port site recurrences have been published. These have occurred with colorectal cancers as well as ovarian, gastric, pancreatic and other malignancies. Often, these recurrences are isolated and most standard means of prevention of cell dissemination may not prevent their occurrence. Possible mechanisms include aerosolisation of tumour cells, exfoliation, and changes in immune function. Port site recurrences continue to be reported. Their aetiology is unclear but the occurrence is of concern and requires continued scrutiny for laparoscopic oncologic surgery."
CD009323,0,8923997,0,Laparoscopic-assisted large bowel resection.,"Laparoscopic colon resection is a viable alternative to open colectomy. For non-malignant lesions, laparoscopic resection of the affected large bowel is attractive. For malignant lesions, where resection for cure is highly dependent on lymph node clearance, laparoscopic resection has met with criticisms regarding the adequacy of nodal clearance that can be achieved laparoscopically. Several published studies have shown that the operation though technically demanding, does not compromise the extent of resection. We report a series of 43 cases of laparoscopic colon resection done sequentially and successfully from January 1992 to June 1995. The operative time averaged 180 minutes (range 120 to 300 minutes). Five patients developed postoperative complications, which were mainly pulmonary and wound infections. There were no anastomotic leaks or perioperative deaths. The mean hospital stay was 5.3 days (range 4 to 9 days). By the third postoperative day, all patients were feeding and ambulatory. Long-term complications included one small bowel obstruction and one port site recurrence. In our selected group of patients, laparoscopic colon resection has not shown any adverse outcome.

Six patients required re-hospitalisation including 2 patients with pancreatitis, 1 patient with Ascaris cholangitis, 1 patient with residual stone of the common bile duct (CBD) after laparoscopic CBD exploration, 1 patient with a stone in the CBD after LC, and 1 patient with bile leakage from the cystic duct stump and peritonitis. Of the 2428 patients treated, there was only 1 operative mortality. This patient developed frequent episodes of supraventricular tachycardia. She was found to have pnuemonia on the 21st postoperative day and she died. Apart from this, 1 other patient was found to have primary cancer of the liver 1 month after LC.

Theoretically, when the tumor is small and confined to the pancreas, adequate locoregional control is possible by radical resection of the tumor, lymph nodes, peripancreatic neurons, and surrounding soft tissue. Realistically, at the time of initial diagnosis, 50% of patients have distant metastases to the liver or peritoneal surface, and more than 80% of the remaining patients have locally advanced tumors. Fewer than 10% of all patients with a small pancreatic adenocarcinoma confined to the pancreas are candidates for cure by use of radical resection as the sole treatment modality. Given these sobering statistics on the late presentation of this tumor, it is not surprising that, even after radical resection, the overall median survival time is only 18 to 20 months and the overall 5-year survival is approximately 10%. These dismal results led to a call in the early 1970s for abandonment of radical therapy in this disease and for treatment of all patients with palliative care only. These statistics are discouraging, but over the last 10 years a therapeutic renaissance has erupted. This resurgence has been driven by surgeons performing pancreaticoduodenectomy with low perioperative mortality rates and excellent functional results. It has been fueled by the use of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy protocols. Improved radiographic imaging techniques such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, helical computed tomography scan, and endoscopic ultrasonography are beginning to show promise in facilitating an earlier diagnosis and in providing highly accurate tumor staging without operation. It is hoped that recent observations on the molecular genetics of pancreatic adenocarcinoma will lead to a better understanding of tumor biology, which in turn should result in a more rational application of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Effective percutaneous, endoscopic, and laparoscopic techniques have been developed concomitant with the recent advances in radiographic and endoscopic imaging. These minimally invasive options can now provide meaningful, long-lasting palliation and improved quality of life for the large number of patients with unresectable or metastatic disease who have no other treatment options. The therapeutic nihilism so pervasive in previous decades has no place in the contemporary treatment of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. True long-term survival seems possible for a growing proportion of patients, and minimally invasive, effective palliation is achievable in the vast majority of patients. It is only through aggressive recruitment of patients for treatment, application of novel diagnostic and therapeutic protocols, and further laboratory investigation into the biology of pancreatic cancer that the momentum of the last decade toward improved outcome and quality of life can be sustained."
CD009323,0,8884801,0,Surgical management of pancreatic cancer.,"The treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer requires the expertise of medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, radiologists, and surgical oncologists. The surgeon's role in the management of patients with pancreatic cancer extends beyond the performance of surgical resection and bypass procedures to include diagnosis, staging (including determination of resectability), and therapy (both curative and palliative). If a lesion is deemed resectable, the surgeon's goal is to achieve clear pathologic margins in order to optimize the patient's chances for cure. The surgeon also plays a key role in the palliation of disease in patients with unresectable lesions. Biliary and duodenal bypass, endoscopic stenting, laparoscopy, and celiac ganglion injection may be needed to maximize a patient's remaining quality of life. In addition, the surgical oncologist should be involved in clinical trials testing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemoradiotherapies that may lead to the development of more effective therapies for pancreatic cancer."
CD009323,0,9074105,0,Laparoscopic Treatment of Ovarian Retention Pathology.,"We define ovarian retention pathology as the complications (cystic, degenerative, adhesions, endometriosis, pain, etc.) attributed to ovaries deliberately retained at the time of hysterectomy. We established a protocol for laparoscopy in these women. During 14 laparoscopic procedures for ovarian retention pathology, only one intraoperative complication occurred, a small bowel injury requiring minilaparotomy. One woman required repeat surgery for ovarian remnant syndrome. Published experience with laparotomy suggests that significant injuries to or resections of bowel, bladder, or ureters can occur, but the limited experience with laparoscopic surgery has not shown significant complications."
CD009323,0,8840457,0,Injury to a duplicated cystic duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Duplication of the cystic duct is a rare variation of the biliary system. It is important to pay attention to this variation to avoid intraoperative biliary system injury, especially during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In a 66-year-old woman with gallstones, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed no anomaly of the biliary system. At laparoscopic cholecystectomy, although intraoperative cholangiography demonstrated the second cystic duct, we misdiagnosed the duplication of cystic duct because preoperative ERCP had demonstrated normal anatomy. It was thought that the second cystic duct was dissected during the operation and the patient suffered from postoperative bile leakage. After reoperation, the patient recovered well. The diagnostic and therapeutic problems of such an anomaly are discussed below with the review of the literature."

CD009323,0,8681296,0,Pancreatic carcinoma in perspective. A continuing challenge.,"There are approximately 27,000 new cases of carcinoma of the pancreas each year and most afflicted patients will die of the disease. Although smoking is a common denominator, chronic pancreatitis is considered an important precursor lesion in a smaller number of cancers. Pancreatic cancer is primarily a disease of the pancreatic ducts. The molecular events are under intense study, but c-K-ras mutation is involved in approximately 80% of the cases and p53 to a slightly lesser degree (60-80%). Early manifestations are usually occult, but jaundice is a common manifestation in patients with cancers of the pancreatic head. Thin-slice computed tomography, portography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are currently the most sensitive detection techniques. The developing use of endoscopic ultrasound and laparoscopy appear to enhance detection and are under evaluation. In many patients with advanced disease, endoscopic bypass may eliminate the need for unnecessary surgery, although gastrointestinal bypass is still required in some patients (10-15%). Curative resection is possible in selected patients (perhaps 10-15%), with expectation of extended survival ranging from 6->20% in some series. The survival differences may be related to stage, patient selection, and the expertise of the operative team. Preoperative chemotherapy/radiation is under study and may improve outcome. Clinical trial participation is essential for improvement in treatment outcomes."
CD009323,0,9005776,0,[Intrahepatic dilation of the bile ducts. Particularity of a clinical case].,"We report the case of a 71 years old male patient with a ""simple"" form of Caroli's syndrome. The ""simple"" form is less common than the form associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis. In this case the intrahepatic bile duct dilatation was confined to the segments V and VI, and intrahepatic lithiasis and cholelithiasis were associated. Usually, Caroli's syndrome remains asymptomatic for the first 20 years of the patient's life, sometimes longer, and in few cases for the patient's whole life. ""Simple"" asymptomatic Caroli's syndrome is generally unrecognized and in our own case it was an intraoperative finding. Patient's age, the presence of a hepatitis C and the absence of malignant changes discouraged us from performing a right hepatectomy and then a Roux-en-Y intrahepatic bile duct jejunal anastomosis was done. One year after the operation the patient is leading a normal life, and he is symptom-free."

CD009323,0,8781934,0,The role of laparoscopy in the diagnosis of cirrhosis.,"A definitive diagnosis of cirrhosis is important in the prognosis and management of patients with chronic liver disease. The diagnosis of cirrhosis is made either by histologic examination of a biopsy specimen or upon visualization of a diffusely nodular and firm surface of the liver at laparotomy or laparoscopy. A liver biopsy, however, may not demonstrate the histologic features of cirrhosis in some cirrhotic patients. Our goal in this study was to compare the accuracy of liver descriptions made during laparoscopy with liver histology found by laparoscopic biopsy in patients with chronic liver disease."

CD009323,0,8669018,0,Flexible endoscopy as an adjunct to laparoscopic surgery.,"The combination of flexible endoscopy and laparoscopy has allowed a creative approach to management of both benign and malignant gastrointestinal diseases. Historically, attempts to incorporate intraluminal endoscopy with laparoscopy were made early in the historical development of laparoscopy, especially as an aid to stage gastric cancer. The most common modern application is that of flexible choledochoscopy by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Other innovative uses include localization of tumors, control of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric tumor excision and biliary decompression, and bowel resection. With imagination guided by sound surgical principles, the combined use of laparoscopy and intraluminal endoscopy should expand the boundaries of general surgery."

CD009323,0,8661627,0,Laparoscopic treatment of gallbladder and common bile duct stones: a prospective study.,"The aim of this study was to investigate prospectively the feasibility, success rate, safety, and short-term results of single-stage laparoscopic treatment of gallstones and ductal stones in 100 consecutive, unselected patients. Common bile duct (CBD) stones were diagnoses at routine intraoperative cholangiography and choledochoscopy in 100 of 950 patients with gallstones undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Unsuspected CBD stones were present in 39 patients (4.1% of 950; 39% of 100); 26 patients were referred for surgery after failed endoscopic sphinctertomy (ES) performed elsewhere. Transcystic duct CBD exploration (TC-CBDE) was the procedure of choice. When it was not feasible, choledochotomy and direct CBD exploration (D-CBDE) was performed. Use of biliary drainage was liberal. A completion cholangiogram was obtained for all patients. Laparoscopic treatment of CBD stones was successful in 96 patients: after TC-CBDE in 63 and after D-CBDE in 33. Four operations were converted to open surgery (4%). Retained stones, observed in five patients, were treated by ES in two cases and by percutaneous endoscopic/fluoroscopic lithotripsy in three. Minor morbidity included biloma (n = 2), port site infection (n = 2), and subumbilical hematoma (n = 1). Major morbidity was bile leakage from the cystic duct stump in two cases due to clips or transcystic duct drainage displacement, respectively. One elderly, high risk patient died after being referred for several failed attempts of endoscopic clearance; she died from cardiogenic shock 3 days after successful laparoscopic treatment. Laparoscopic CBD exploration is feasible and safe in most patients, with short-term results that compare favorably with the results of sequential ES/LC reported in the literature."
CD009323,0,8658220,0,Surgical treatment for gastric cancer: the Japanese approach.,"Present status of gastric cancer surgery in Japan and several new procedures are reviewed in this article. Japanese treatment results of this disease were significantly better than Western results even when stages were adjusted. Generally speaking, Japanese surgical procedures are more aggressive and meticulous compared with the Western approach, and these attitudes have produced the difference in survival. Particularly, systematic lymph node (LN) dissection is included as a standard procedure, and the adjacent organs are frequently resected when tumor invades them. The latest topics in surgery are the transdiaphragmatic approach for procedures in the mediastinum, para-aortic LN dissection, computer-assisted rational lymphadenectomy, LN imaging for complete dissection, removal of the peritoneum, and hyperthermo-chemotherapy for peritoneal carcinomatosis. Consideration of postoperative quality of life (QOL) is a new trend, and many interesting procedures have been proposed to maintain QOL, such as endoscopic mucosal resection and laparoscopic wedge resection for early cancer, pylorus-preserving gastric resection to reduce dumping syndrome, pancreas-preserving total gastrectomy to reduce fistula and postoperative diabetes."
CD009323,0,8640625,0,Hemobilia complicating elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a case report.,"Iatrogenic injury to the hepatic or cystic arteries can occur during laparoscopic cholecystectomy and can be seen in isolation or in association with bile-duct injury. The most common manifestation of arterial injury is intraoperative hemorrhage; also, interruption of the right hepatic artery can occur without hemorrhage, and this can be clinically insignificant or associated with hepatic ischemia. A less common manifestation of arterial injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is presented. A 48-year-old woman had a pseudoaneurysm of the major anterior branch of the right hepatic artery in association with an injury to the common hepatic duct. This complication presented as massive hemobilia after she had been discharged from the hospital. Definitive repair of the pseudoaneurysm was carried out at the time of Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy for correction of the associated duct injury. This unusual vascular complication should be considered in patients after laparoscopic cholecystectomy who demonstrate evidence of late occult or obvious hemorrhage."

Analysis of the results of 26,440 operations in Hungary].","The authors analyse the etiology, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of 148 biliary tract injuries in connection with 26,440 laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed in 89 domestic institutes between January 1st, 1991, and December 31st, 1994. There was no significant correlation between the amount of laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed in one institute and the incidence of biliary tract injuries and postoperative bile leakage (wide range of figures were found in different institutes), but in the second year of practice, the incidence of both complication decreased (there was statistically significant difference between the regression co-efficients). There was no significant correlation between the laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed and the rate of conversion, but the co-efficient of the regression curve showing the correlation of the absolute number of laparoscopic cholecystectomies and conversions significantly decreased in the second year of practice. In institutes having significantly more conversions, more cases of bile leakage was found also. There is a significantly positive relationship between biliary tract injuries and postoperative bile leakage; the more lesions are found in an institute, the more cases of bile leakage they have. There was no significant relationship between the incidence biliary tract injuries and postoperative bile leakage and the usage of intraoperative cholangiography, preoperative intravenous cholangiography and/or ERCP. The partial and complete injuries of main bile ducts were detected intraoperatively significantly more often while most of the lesions of the area of cystic duct were detected postoperatively. There was no significant difference between the types of the only postoperative recognized injuries and the time of establishing the diagnosis. Simple suture was performed in 69.2% of the partial injuries (with or without T-tube or other drainage), while 63.3% of the complete transsections were treated with biliodigestive anastomosis. In univariant analysis the type of injury, the primary treatment modality did not affect on the outcome (the ratio of cured and expired), but significantly more patients continue to have complaints following biliodigestive anastomosis than following the treatment of lesions around the cystic duct. The older the patient is, the worse the prognosis is. The primary treatment modality (biliodigestive anastomosis or biliary tract reconstruction with or without drain) did not significantly altered the necessity of reoperation. Thermic injury caused significantly more partial than complete lesion. Disturbance in identification of the anatomic structures leads significantly more partial or complete main bile duct injuries than lesion in region of the cystic duct and causes more complete transsections than partial lesions. According to multivariant analysis the outcome is significantly influenced in an adverse way by the necessity of repeated interventions and higher age."

Laparoscopy is showing good results in bowel surgery so as previously got on biliary tract: less visceral manipulation, less stimulation of immunologic system, less pain, early resumption of peristalsis and food intake, better recovery, less hospital stay. We experimented on pig ultra-low laparoscopic resection of the rectum, with preservation of sfincterial function, and mechanical anastomosis at the upper edge of the sfincterial ring.

The pancreatic diseases considered by these methods were as follows: 9 cases of Pancreatitis, 11 cases of Pancreatic cysts, 5 cases of endocrine cancer, 109 cases of Exocrine cancer and 2 not conclusive cases. Diagnostic accuracy of FNB and laparoscopy was evaluated for each group and, in particular, for cancer patients. In the latter group, FNB helped to detect abdominal diffusion in 25 cases (33%) while laparoscopy, including laparoscopic washing, revealed a micro-diffusion in 31 cases (55%), the latter not shown previously by CT, RNM and US. The combination of these methods allows us to confirm the advanced stage of the majority of pancreatic cancers at onset.

Eleven subsequent patients with the symptomatic cholelithiasis confirmed with ultrasonography have been operated with this technique. Laser served mainly to dissect gall bladder from the liver. Biliary duct and cystic artery have been clipped. No complications of the laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy have been noted. Gall bladder wall has been perforated in 3 patients operated with contact technique. However, there have been no technical problems, and further preparation of the gall bladder has been successfully completed with laser in all cases. A value of laser in laparoscopic cholecystectomy seems lower than that of electrocautery. However, a non-contact photocoagulation in the hemostasis of blood vessels in gall bladder removal site seems promising. Laser prolongs the duration of surgery and markedly increases its cost. Further investigations are required to evaluate laparoscopic laser cholecystectomies as the effects of laser beam in the abdominal cavity remains unknown."

CD009323,0,8600845,0,Accessory bile duct and laparoscopic cholangiography: report of three cases.,"Laparoscopic cholangiography can be useful in identifying an accessory bile duct. Failure to identify an accessory bile duct during laparoscopic cholangiography may lead to complications and prolonged hospitalizations. At times, the accessory duct can be clearly seen filling with contrast; at other times, the only clue to the possible presence of an accessory duct is opacification of the gallbladder. If the cystic duct has been clipped on the gallbladder side of the cholangiocatheter, the only way for the gallbladder to fill is through an accessory duct. If the actual accessory duct cannot be demonstrated and ligated, then drains should be placed in the gallbladder bed. The three cases presented here illustrate these points."
CD009323,0,8600842,0,Management of choledocholithiasis encountered during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"To evaluate the prevailing methods of management and assess the safety of laparoscopic treatment of choledocholithiasis, a retrospective review of all common bile duct explorations (CBDE) initiated during laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the Medical College of Georgia was performed. From December 1990 until December 1994, 604 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed. In 28 of these patients (26 female, 2 male) with an age range of 17 to 60 years, CBDE was initiated; 21 were performed laparoscopically, and 7 were converted to open CBDE. The procedure was successful in completely clearing the duct of stones in 24 of 28 cases (17 laparoscopic, 7 open). Postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was successfully employed in three of the cases of retained stones, and in the fourth, the stone was felt to be small enough to pass without further intervention. Biliary balloon catheters were successfully used to clear the duct in 8 of 17 laparoscopic CBDEs, and a laparoscopic choledochoscope introduced through the cystic duct was used in 7 cases; both were used in 2 cases. The open CBDEs were performed in standard fashion utilizing balloon catheters and choledochoscopy. The only operative complications were the four above-mentioned cases of retained stones. In summary, choledocholithiasis encountered during the course of laparoscopic cholecystectomy can frequently be managed with a laparoscopic CBDE."

The site of the leakage was the cystic duct in five cases, the common bile duct in one case, the hepatic ""bed"" in one case and it was undetectable in one case. Five patients had common bile duct stone and one patients also had common bile duct stricture. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed in all cases with stone extraction if needed, and stent insertion (7 or 10 Fr straight endoprosthesis) in six cases. The stents were removed after 4-16 weeks in all cases, except the patients with common bile duct stricture, in whom the stent was exchanged for two other endoprostheses to prevent restricture after three months, she is still under treatment.

CD009323,0,10401098,0,Laparoscopic Pancreatic Resections.,"Resection of the pancreas by the laparoscopic approach is still in its infancy and the reported experience is very limited. Despite its retroperitoneal location, exposure and mobilisation of the pancreas can be achieved in the vast majority of patients and does not usually pose major technical problems provided the surgeon is experienced in advanced laparoscopic techniques and in pancreatic surgery. Based on our experience, laparoscopic enucleation of islet-cell tumours constitutes an ideal indication. Both the precise location (by contact ultrasonography of the pancreas) and the enucleation (by ultrasonic dissection) are facilitated by the laparoscopic approach. Laparoscopic distal 70-80% pancreatectomy for chronic pancreatitis and cystic tumors appears to confer benefit over the equivalent open operation by accelerating recovery and return to full activity of the patient after surgery. By contrast, our experience with laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary cancer has been disappointing and we have not documented any benefit from this approach. In addition, there are real concerns that an oncologically adequate operation (with extended lymphadenectomy) for cancer of the head of the pancreas is not possible by the laparoscopic approach."
CD009323,0,10401096,0,Laparoscopic Exposure of the Pancreas and Staging of Pancreatic Cancer.,"Laparoscopy combined with laparoscopic contact ultrasonography was recently proposed as a new and effective method for staging and assessment of resectability in pancreatic cancer. In order to limit the occurrence of false-negative findings, the laparoscopic technique should be as close as possible to the equivalent laparotomic procedure. That includes opening of the lesser sac, which is best achieved through an infragastric route, with resulting wide exposure of the pancreatic body and tail. Laparoscopic contact ultrasonography is then performed for the purpose to define tumor limits, study relationships with major vessels, and assess limphnodal invasion. The results of this procedure in a series of 25 patients are discussed in this report. It is concluded that laparoscopic staging of pancreatic cancer is safe and effective in achieving the goal of avoiding unnecessary laparotomies and selecting candidates for surgical resection."
CD009323,0,8929044,0,[Abdominal wall metastasis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma following laparoscopy].,"Wound recurrence after oncologic surgery is known since 1885, but nowadays we deal with a new problem after the rapid diffusion of laparoscopically assisted surgery and the 22 cases of trocar site metastases already reported in literature. Aim of this paper is to present a case of cutaneous seeding of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, in two trocar sites, after laparoscopy for lithiasis of the gallbladder. Diagnosis of neoplasia was made intraoperatively for the presence of peritoneal and omental carcinomatosis; no cholecystectomy was performed and after biopsy and postoperative TC-scan a chemotherapeutic treatment was started. Five months after the operation parietal seeding was evident and treated with local radiotherapy; the patient died one month later for further dissemination of the disease. The etiopathogenesis of tumor recurrence in the abdominal scar tissue is still unknown, local (trauma) and general (decreased immunologic defences) factors could be responsible. The apparent higher incidence after laparoscopic surgery could presuppose the presence of further specific risks: more tissue manipulation (increased cellular exfoliation), contact between trocar and abdominal wall for the whole operative period (malignant cell carrier), pneumoperitoneum. In conclusion, as 50% of the patients with cutaneous metastases die within 6 months after the operation and almost nobody is still alive after 4 years, it is necessary to establish if a real additional risk, due to the laparoscopic procedure, exists to contrast eventual benefits of the mini-invasive procedure."
CD009323,0,8919501,0,Comparison of laparoscopic and transabdominal ultrasonography in staging of cancer of the pancreatic head region.,"The value of laparoscopic ultrasonography in the staging of cancer of the pancreatic head region was compared prospectively to that of transabdominal ultrasonography. Eighty patients underwent LUS, after ultrasonography had shown normal Doppler findings of portal vessels and no signs of metastatic disease. Presence of hepatic or lymph node metastases and vascular tumor infiltration were evaluated in 74 and 48 patients, respectively. Laparoscopic ultrasonography showed liver metastases in 10 patients (14%). Specificity and positive predictive value for the laparoscopic technique determining vascular ingrowth were 97% and 92%, respectively, versus 89% and 77% by sonography in patients with normal Doppler findings (difference not statistically significant). Laparoscopic ultrasonography has shown improved detection of hepatic metastases compared to sonography, but it still must prove its value, as compared to noninvasive methods, in local staging."
CD009323,0,8774657,0,What is the role of reassessment laparoscopy in the management of gynecologic cancers in 1995?,"One hundred fifty-four patients with a diagnosis of ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma underwent 181 reassessment procedures to detect persistent or recurrent disease between January 1, 1989 and December 31, 1994 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. One hundred four laparoscopic procedures were performed. Eleven of these procedures were converted to laparotomy due to severe adhesions. Therefore, a total of 88 reassessment laparotomies were performed during the study period. Fifty-seven of 93 laparoscopies and 69 of 88 laparotomies were done as second-look procedures. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to patient age, tumor histology, degree of primary cytoreduction, and tumor stage or grade. Significant differences were found between laparoscopy and laparotomy groups in the following outcome variables evaluated: estimated blood loss (33.9 ml vs 164.9 ml, P = 0.0001), operative time (81.3 min vs 130.4 min, P = 0.0001), days of hospitalization (0.3 days vs 6.8 days, P = 0.0001), and direct cost/case ($2765 vs $5420, P = 0.0001). Despite obtaining 50% fewer biopsies with laparoscopy than laparotomy, the ability to detect disease was similar between these two groups: 47.3% vs 55.7% for all procedures and 52.6% vs 53.6% in the patients undergoing second-look procedures. Major complications in the laparoscopy group included transverse colon perforation (1), small bowel perforation (2), enterocutaneous fistula (1), and a retroperitoneal hematoma (1). Major complications in the laparotomy group included cystotomy (1), left ureteral injury (1), enterotomy (2), and SBO (4). Laparoscopy, when technically feasible, appears equally as effective as laparotomy in detecting persistent or recurrent malignant disease with less blood loss, less days spent in the hospital, less financial burden, and no increase in patient morbidity."

The cystic duct was used for entry to the CBD in 46 patients and in 14 a choledochotomy was performed. Of 51 patients with confirmed common duct stones, 38 had complete laparoscopic clearance (75 per cent). In 13 patients the duct was not cleared or was only partially cleared, of whom four went on to have clearance by postoperative percutaneous choledochoscopy down a cystic duct or T-tube track. Two patients with cystic duct tubes passed their remaining stones spontaneously. One patient had open exploration and six required endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Of nine patients without stones, choledochoscopy was impossible in three patients whose cholangiogram was later considered to be normal. In five patients stones were excluded by choledochoscopy and in one patient laparoscopic choledochoscopy was undertaken to better define abnormal biliary anatomy; this helped to avoid major bile duct injury. Choledochoscopy was easier with the smaller 3.6-mm ureteroscope but stone removal was more difficult when the basket was too small for the stones, the cystic duct too small relative to stone size or the number of stones was too great. Successful stone clearance was proportional to the level of effort expended, and was limited by operating time and equipment."

Its advantages over laparotomy are well described. However, its risks and long-term results have not been fully evaluated. We experienced three patients in whom intra-abdominal carcinomas failed to be recognized during laparoscopic surgery. The clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and radiologic findings were carefully reviewed in each case. Limited exploration of the abdominal cavity is one of the technical pitfalls in laparoscopic cholecystectomy; so surgeons can miss the carcinoma of extrabiliary system. To prevent such problems, a careful taking of the history and physical examination should be repeated by the responsible surgeon, who must be aware of the differential diagnosis of cholelithiasis, especially in elderly patients. If needed, additional radiologic studies are recommended."

Cystic duct cholangiography, particularly in the hands of the trainee, can be time consuming, and bile duct injury may be caused by attempts to cannulate the cystic duct. This study analyses 113 consecutive patients undergoing peroperative cholangiography through the gallbladder, or cholecystocholangiography. It was successful in 92 (81.4%) patients, the procedure adding less than 10 min to the operating time. There were no cholangiogram-related complications. Common anatomical variations included both short and particularly wide cystic ducts. This information helps to minimize the risk of damage to the common bile duct. This study demonstrates that cholecystocholangiography is a safe, simple, and effective alternative to cystic duct cholangiography with virtually no ""learning curve."" It provides a ""road-map"" of biliary anatomy and identifies common bile duct stones prior to the commencement of dissection. Unsuccessful cholecystocholangiography does not preclude the use of cystic duct cholangiography later in the operation. Difficult anatomy is demonstrated prior to dissection. When unsuspected bile duct calculi necessitate open exploration, further laparoscopic dissection is avoided."

The mean age of the group was 49.4 (30-80) years, mean weight 72.1 (44.5-114) kg, and mean parity 2.7 (0-8). All patients had preoperative urodynamic study to confirm genuine stress incontinence (GSI). Sixteen patients (14%) had dual pathology (GSI and detrusor instability). A transperitoneal approach was used in 93 operations and extraperitoneal in 20. The mean operating time was 108 (30-320) minutes and mean hospitalization 3.3 (1-10) days. In 13 women the operation was converted to laparotomy; 10 due to adhesions and diminished bladder mobility, 1 for inferior epigastric vessel injury, 1 for an ovarian tumour discovered incidentally at the procedure and 1 for equipment problems. Operative complications included 10 cystotomies (5 repaired laparoscopically), 2 extraperitoneal cases converted to transperitoneal, 1 inferior epigastric vessel injury, 1 vaginal tear, 1 suture through the bladder and 1 case of possible enterotomy oversewn at laparoscopy. The mean follow-up period was 8.4 (1-28) months. All patients were reviewed postoperatively and then contact was attempted either by telephone or in consultation. There was an overall 87% subjective success rate.

CD009323,0,8689155,0,Value of routine intraoperative cholangiography in detecting aberrant bile ducts and bile duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"A prospective study was performed to determine the frequency and type of bile duct abnormalities, and to determine whether routine use of intraoperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy might aid in the prevention of bile duct injuries. Overall, anatomical aberrations of the bile ducts were found in 98 (19 per cent) of 513 cholangiograms. The most common anomalies were at the hepatic confluence and constituted different types of right hepatic subsegmental ducts draining separately into the biliary tree (n = 43, 8.4 per cent), either close to the cystic duct or directly into the cystic duct. Three bile duct injuries (0.5 per cent) occurred during the study period. These results show that routine intraoperative cholangiography is feasible and provides valuable information about the anatomy of the biliary tract, thereby improving the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. If an injury to the biliary tract occurs early during operation, the cholangiogram allows the surgeon to detect the injury, to make a prompt repair and thereby reduce the morbidity associated with a delayed diagnosis. Routine use of intraoperative cholangiography is strongly recommended."

Of twenty-five patients presenting with postoperative bile leak, 11 had complete tie-off of common bile duct and required surgery, while the remaining 14 had injury without complete obstruction and could be managed by endoscopic methods. Of these 14 cases, bile leak occurred from the cystic duct in 11 patients and from the common hepatic duct, right hepatic duct and left hepatic duct in one patient each. Endoscopic procedures performed included sphincterotomy alone (four patients), sphincterotomy and stent placement (seven patients) and sphincterotomy followed by nasobiliary catheter drainage (three patients). There was no technical failure and bile leak was stopped in all patients. One patient died of haemobilia 5 days after stent placement. When technically feasible, postoperative bile leak can be managed safely and effectively by endoscopic methods, obviating the need for surgical reexploration."

CD009323,0,9183872,1,[Contribution of laparoscopic echography in the staging of curative resection of cancer of the pancreatic head (26 cases)].,"In a prospective study, 26 patients with pancreatic and peri-ampullary cancer were evaluated with ultrasound (US), computerized tomography (CT Scan), endoscopic ultra sonography (EUS) and laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS). Sensitivity of US and CT scan were comparable, although CT scan seems better to evaluate the size of the tumor and for lymph node detection. 50 per cent of patients had a criterion for noncurative resection. EUS (16 cases) had the best sensitivity (100 per cent) for the staging of small tumors (less than 20 millimeters), detection of adjacent nodes and the relation between tumor and mesenteric and portal veins. EUS was not able to detect peritoneal and/or liver micro-metastases (44 per cent of them would be missed by this examination alone). The criterion for noncurative resection was 56.6 per cent. LUS exactly assessed all tumors larger than 3 centimeters (100 per cent). The accuracy compared with endoscopic ultra-sonography was not as good for small tumors and adjacent nodes, was equal for the venous relations with tumors, but better concerning micro-peritoneal or hepatic metastasis. The criterion for noncurative resection was 80 per cent. These results suggest to use of US and CT as first-line procedures in the pre-operative staging and assessment of resectability of pancreatic cancers. When the patient does not appear to have disseminated lesions (50 per cent), endoscopic ultra-sonography gives a good estimation of the size of the tumor, node assessment and vascular relations. LES could be the first step for a curative surgical treatment LES revealed to discover 15 to 30 per cent of unknown micrometastases and avoided useless laparotomy in these patients."

Cholecystectomy has been considered as the gold standard in the treatment of symptomatic or complicated cholelithiasis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the new gold standard. Our Department of Surgery has adopted a policy of advising laparoscopic cholecystectomy in all patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis, but also subpopulation of high risk asymptomatic patients. This subgroup is made up by patients with long life expectancy, radioopaque stones, small calculus with patent cystic duct, nonfunctioning or calcified gall bladder, and patients with concomitant diabetes, cirrhosis, chronic hemolytic anemia, those that are candidates for kidney or heart transplantation, and those with underling degenerative diseases that are more likely to develop severe complication of cholelithiasis.

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the time period taken from when patients first present to their General Practitioners to surgery. Patients undergoing elective intraabdominal surgery over a 3 month period in a district general hospital were divided into two groups: One for those with underlying gastrointestinal malignancy requiring resection (n = 27), and the other in those with chronic biliary disease requiring laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 24). Patients with malignant disease presented to the GP at a mean of 3.0 months (SD 2.4) after symptom onset, and those with biliary disease at 3.5 months (SD 2.6). Those with malignancy were then referred and seen by the hospital within a mean of 2.8 weeks (SD 1.3), investigated in 3.3 weeks (SD 2.3) and operated on within 2.7 weeks (SD 1.2). The group with biliary disease were seen in hospital at 6.2 weeks (SD 1.9), investigated in 7.5 weeks (5.8) and operated on at 7.6 weeks (SD 2.1). Overall, the length of time it took from symptom onset to surgery in those with malignant disease was 26 weeks (SD 19), and in those with biliary disease 65 weeks (SD 35). This time period will inevitably lead many patients to become malnourished prior to admission, and this may have implications on the incidence of complications and length of in-patient stay."

Groups having experience in this kind of surgery stressed the contraindication to manage hydatid cysts of the liver laparoscopically. This reflects the primary concern regarding the possibility of cyst content spillage. This presentation aims to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic treatment of special types of hepatic hydatid cysts. A 26-year-old female Yemeni patient presented with atypical gall bladder dyspepsia. Abdominal ultrasound only showed chronic calcular cholecystitis. The patient was scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy on the 18th of August 1992. On exploration a globular cyst about 12 cm hanging with a stalk from the under surface of the right lobe of the liver was noticed. The gall bladder was used to elevate the liver. Dissection of the mass from the surrounding structures was achieved. Puncture and suction of the germinal and laminated layers were done. The connecting stalk was doubly ligated with endoloops and cut in between. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged 48 hours later. Hydatid cysts of the liver are dangerous to handle by laparoscopy. However whenever a case is met with where excision can be done, this could be achieved laparoscopically especially in pedunculated cysts. A device of 2 coaxial suckers is presented to procure laparoscopic management of hydatid cysts enough safety against ""spillage of contents"" as in open surgery."

Diagnostic laparoscopy is a very useful tool which provides information in conjunction with other instruments such as ultrasonography and computed tomography in the study of pancreatic cancer.

Although experimental cases of pancreatic resection have been described, the majority of patients require palliative treatment. Surgical bypass has a high morbidity rate and nonoperative biliary decompression has become an established treatment for relieving jaundice. However, these techniques are associated with a high rate of recurrent obstruction. Laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy gives the advantage of definitive bypass with shorter hospital stay, and a gastrojejunostomy can also be performed when duodenal obstruction occurs.

On these grounds a plastic operation of the bile duct on the endoprosthesis was made seven times, a high hilar anastomosis with a blind loop of the jejunum, as described by Roux, six times, once ligature of the cystic duct by an open approach and once ablation of the clamp from the bile duct. When an endoprosthesis is used, the authors recommended the long-term administration of deoxycholic acid derivatives. The reduced number of these injuries in 1995 at the clinic may, in the authors, opinion, be due to the fact that surgeons have acquired reasonable skill as regards the technique of thus operation."

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), as initially described, is done with cephalad traction on the gallbladder. We hypothesized LC exposure technique narrows the angle between the cystic and hepatic ducts, placing them at increased risk of injury."
CD009323,0,8701270,0,[Endoscopic therapy of bile leakage following laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,"Biliary leakages are more frequent in laparoscopic than in open cholecystectomy. The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic value of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) in the management of bile leakages after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The primary management was endoscopic sphincterotomy and extraction of remaining gallstones in the common bile duct to provide a decrease of biliary pressure, allowing closure of the fistulas. We report on 20 patients with bile leakage at ERCP, presenting between January 1991 and October 1995 with persistent bile discharge out of drainages, increasing fluid collections subhepatic (termed bilomas) or in the free peritoneal cavity (cholascos), abdominal pain, fever, cholestasis, intraoperatively diagnosed choledocholithiasis, and subhepatic abscess in one case. In 19 cases, after fluoroscopic visualization of the biliary tree and the leak, endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed. The biliary leaks were located at the cystic duct remnant (n = 12), at the gallbladder fossa (n = 5), or at lesions at the hepatic or common bile duct (n = 2). In 7 patients residual common bile duct stones were endoscopically removed. Most patients had localized small subhepatic fluid collections (n = 13) and the others had cholascos (n = 6). The leaks closed with endoscopic sphincterotomy alone in 11 patients, 4 patients had endoscopic sphincterotomy plus percutaneous or laparoscopic drainage of the bile collections, and 4 patients underwent laparotomy. All 6 cases with cholascos but only 2 of the 13 patients with localized collections underwent a second therapeutic procedure (drainage, laparotomy). Five of these procedures were performed within 7 days of ERCP, in most cases due to persistent bile leak. We conclude that biliary leakages after laparoscopic cholecystectomy require laparotomy only exceptionally. Endoscopic sphincterotomy, combined with percutaneous drainage in the case of large collections, represents a safe and successful strategy ensuring closure of the leaks in most cases."
CD009323,0,8677681,0,[Laparoscopic therapy of choledocholithiasis].,"The introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has led to controversial discussions about the proceeding in case of coincident common bile duct stones. In our unit choledocholithiasis has been treated laparoscopically since November 1991. Basic requirement has been a routine intraoperative cholangiography. 67 patients with common bile duct stones were treated until January 1995. All patients underwent a follow up and the results were compared to other concepts. In 40 cases common bile duct stones were eliminated via cystic duct and in 27 cases by choledochotomy. The choledochus was drained routinely for postoperative x-ray control. In 9 cases we found residual concrements: 7 patients required postoperative endoscopic papillotomy and in 2 cases the calculi where eliminated with a dormia basket introduced via drainage tube. In one case surgical management was changed to laparotomy. Postoperative complications occurred in 8 cases. One patient suffering from bacterial peritonitis underwent laparotomy on the 9th postoperative day; one with bleeding from the cystic artery was treated by relaparoscopy. One patient developed a liver abscess and two patients a bilioma requiring ultrasound guided drainage. A superficial wound infection in one patient and a biliary leakage after removal of the drainage in two patients healed spontaneously. Due to an intact papilla with less stress to the patient, as well as a complication rate comparable with other published therapeutic concepts, this strategy can be recommended as a valuable alternative procedure."

CD009323,0,8566842,0,Treatment of bile duct lesions after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"From January 1990 to June 1994, 53 patients who sustained bile duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy were treated at the Amsterdam Academic Medical Centre. There were 16 men and 37 women with a mean age of 47 years. Follow up was established in all patients for a median of 17 months. Four types of ductal injury were identified. Type A (18 patients) had leakage from cystic ducts or peripheral hepatic radicles, type B (11 patients) had major bile duct leakage, type C (nine patients) had an isolated ductal stricture, and type D (15 patients) had complete transection of the bile duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) established the diagnosis in all type A, B, and C lesions. In type D lesions percutaneous cholangiography was required to delineate the proximal extent of the injury. Initial treatment (until resolution of symptoms and discharge from hospital) comprised endoscopy in 36 patients and surgery in 26 patients. Endoscopic treatment was possible and successful in 16 of 18 of type A lesions, five of seven of type B lesions, and three of nine of type C lesions. Most failures resulted from inability to pass strictures or leaks at the initial endoscopy. During initial treatment additional surgery was required in seven patients. Fourteen patients underwent percutaneous or surgical drainage of bile collections, or both. After endoscopic treatment early complications occurred in three patients, with a fatal outcome in two (not related to the endoscopic therapy). During follow up six patients developed late complications. All 15 patients with complete transection and four patients with major bile duct leakage were initially treated surgically. During initial treatment additional endoscopy was required in two patients. Early complications occurred in eight patients. During follow up seven patients developed stenosis of the anastomosis or bile duct. Reconstructive surgery in the early postoperative phase was associated with more complications than elective reconstructive surgery. Most type A and B bile duct injuries after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (80%) can be treated endoscopically. In patients with more severe ductal injury (type C and D) reconstructive surgery is eventually required in 70%. Multidisciplinary approach to these lesions is advocated and algorithms for treatment are proposed."

Since then, various gastrointestinal operations have been performed using laparoscopic guidance. Laparoscopic operations must conform to principles for open general surgery, especially in cases of oncologic resection. Procedures for treatment of conditions such as hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux, intractable peptic ulcer disease, bypass for malignant pancreatic obstruction and repair of rectal prolapse have received immediate acceptance. Other procedures, such as Whipple's operation and colectomy for cancer, have met with a more guarded response."

CD009323,0,8746993,0,Management of choledocholithiasis during pregnancy: a new protocol in the laparoscopic era.,"The management of symptomatic cholelithiasis during pregnancy remains a serious and difficult problem. This condition may be further complicated by the presence of common bile duct stones (CBDS). Two cases of CBDS in pregnancy are presented. During the period from August 1990 to June 1994, 1127 consecutive patients underwent LC by a single surgical team. Two (0.2%) of these patients were pregnant and both were found to have choledocholithiasis. One patient's stones were lavaged into the duodenum via the cystic duct and the other patient had transcystic choledochoscopy and transcystic duct tube drainage. The patients were discharged from the hospital on postoperative days 4 and 6, respectively. There were no complications and both successfully carried their pregnancies to term. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) with transcystic common bile duct exploration (TCDE) was advantageous in both patients. Neither patient required an abdominal incision or choledochotomy. Laparoscopic TCDE with or without cystic tube drainage is a viable option in the management of CBDS in the pregnant patient."
CD009323,0,8746989,0,Intraoperative trans-gallbladder cholangiography intended to delineate bile duct anatomy.,"Intraoperative cholangiography has been recommended to lower the incidence and severity of biliary tract injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However a literature review of common bile duct (CBD) injuries does not appear to support this concept. Most cystic duct cholangiographies disclose the injury after the fact. This study was designed to compare the technical difficulties and complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in three groups of patients: Group 1 underwent intraoperative cholangiography through the gallbladder (n = 288), group 2 underwent intraoperative cholangiography through the cystic duct (n = 162), and group 3 did not undergo cholangiography (n = 227). Cholecystectomies were defined as ""difficult"" if there was a need to convert to open procedure in the absence of an accidental complication, or if estimated blood loss was over 100 ml, and/or if operating time was over 2 h. Difficult cholecystectomies were encountered in 34% of patients in group 2 and 28.2% of patients in group 3, but in only 7.6% of patients in group 1. Technical complications (bleeding, bile leak, common bile duct injury, retained common bile duct stones, false positive choledocholithiasis, pancreatitis, and trocar injuries) occurred in 11.7% of cases in group 2, 4.4% in group 3, and in only 1.4% of group 1. Intraoperative cholangiography performed through the gallbladder before any dissection was initiated significantly facilitated the operation and helped decrease the incidence of technical complications."
CD009323,0,8629208,0,Bile leakage following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is now the treatment of choice for gallstones, but there has been concern that bile leakage with LC is more frequent than after open cholecystectomy (OC). We have analyzed our experience of this complication with regard to both its incidence and management. From a consecutive series of 500 LC, in which both operative cholangiography and drainage of the gallbladder bed were routine, bile leakage was identified in ten patients (2%). There was no bile duct injury. Nine of the ten patients presented with bile in the drain within 24 h of operation and one patient presented 1 week after operation with a subphrenic collection. Of the ten patients, five settled spontaneously. Of the five remaining patients, two needed laparotomy--one for a subphrenic collection not responding to percutaneous drainage and one for biliary peritonitis. One patient was treated by relaparoscopy and suture of a duct of Luschka and one patient had successful percutaneous drainage of an infected collection; the fifth patient who presented with a late subphrenic collection of bile was shown at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to have a cystic duct stump leak and was treated with an endoscopic stent. Bile leakage is seen more frequently after LC than OC for reasons that are currently unclear. We believe that the use of routine gallbladder bed drainage is justified for this reason alone. The majority of bile leaks settle either spontaneously or with minimally invasive intervention."

CD009323,0,7570532,0,[Use of growth hormone during catabolic state in a patient in postoperative intensive care].,"Patients in the intensive care unit often enter a catabolic state with significant protein loss, which may increase postoperative complications. Nutritional support alone usually does not reverse a catabolic state and thereby induce a positive protein balance. Recent studies suggest that recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) stimulates protein synthesis and improves protein balance in critically ill patients. An increase in the level of growth hormone often fails to occur in critical illness and injury. We describe the case of a man aged 45 years who underwent laparoscopic fundoplasty for hiatus hernia repair. Because of complications, including perforation of the oesophagus, he entered a sustained catabolic state with negative protein balance and a weight loss approaching 20%. Therefore, on the 29th day after operation we started treatment with rhGH, Norditropin 24 IE/day im. The protein balance became positive three days later. This parameter maintained positive, also after the growth hormone therapy was discontinued 12 days later. The further course was uneventful and the patient was transferred to his local hospital 51 days after the fundoplasty. His condition was improving steadily."

This anatomical configuration can unexpectedly present itself during laparoscopic cholecystectomy without the associated clinical syndrome. Identification of the gallbladder-cystic duct junction may become impossible, leading to dangerous exposure of the common duct.

After introduction of the ultrasonic probe via the umbilical incision, liver, biliary tract, pancreas, kidneys, stomach, and colon were investigated to assess the sonomorphology of these organs and to judge whether or not LUS is a feasible and reliable means for screening the abdominal organs during routine surgery or laparoscopic staging of upper gastrointestinal (GI) tumors. In all cases, a very accurate investigation of these organs was possible, and the laparoscopic procedure was prolonged for only 15 to 20 min. In eight further patients, LUS was performed to investigate pancreatic pathology (six cases), stomach cancer (one patient), and primary hepatocellular carcinoma (one patient). Three additional patients (pancreatic lesions) who underwent intraoperative ultrasonography with the LUS probe were excluded from this evaluation."

The procedure was carried out in a 14-kg 6-year-old girl with a congenital choledochal cyst of the first type, according to the Alonso-Lej classification. The cyst was divided using a Multifire EndoGIA 30 stapler. Hepatic-jejunal and jejunojejunal anastomoses were made with 4.0 chrome catgut interrupted sutures. Intestinal recanalization occurred on the 2nd postoperative day and the postoperative course was uneventful. The laparoscopic approach affords several advantages: excellent intraoperative visualization of tiny structures and, therefore, great surgical accuracy; early resumption of peristalsis; no postoperative pain; no laparocele; prevention of adhesions; excellent esthetics; and quicker resumption of school and sports activities."
CD009323,0,8740683,0,The role of relaparoscopy in the management of bile leaks after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"The incidence of bile leaks has increased with the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The present paper is focused on bile leaks--their diagnosis and management approaches with special consideration to relaparoscopy. From February 1992 to May 1995 a total of 1223 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed in two hospitals. Eight biliary leaks were found in the series under study (i.e. 0.65%). The diagnosis was confirmed by means of ultrasound, CT scans and ERCP. Three leaks resolved spontaneously on external drains placed during the operation. Two and three patients underwent laparotomy and relaparoscopy, respectively. The etiology of the leakage included three cases of ducts of Luschka, one cystic duct leak, and one retained CBD stone. the source of the remaining leaks was not determined. In all cases the management approaches comprised relaparoscopy and laparotomy. It may be concluded that an early diagnosis and management of bile leaks after laparoscopic cholecystectomies would prevent further complications."

We report here on a patient with unremarkable preoperative workup and normal intraoperative anatomy of the cystic pedicle in whom a type I choledochal cyst containing a large stone was detected by the combined use of laparoscopic contact ultrasonography and intraoperative cholangiography. This case report highlights the importance of intraoperative imaging modalities of the ductal system not only in preventing iatrogenic injuries and their related complications, but also in detecting unsuspected associated biliary pathology which might significantly change the course of surgical intervention."
CD009323,0,8553206,0,Biliary tract complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy are detected more frequently with routine intraoperative cholangiography.,"Controversy over whether intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) should be done routinely has intensified since the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). As yet, no study has demonstrated a clear benefit to its use, although their have been suggestions in the literature that routine use may confer an advantage to detection of injuries. One-hundred seventy-seven biliary tract complications occurring secondary to LC were identified from the combined data of seven institutions. The goal of this retrospective study was to examine the impact of IOC on the occurrence, recognition, and correction of such complications. The complications identified include 39 cystic duct leaks, 69 major ductal leaks or strictures, and 69 major ductal transection or excision injuries. Whether IOC was performed was known in 157 (88%) patients with 53 patients definitely having and 104 not having an IOC. Data concerning IOC were unavailable in 20 cases. More injuries were detected intraoperatively in the group having IOC (P < 0.001). Conversion of the LC to a laparotomy, often for repair of the injury, occurred more commonly in the group having a correctly interpreted IOC (P < 0.001). Conversion resulted in detection of injuries sooner, resulting in fewer operative procedures to correct the injury (P < 0.001). A transecting injury was prevented in at least seven patients when no visualization of the proximal biliary tree was documented by IOC. These partial ductal incisions were treated by t-tube placement. Incorrect interpretation of the IOC occurred in at least eight patients, with no identification of the proximal biliary tree in six.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Both patients were treated successfully with endoscopic sphincterotomy, as have most such patients reported in the literature. Although clip migration can occur after both open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, there is some evidence that this complication may be more common after the laparoscopic procedure. Clip migration can be diagnosed before cholangiography by carefully reviewing plain abdominal films and CT scans. ERCP confirms the diagnosis, and sphincterotomy with clip and stone removal is the therapeutic procedure of choice. Additional surgical procedures only rarely are required."

CD009323,0,7482208,0,Sutured or fibrin-glued laparoscopic choledochojejunostomy.,"Minimally invasive techniques for choledochojejunostomy offer theoretical advantages for palliating unresectable periampullary neoplasms. Fibrin glue, a biologic adhesive containing concentrated fibrinogen, may obviate suturing and promote healing without stricture formation. We examined the technical ability to perform laparoscopic choledochojejunostomy (LCJ) and the applicability of thrombin-activated fibrin glue in an animal model of biliary obstruction. Domestic pigs underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and ligation of the distal bile duct. Three days later, a side-to-side LCJ was performed by intracorporeal sutured anastomosis (n = 7) or using four stay sutures and homologous fibrin glue (n = 7). Control animals underwent a similar bypass via open laparotomy (n = 7). The postoperative interval to ambulation and oral intake was recorded, and serial serum liver enzymes were measured. The animals were sacrificed at 6 weeks, and tensile strength of the anastomoses was assessed by tensometry. Liver function tests returned to normal values within 7 days following all methods of choledochojejunostomy. In the fibrin glue group, three anastomotic leaks (43%) occurred in the 1st postoperative week. At 6 weeks, all other anastomoses were intact and patent by cholangiogram, but there was moderate stenosis of two open and one fibrin-glue anastomosis. The sutured LCJ, while taking approximately 1 h longer to perform (P < 0.05), resulted in similar efficacy and more rapid recovery (P < 0.05) than open biliary-enteric bypass. Fibrin-glued LCJ was performed rapidly, but had less tensile strength (P < 0.05) and often leaked in the early post-operative interval. We conclude that while there may be a role for laser-activated solders for primary anastomosis, thrombin-activated fibrinogen cannot be advocated as the primary means of creating biliary anastomoses. Using intracorporeal suturing techniques, laparoscopic choledochojejunostomy may be performed safely."

Tumor size and location have a major influence on the feasibility of a laparoscopic operation. Isolation and ligation of blood vessels and bile ducts after selective liver dissection by suitable techniques are important for visual control of the operating field. Since the Jet-Cutter has proven to give excellent clinical results in conventional liver surgery, we carried out laparoscopic liver resections with the Jet-Cutter in six patients. Five tumors were located in the left liver lobe; the fifth was in segment 6. There were no intra- or postoperative complications. The patients were discharged from the hospital after a mean of 5.4 +/- 2.1 days."

Intraoperative findings and postoperative complications.,"From November 1990 to April 1994 we attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in 1,788 consecutive patients. The intraoperative findings related to gallbladder's pathology were as following: chronic cholecystitis in 792 patients (44.3%), simple cholecystolithiasis in 760 (42.5%), acute cholecystitis in 98 (5.5%), hydrops in 44 (2.5%), empyema in 38 (2.1%), gangrenous cholecystitis in 12 patients, acalculous cholecystitis in 20 patients, polyps in 11 patients, adenomyomatosis in 9 patients, and gallbladder's carcinoma in 4 patients. Although we had a considerable number of cases with severe inflammation and/or dense adhesions the conversion rate to open surgery was relatively low (2.5%). There was no procedure-related mortality and no common bile duct injury. Postoperative complications occurred in 58 patients (3.2%). Bile leak was present in 19 patients, retained bile duct stones in 8, severe bleeding in 6, mild pancreatitis in 4, pulmonary embolism in 1, cerebral bleeding in 1, wound infection in 6, abdominal wall hematoma in 4, and umbilical incisional hernia in 2; 7 patients presented other minor complications. The mean postoperative hospital stay of our patients was 1.8 days (range 1-12 days). Adequate measures to prevent intraoperative accidents, meticulous technique, and full maintenance of the equipment are among the most important factors in keeping a low conversion and complication rate in the patients undergoing LC."

Metastases were 2.4 times more common in tumours of the distal pancreas (11 of 25, 44 per cent) than in pancreatic head tumours (16 of 89, 18 per cent) (P < 0.05). None of the 27 patients with metastases underwent further surgery. Of the 87 patients without metastatic spread, 42 were found to have vascular invasion by angiography and were offered radiation therapy. Thirty of 40 patients explored surgically were resected; two of the remaining ten had peritoneal spread that had been missed at laparoscopy (false-negative rate of 7 per cent). Cytological examination of peritoneal washings was performed in 94 patients at the time of laparoscopy; cytology was positive in 16 (17 per cent). There was a significant correlation between positive cytology and presence of visible liver or peritoneal metastases (ten of 22 with metastases versus six of 72 without, P < 0.001). Positive cytology was present in six patients (8 per cent) without visible metastases, but none had resectable disease."
CD009323,0,7639238,0,Advantages of sphincterotomy and nasobiliary tube drainage in the treatment of cystic duct stump leak complicating laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"We have used sphincterotomy and nasobiliary tube drainage in preference to other forms of endoscopic therapy to manage three cases of cystic duct stump leak complicating laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The ability to monitor daily nasobiliary tube output and to perform repeat cholangiograms without subjecting the patients to multiple endoscopies permitted precise determination of cystic duct stump leak closure and timely discharge. We observed that an approximate doubling of the 24-h nasobiliary tube output coincided with closure of the cystic duct stump leak at cholangiography. Bile ascites was present in two of the cases and was conveniently removed by CT-guided placement of peritoneal drains. All cystic duct stump leaks sealed after 5 days of nasobiliary tube drainage. The advantages of sphincterotomy and nasobiliary tube drainage include precise determination of cystic duct leak closure, final device removal without follow-up endoscopy, and ongoing decompression of the biliary tree after removal of the nasobiliary tube."

In model A (n = 10), biliary bypass was a Roux-en-Y loop for cholecystojejunostomy after choledochal clip occlusion. In model B (n = 10) an additional Roux-en-Y loop was attached to the stomach after transection of the duodenum. Model A showed functioning biliary bypass with patent and leak-free anastomoses at necropsy on day 28. In model B, four pigs were sacrificed earlier, but nine had normal functioning double bypass (two intussusceptions of the ileum, one bleeding ulcer at the gastroenterostomy, one necrotic Roux-en-Y-loop). Based on the presented bypass function, we are encouraged to perform laparoscopic biliary and gastroenteral bypass in humans to treat malignant jaundice and gastric outlet obstruction."

Our experience].,"Cholangiography during conventional cholecystectomy has always been useful for anatomo-topographic study and for research of the stones of biliary tree. After a natural period of training the authors included the easy technique of cholangiography in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The study was performed in 13 patients using Olsen's cannula with an internal a normal catheter for cholangiography. The catheterization of the cystic duct was performed in 85% of cases (11 patients), in the other 15% (2 patients) it was not possible to cannulate the cystic duct. Non complication. The mean duration of the study was 14 minutes.

CD009323,0,7648125,0,Management of bile leaks after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"The success of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been tarnished by the increased risk of bile duct damage associated with the operation. Many of these injuries can be managed by endoscopic techniques. Experience of such injuries between 1991 and 1994 was reviewed. Twenty-four patients were referred: 11 with injuries to the cystic duct alone, five with complete hepatic duct obstruction and eight with high bile duct leaks. All patients with leaks from the cystic duct were managed successfully endoscopically (sphincterotomy, four; stent, seven) without recourse to further surgery. Patients with complete obstruction were aided in their recovery by endoscopic and percutaneous techniques, either for postoperative problems (two patients) or in preparation for surgery (three). The eight patients with high bile duct leaks were managed endoscopically by stenting (seven patients) or sphincterotomy (one). Stenting appeared to encourage leaks to heal better than sphincterotomy alone; stents should probably be left in situ for 2 months before removal. There were no deaths and all but one patient had normal biliary function at follow-up. It is suggested that all suspected injuries after biliary surgery require management by a combination of interventional radiology and endoscopic interventional techniques. Surgery may be required only if there is complete obstruction of the biliary tree."
CD009323,0,7611975,0,Minimal access surgery of the gastrointestinal tract.,"In the last 5 years, surgery of the gastrointestinal tract has been revolutionized by the application of minimal access techniques. Following initial enthusiasm, which suggested that most abdominal surgery would ultimately be done via this approach, there is now need for appraisal and evaluation of the role of a number of these minimal access techniques when compared with open surgery. Undoubtedly, the most convincing and total application of minimal access techniques has been in the treatment of gallstone disease. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now standard therapy for cholelithiasis and endoscopic sphincterotomy with stone extraction is standard therapy for choledocholithiasis. Where the two conditions co-exist, operative cholangiography allows for the recognition of stones in the bile duct at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and provides the potential avenue for treatment. Most major centres also would recommend routine operative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the detection of unsuspected stones and as an extra safety procedure in the early identification of potential bile duct injuries. The efficacy of laparoscopic appendicectomy and laparoscopic or thoracoscopic treatment of achalasia of the oesophagus also is supported by data from well conducted prospective studies. Doubt remains regarding the advantage of laparoscopic surgery over other approaches in the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux, inguinal hernias and jaundice due to non-resectable cancer. For all three of these conditions, prospective trials are underway and the results of these trials should be assessed prior to widespread adoption of the laparoscopic techniques.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009323,0,7574315,0,Open cholecystectomy in the age of the laparoscope.,"We reviewed our experience with open cholecystectomy since laparoscopic cholecystectomy became the treatment of choice for symptomatic gallstones. Over a 3 year period 35 open (6%) and 578 laparoscopic cholecystectomies (94%) were performed. Fourteen trainee surgeons performed only 16 open cholecystectomies and assisted at 19. The proportion of open cholecystectomies declined through the study period. Ten emergency cholecystectomies were performed for empyema, gallbladder perforation, severe acute cholecystitis, liver abscess, and cholangitis. In 12 patients, laparoscopic surgery was converted to an open procedure because of severe inflammation, empyema, dense adhesions, carcinoma of the gallbladder, cholecystoduodenal fistula, and perforated small bowel. Ten patients underwent open cholecystectomy and bile duct exploration after failure to clear duct stones endoscopically, and three patients had Mirizzi's syndrome. Open cholecystectomy is infrequently performed giving trainee surgeons little experience. However, such cases are occasionally inevitable and laparoscopic surgeons need to have the appropriate skills."
CD009323,0,7560834,0,Evolving strategies for the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. A review.,"Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas has an incidence of only 0.01%, yet is the fourth leading cause of cancer death for American men and women. Despite this dismal outlook, new strategies for staging and therapy for pancreatic cancer have emerged over the last few years. Laparoscopy with cytologic evaluation of peritoneal washings, and more recently, although still investigational, endoscopic and intracorporeal ultrasonography have provided more detailed staging information. The result of improved staging is earlier, more accurate selection of treatment most appropriate for stage of disease. For those patients with clinically localized disease, laparotomy with an attempt at resection is indicated, particularly with the recent trend in declining morbidity and operative mortality the recent trend in declining morbidity and operative mortality associated with pancreatectomy. With clinically unresectable disease, patients may potentially be spared the morbidity of laparotomy. Advances in therapeutic endoscopic and percutaneous manipulation of the obstructed biliary tree have provided an alternative to surgery and improved quality of life for patients with abbreviated life spans. Gastroduodenal obstruction has traditionally been managed by laparotomy, although with improved technology and surgical skill, a laparoscopic approach may become standard. Because even at presentation pancreatic cancer is rarely a localized process but is a disseminated disease, surgery alone is unlikely to increase survival rates in the absence of adjuvant therapies. Present and future strategies for treatment include the addition of neoadjuvant regimens and adjuvant modalities including intraoperative radiation, photodynamic therapy, intraperitoneal therapies, and pancreatic and splanchnic perfusion. Clearly, the greatest strides in treatment of pancreatic cancer will come with development of new agents with significantly greater antitumor efficacy."
CD009323,0,7596596,0,[The role of sonography in laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,"Between January 1991. and December 1993. in the 3rd Surgical Department of Semmelweis Medical University 735 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed. Intraoperative and postoperative complications occurred in 2.7% and 3% respectively. Conversion to open procedure was necessary in 8.4%, reintervention was indicated in 2.3%. The total occurrence of common bile duct stones was noticed in 1.6%. The incidence of bile duct injury 0.54%. The role of sonography in laparoscopic cholecystectomy is multiple: patient-selection, diagnosis of complications, ultrasound guided interventions in cases of complications, follow up of patients. The authors compared in 419 cases the preoperative sonography with the intraoperative finding. The risk of intra- and postoperative complications was significantly higher if the stone was impacted into the cystic region, if the gallbladder was enlarged, especially with wall-thickening and signs of acute inflammation. The fibrosis and scarring of gallbladder represent an increased risk as well. The accuracy in estimation of common bile duct dilatation is very high, but in the judgement of bile duct stones there was a high false positive rate. In spite of this, the echography is very well applicable for patient-selection. In the patient group selected with positive sonographical finding for open cholecystectomy, the prevalence of common bile duct stones was 25%, compared with 1.6% in laparoscopic group. In cases of postoperative complications the diagnostic sonography may be followed with ultrasound-guided puncture and/or drainage."

CD009323,0,10401074,0,Open Operations on the Bile Duct for Stones.,"The management of bile duct stones attained an acceptable plateau of development in the late 1980s, with the majority of bile duct stones removed by open exploration and the difficult stone delegated to the endoscopist. This situation was disturbed by the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy; it was no longer straightforward policy to explore the bile duct, and alternatives had to be considered. Open operation may now be required (1) if an unexpected stone is found during laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a small cystic duct, (2) if laparoscopic choledochotomy is undertaken and technical problems are encountered, (3) when stones in the duct cannot be removed endoscopically, (4) by preference of the surgeon on the basis of similar risk factors, (5) in the sick patient with cholangitis, and (6) after technical failure of endoscopic sphincterotomy. The technique of open operation must be meticulous and should preferably be performed with choledochoscopy either peroperatively or postoperatively. The open technique for bile duct exploration continues to have a role, and when performed expertly, its morbidity and mortality will be similar to the endoscopic and laparoscopic techniques."
CD009323,0,10401073,0,Peroperative Endoscopic Sphincterotomy.,"A major aim in the treatment of bile duct stones detected at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be to remove the stones during the same operation. In most instances, and for patients with small stones, this aim can be achieved using techniques through the cystic duct. In patients in whom these techniques failed, the role of a duodenal approach for removing the stones was evaluated by performing perendoscopic sphincterotomy (PES) and clearing the bile duct via this route. In an initial series of 13 patients, it was demonstrated that perendoscopic sphincterotomy and extraction of stones from the bile duct can be effectively performed in patients in the supine position with minimal interference to the laparoscopic cholecystectomy operation. The perendoscopic approach does not add to the complication rate of the operation, and short-term follow-up of patients indicates no significant postoperative sequalae. This approach adds to the various techniques being developed for the minimal-access approach to the treatment of bile duct stones."

Agenesis is usually discovered at laparotomy for cholecystectomy since ultrasound examination of a patient with suggestive symptoms not visualizing the gallbladder is compatible with chronic cholecystitis (shrunken gallbladder). The surgeon must prove agenesis by thoroughly examining the most common sites for ectopic gallbladders and by performing intraoperative cholangiograms.

All patients without histologically proven metastases proceeded to laparotomy. Seventy patients were eligible for evaluation. Sixteen of the 21 patients with distant metastases were diagnosed by laparoscopy with ultrasonography. Forty-nine patients had surgical exploration and trial dissection to assess local resectability. Twenty-nine patients (41 per cent) had resectable pancreatic head tumours. The positive predictive value of local ingrowth as determined by laparoscopic sonography was 93 per cent.

This syndrome is described either as an acute form due only to extrinsic compression of the common bile duct (type I) or as a chronic form resulting in an erosive cholecysto-choledochal fistula (type II). Up to date, the syndrome remains a clinically and surgically challenging problem. The anatomic basic of the syndrome (an anomalous relationship between the cystic duct and the common hepatic duct) when associated with inflammation and interbiliary fistula predisposes to a critical situation to be clearly detected and contributes to technical difficulties when surgical management is performed. The operative diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome remains elusive and requires careful scrutiny of the biliary tract imaging to recognize the diseased duct system and to facilitate the following operative procedures. The surgical treatment requires a skill and careful operative dissection of the duct system, cholecystectomy and a safe biliary exploration and stone clearance, avoiding any iatrogenic damage to common hepatic duct. Laparotomy is commonly advocated as the safer approach to the diseased biliary tract and it is still employed by most authors. The laparoscopic surgery has not yet entered as the first-choice procedure for this syndrome due to jaundice and acute inflammation considered by some as contraindication to mini-invasive treatment.

Laparoscopy showed a fixed large endometrioma firmly attached to pelvic peritoneum and intestines in the pelvic cavity, and significant adhesions in the upper part of a midline incision from prior abdominal hysterectomy. These midabdominal adhesions were not released. The patient underwent laparoscopic bilateral adnexectomy as an outpatient. Two days later she was admitted with small bowel obstruction. Thirty-nine days later, diagnostic evaluation revealed urinary ascites with right ureteral stricture at the uterine artery level, and complete ligation and resection of the left ureter at the pelvic brim near the infundibulopelvic ligament stump.

The gallbladder could be seen in 86.2% of cases with DIC-SCT and in 63.8% of cases with conventional DIC. The junction between the cystic duct and the common bile duct could be seen in 18 of 58 cases with DIC and in 49 of 58 cases with DIC-SCT. The DIC-SCT showed significantly superior anatomical details compared with images with conventional DIC. A comparison of DIC, ERC and DIC-SCT revealed that the junction between the cystic duct and the common bile duct could be identified in 14 of 16 cases undergoing ERC, in 13 of 16 cases receiving DIC-SCT and in 4 of 16 cases receiving DIC.

CD009323,0,7726672,0,General stress response to conventional and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"In many retrospective and prospective observational studies, laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) compares favorably with conventional cholecystectomy (CC), with respect to length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, and pulmonary function, indicating a diminished operative trauma. Comparison of laboratory findings (stress hormones, blood glucose, interleukins) are a possibility to objectify stress and tissue trauma of laparoscopic and conventional cholecystectomy."

CD009323,0,7545828,0,Palliation of advanced gastric cancer by laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy.,"Palliation of unresectable gastric carcinoma by conventional gastrojejunostomy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy may be an alternative as it can achieve the same results with less morbidity. This is a case report of a 68-year-old man with an obstructed, unresectable gastric carcinoma that has metastasized to the lungs and liver. Attempt at laser boring was unsuccessful. Laparoscopic assessment revealed an immobile tumour fixed to the pancreas. A totally intraabdominal laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy was fashioned with endoGIAs (USSC Norwalk, CT). Operation time was 85 minutes. He was able to tolerate feeds on the 3rd postoperative day (POD), diet on the 5th POD and was discharged on the 8th POD. Satisfactory palliation at home was achieved for ten weeks before death. Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy is thus a good option for palliation of obstructed advanced gastric cancer."
CD009323,0,7887534,0,1525 laparoscopic cholecystectomies without biliary injury: a single institution's experience.,"Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC) has become the preferred treatment of gallbladder disease. The indications for LC remain unchanged from those for open cholecystectomy (OC). A total of 1525 patients underwent LC at Georgia Baptist Medical Center between December 1989 and December 1992. The procedure was completed in 1,492 patients (97.8%) and required conversion to OC in 33 patients (2.2%). Selective intraoperative cholangiography was used in 165 patients (10.8%). Overall morbidity was 4.06%, and there were four deaths not operatively related, for a 0.26% mortality rate. There have been no biliary ductal injuries. The average hospital stay was 0.82 days, with 37.4% of the patients going home as true outpatients and 44.5% going home on postop Day one. Most published series on LC report a small incidence of biliary injury. We feel that with meticulous dissection of the cystic duct and use of selective intraoperative cholangiography to define unsure anatomy, biliary injury can be minimized."

Localized dilatation of the intrahepatic bile-ducts are infrequent. They may be associated with others pathological conditions such as cystic dilatation of the extrahepatic bile-ducts, congenital hepatic fibrosis of the liver or renal pathology. Hepatic resection is the logical treatment of such localized lesions, but it may have an excessive risk in case of association with a congenital hepatic fibrosis of the liver. The authors insist about the necessity of radiographic exploration during every biliary surgical approach, even with laparoscopic technic."
CD009323,0,7772812,0,Current applicability of duplex Doppler ultrasonography in pancreatic head and biliary malignancies.,"In most patients with a pancreatic head carcinoma or a cholangiocarcinoma of the liver (Klatskin tumour) US is the first imaging modality. Tumour detection using US can exceed that of CT. For small tumours, endosonography or ERCP is recommended. Enlarged lymph nodes are not a major diagnostic parameter, because a reliable differentiation between reactive and malignant lymph nodes is generally not possible. Very tiny liver and peritoneal metastases are missed by the current imaging modalities including US and only detectable by laparoscopy and/or laparoscopic US. Tumour involvement of the portal venous system is an important determinant for irresectability which can often be assessed by duplex Doppler US obviating invasive or expensive imaging modalities. In pancreatic head carcinoma an abnormal pulsed Doppler signal is highly suspicious for involvement of the portal venous system. However, a normal pulsed Doppler signal does not exclude involvement at all. In Klatskin tumour, Doppler US had an accuracy of 91% compared with surgical findings in predicting portal venous involvement. In most cases of pancreatic head carcinoma or Klatskin tumour, US can assess irresectability. However, assessment of curative resectability in these tumours remains a problem."
CD009323,0,7754633,0,Preoperative combined modality therapy for pancreatic cancer.,"Combined modality therapy can be administered prior to surgical resection for patients with operable pancreatic cancer. One important criteria used to select patients for this treatment sequence is the absence of arterial vascular encasement by tumor on thin-section CT scanning; the absence of peritoneal seeding on surgical staging or laparoscopy has been another important parameter used in identifying patients with ""localized"" disease. Preoperative treatment with infusional chemoradiation uses multiple fields of irradiation delivering a dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions over 5 1/2 weeks. This is done in conjunction with a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil intravenously at a dosage of 300 mg/m2/day with each day of radiotherapy treatment. The initial results of this protocol indicate acceptable toxicity and no evidence of increased perioperative morbidity or mortality compared to series using operation alone. We conclude that nearly all patients eligible for this combined modality treatment approach complete therapy as prescribed with acceptable toxicity."
CD009323,0,7668495,0,Acute biliary pancreatitis.,"The development of acute pancreatitis occurs in 4-8% of patients with symptomatic gallstones. Individuals predisposed to acute pancreatitis tend to have small gallstones (with or without larger gallstones), a wide cystic duct and a common channel between the biliary and pancreatic ducts. The importance of this relationship is demonstrated by the ability of urgent endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) to improve the outcome of a predicted severe attack and to virtually abolish recurrent attacks in patients who are unable to undergo cholecystectomy. Cholesterolosis is an established cause of acute pancreatitis, occurring in up to 29% of cases with cholesterolosis. Biliary crystals are an important marker of microlithiasis or a propensity to form further gallstones following their passage into the duodenum following an attack. A combination of ultrasonography and a serum liver transaminase of > 60 IU/I (< 48 hr o an attack) are necessary to provide optimum sensitivity and specificity for gallstones as a prompt for the use of ERCP and ES in severe cases. Biliary sludge as a cause of acute pancreatitis is not proven. 25-30% of patients will develop complications with a mortality of around 8%. Urgent diagnosis of gallstones and treatment by ES can result in substantial improvement in outcome."
CD009323,0,7653977,0,"A two-year experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy--a report of 1475 cases from Kunming, China.","Over a 2-year period, from 12 September 1991 to 11 September 1993, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed on 1475 patients with benign gallbladder disease in Kunming General Hospital, Yunnan, China. Of these, 28 cases (1.9%) were converted to open surgery. Various complications were documented in 27 instances including extrahepatic bile duct injury in 4 cases (0.3%), postoperative haemorrhage requiring laparotomy in 3 cases (0.2%) and bile leak from cystic duct stump in 1 case (0.07%). There was 1 (0.07%) death in the series. The junction between the gallbladder infundibulum and the cystic duct is an important landmark which laparoscopic surgeons must identify in the course of the procedure. Because the junction remains a comparatively constant landmark, in difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomy, excessive dissection of the bile duct would be unnecessary. During dissection of the hepatic hilus, blund dissection is recommended and the blind use of cautery and haemostasis should be avoided."
CD009323,0,7621287,0,[The endoscopic treatment of postcholecystectomy biliary leakage].,"Although there is a decrease in the total number of complications observed on performance of laparoscopy cholecystectomy (LC) there does appear to be an increase in biliary tract lesions. Seven cases of postcholecystectomy biliary leakage treated with endoscopic methods are presented. These cases include 4 patients with leakage from the cystic canal stump and 3 with leakage from the common bile duct. In 5 cases the biliary tract lesion occurred following LC, 1 after conventional cholecystectomy and in 1 reconverted LP. CPRE identified the site of the leakage in the 7 patients and in 2 residual choledocholithiasis. In 5 cases treatment consisted in endoscopic papillotomy and placement of biliary endoprosthesis while only papillotomy was performed in 2 patients. In one of these cases CPRE was repeated and the sphincterotomy widened due to persistence of the leakage at 5 days, with the same finally closing at 15 days of the second CPRE. Closure of the biliary leakage was obtained in the other 6 cases in less than 72 hours post-CPRE. No complications secondary to the technique were observed. It was concluded that CPRE together with endoscopic papillotomy and placement of biliary prostheses is an effective and safe treatment for postcholecystectomy biliary leakages of the common bile duct or cystic duct."

CD009323,0,7700622,0,[Cholecystectomy performed by macro- and modern mini-laparotomy].,"The conventional and laparoscopic cholecystectomy is as already every day utilized method, the operation procedure is well developed and the instruments used allow a reliable operation. The cholecystectomy performed by minilaparotomy is not yet a widespread procedure, since there is no established method and the instruments needed are not readily available, as well as the fact that special complications' rates is not yet well known. In order to further elaborate on the procedure and to demonstrate it's true value, 710 micro- and modern minilaparotomies, without exclusion or selection, were analyzed and the operation procedures were then summarized. The operations were completed with microlaparotomy (smaller than 4 cm incisions) in 643 cases (90.6%) with modern minilaparotomies (4.1-6 cm) in 61 cases (8.6%), with conventional mini (6.1-10 cm), and the incisions longer than 10 cm with conventional laparotomies in 3-3 instances (0.4-0.4%). We performed a complete cholecystectomy in 97.2%, a longer cystic stumps was left in 1.7%, subtotal and partial cholecystectomies in 0.7% and 0.3% respectively. In 69 of the cases (9.7%) simultaneous choledocholithiasis was discovered and resolved. 21.2% of the operations were termed as difficult. 2/3 of the intra and postoperative complications as well as early reoperations occured in cases where they followed a delayed operation of obstructive cholecystitis. One patient was lost (0.14%) due to non-surgical complication. These experiences show that cholecystectomy performed by micro and modern minilaparotomy is a realistic alternatives to the conventional and laparoscopic cholecystectomies."
CD009323,0,9050563,0,Laparoscopic removal of a benign pelvic retroperitoneal dermoid cyst.,"Retroperitoneal tumors are rare, often malignant, and difficult to diagnose. Surgical removal is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We believe this to be the first report of laparoscopic removal of a benign pelvic retroperitoneal dermoid cyst from the right pararectal and presacral areas. Iatrogenic enterocele was prevented by laparoscopic suturing and knot tying to perform a modified McCall culdoplasty. The excellent outcome of this case suggests that laparoscopic management should be considered for carefully selected benign retroperitoneal tumors."

A new technique for the management of complex choledocholithiasis.,Laparoscopic antegrade sphincterotomy represents a new technique that expands the ability of the surgeon to manage complex choledocholithiasis at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The authors describe their experience with six patients with cholelithiasis and complex common bile duct stone disease who underwent successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy and antegrade sphincterotomies.
CD009323,0,7855984,0,Laparoscopic enterolysis and placement of an intestinal sling before radiation therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.,We present an interesting application of laparoscopy in a man who was otherwise not a candidate for radiotherapy because of an adherent loop of small bowel in the proposed treatment field. Laparoscopic enterolysis was performed and the involved segment was displaced out of the pelvis; a synthetic mesh was placed to serve as a sling to prevent caudal migration back into the pelvis. The patient had a rapid recovery and subsequently completed a full course of radiotherapy. The experienced laparoscopist may find this a good alternative to open surgery in patients with a fixed loop of small bowel who require radiation therapy for pelvic malignancies.

CD009323,0,7749706,0,Three-dimensional reconstruction of the biliary tract using spiral computed tomography.,"Spiral computed tomography (SCT) is a recently introduced technique which enables scanning of one large volume with no interscan intervals. Three-dimensional reconstruction using this technique is emerging as an effective means of identifying complex anatomical relationships. Ninety-two patients with cholecystolithiasis including ten with choledocholithiasis were investigated. All underwent SCT after oral and intravenous infusion cholangiography (IVC-SCT) and 22 were also examined by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC). IVC-SCT showed significantly more anatomical detail than conventional intravenous infusion cholangiography (IVC). The junction between the cystic duct and the common bile duct could be identified before surgery in 19 of 22 patients undergoing ERC, in 18 of 22 receiving IVC-SCT and in five of 22 undergoing IVC. Significant differences were noted between IVC-SCT, ERC and conventional IVC. Three-dimensional surface reconstruction of the biliary tract is useful in the evaluation of anatomical relationships between the cystic duct and the common bile duct (clearly seen in 86 per cent of cases). Three-dimensional reconstruction using SCT scanning is useful for anatomical assessment before laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,7749674,0,Laparoscopic colonic surgery.,"Laparoscopic surgical techniques have recently entered the field of colorectal surgery. Because the laparoscopic approach has revolutionized biliary surgery, it is hoped that similar advances will be possible in the more elderly population with colorectal disease. Early experience suggests that such advances have not been achieved and there is concern about developing minimal access surgical techniques in the face of potentially curable cancer. This article reviews the current state of knowledge based on published series; however, the current lack of controlled data in patients with extended follow-up makes this area highly controversial. Suggestions regarding the future of laparoscopic surgery are made and include the establishment of a national register and the development of controlled randomized trials."
CD009323,0,7738737,0,Stapled intestinal anastomosis in neonates and infants: use of the endoscopic intestinal stapler.,"Stapled anastomoses of the gastrointestinal tract, commonplace in adults and older children, are rarely performed in newborns because of the size of the instruments. The development of smaller stapling devices for laparoscopic and thoracoscopic procedures presented an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of such anastomoses in neonates and infants. Over an 11-month period, seven newborn or young infants underwent stapled functional end-to-end small or large intestinal anastomoses using the Endo-GIA 30. The male:female ratio was 3:4, and the mean age was 72d (range, 1 to 134 days). The mean weight at the time of the stapled anastomosis was 3.7 kg (range, 1.88 to 6.6 kg). The clinical setting requiring the intestinal anastomoses included ileostomy closure after perforated necrotizing enterocolitis (3), intestinal atresia (1), distal ileal volvulus (1), left colon mesenteric cyst (1), and biliary atresia (1). There were no deaths or anastomotic leaks. Nasogastric decompression was discontinued at a mean of 6 days (range, 3 to 11 days), and oral feedings were begun at a mean of 7.0 days (range, 4 to 12 days). The patients were discharged from the hospital 7 to 117 days after the operation (mean, 33 days). The endoscopic stapling instrument is safe and effective in performing small and large intestinal anastomoses in newborns and young infants."
CD009323,0,7725758,0,[Clip migration in the common bile duct and consecutive calculus formation after laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,"In 1991 a 64-year old woman underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. The follow-up was uneventful. Two years later a painless obstructive jaundice appeared. Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography revealed a freely floating surgical clip within the common bile duct. It was a FILSHIE-Clip, commonly used to ligate the cystic duct. The endoscopic extraction of the foreign body was unsuccessful because the clip slipped into a small intrahepatic bile duct. Smaller gallstones that had probably crystallized around the clip could be extracted. Finally the clip itself disappeared spontaneously after endoscopic sphincterotomy through the papilla. It is discussed why movement of a surgical clip into the common bile duct appears after laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,7725683,0,Prospective evaluation of the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic jejunostomy.,"We prospectively assessed the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic jejunostomy done by 11 surgeons in 8 medical centers using the T-fastener technique. In all, 23 men and 13 women aged 19 to 84 (mean, 59) years required enteral feeding, but could not undergo gastrostomy and had no contraindication to laparoscopy. Of these patients, 12 had head and neck cancer and 11 had neurologic swallowing dysfunction. The procedure took 25 to 180 minutes (mean, 75). Three (8%) early cases were converted to open jejunostomy because of accidental enterotomies caused by inappropriate techniques that were avoided in later cases. Minor technical problems, such as passing a needle through the back wall of the jejunum, occurred in 7 patients, but they were easily corrected and produced no complications. Feedings were routinely begun within 24 hours of the surgical procedure. All jejunostomy catheters functioned well. This is a safe and effective technique when done by experienced laparoscopic surgeons, and serious complications are rare."
CD009323,0,7597589,0,Use of laparoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with surgical abdominal sepsis.,"Patients often present to the surgeon with abdominal pain, tenderness, and fever. Many exhibit progressive sepsis due to abdominal pathology. Delay in diagnosis and treatment often occurs due to the use of multiple, time-consuming, expensive diagnostic studies. We delineate the use of diagnostic laparoscopy in subsets of patients in whom confusion exists as to the cause of abdominal sepsis--i.e., females in child-bearing years, elderly patients, obese patients, immunosuppressed patients, and patients with suppression of physical findings. The methodical assessment of the entire abdominal cavity is performed utilizing manipulation of the patient's position (Trendelenburg, supine, reverse Trendelenburg, left side up, right side up) and meticulous inspection of the entire small bowel. Diagnoses included acute appendicitis, gangrenous appendicitis, perforated appendicitis with peritonitis or abscess, gangrenous cholecystitis, ischemic bowel disease, perforating carcinoma of the colon, perforating diverticulitis with abscess or peritonitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, closed-loop small-bowel obstruction, megacolon, and perforation of the colon. Laparoscopic treatment of 96% of the patients was performed successfully and a laparoscopic-assisted approach was used in the remainder. There was one mortality (cardiac) and no major morbidity. The development of a Formal Diagnostic Exploratory Laparoscopic (FDEL) approach has aided in the assessment of each of the diagnoses of sepsis in the abdominal cavity. The diagnostic and therapeutic approach laparoscopically avoids extensive preoperative studies, avoids delay in operative intervention, and appears to minimize morbidity and shorten the postoperative recovery interval."
CD009323,0,7638911,0,[Laparoscopic ultrasonography. A review and authors' own experiences].,"Laparoscopic ultrasound scanning has long been available, but interest in and reports of the technique have until the last few years been sporadic. The rapid development and growing interest in laparoscopic surgery as well as the advent of commercially available systems designed for laparoscopic ultrasound have resulted in renewed interest in the technique. The available published reports lack prospective, controlled clinical studies with respect to where and when laparoscopic ultrasound would be indicated. A favourable picture is given as concerns the use of laparoscopic ultrasound in the diagnosis and evaluation of primary liver and pancreas tumours as well as liver metastases. Laparoscopic ultrasound is also mentioned as a reliable alternative to cholangiography in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our own preliminary experiences with two laparoscopic ultrasound systems and a simple system using an ultrasound finger-probe are described. A laparoscopic ultrasound scanning system consisting of a stiff instrument with a convex (linear) transducer mounted on a flexible support and with the possibility of ultrasound-guided biopsy and colour-Doppler seems optimal. Prospective studies are being carried out to identify areas of utilization and limitations of laparoscopic ultrasound."
CD009323,0,21400431,0,Color Doppler application in laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasonography.,"During the past decade, several investigators reported effective application of intraoperative ultrasonography as a new diagnostic modality in surgery. Intraoperative ultrasonography has been successfully applied in the screening of the biliary tract and in the examination of the liver, pancreas, urinary tract, and endocrine organs. It has also been used successfully during vascular surgery. With the advent of minimal access surgery, the application of expensive preoperative diagnostic tests has visibly increased, particularly the use of ERCP procedures in patients with cholecystolithiasis. The loss of tactile feedback during laparoscopic surgery for gastrointestinal malignancy stimulated the increasing use of CT and MRI imaging. With our prior experience in intraoperative ultrasonography and in the advent of minimal access surgery, we were stimulated to introduce laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasonography (LIOU) in 1990 for screening the biliary tract for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. More reports on the use of laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasonography followed."

Surgical procedures were a pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) in 20 cases, a distal pancreatectomy in 4 cases, a palliative intervention in 61 cases, an exploratory laparotomy in 13 cases and a video laparoscopy in 2 cases. Adjuvant treatments were given in addition to resection in 20 patients. In the 20 patients undergoing PD, mortality was 20% and morbidity 20%. There was no mortality and no morbidity in distal pancreatectomy. The 1-year survival in pancreatoduodenectomy was 50% and 0% for distal pancreatectomy. Pancreatic resection, radical and palliative, whenever technically possible, represents the treatment of choice for pancreatic cancer."
CD009323,0,8581816,0,[Mirizzi syndrome: preoperative diagnosis and therapeutic management].,"The Mirizzi syndrome describes a benign obstruction of the common hepatic duct due to a stone impacted within the cystic duct or in the Hartman's pouch of the gall bladder. The obstruction is caused either by external compression (Type I) or due to arrosion of the common hepatic wall creating a cholecysto-biliary fistula (Type II-IV). In a period of 16 months we encountered this rare cause of obstructive jaundice four times. We discuss the importance of preoperative diagnosis and a safe surgical management. Ultrasonography together with the laboratory findings of obstructive jaundice may lead to the suspicion of a Mirizzi syndrome. Often the endoscopic retrograde cholangiography confirms the diagnosis. Some authors report the successful treatment of Mirizzi syndrome by laparoscopic surgery. Nevertheless, we propose the open procedure because of the presence of dense inflammatory adhesions at the junction between the gallbladder and the common hepatic duct. Biliary-enteric bypass is often required to establish a sufficient biliary drainage. We consider laparoscopic techniques to be too dangerous."
CD009323,0,8559003,0,[Nonparasitic liver cysts. Overview of therapy with long-term results].,"Symptomatic nonparasitic cysts of the liver require surgical intervention. Seventy-one patients were treated between 1977 and 1993 at the Department of General Surgery, University of Vienna. Different surgical treatments were compared with regard to complications and recurrence. Interventional puncture led to recurrences in nearly all cases and represents only a palliative procedure. Surgical treatment consisted of either laparoscopic (n = 7) or conventional (n = 44) fenestration or excision. The rates of recurrence did not differ significantly (14% vs 9%). The laparoscopic procedure is successful not only in polycystic disease but also in solitary cysts. Wide deroofing and excision were equally effective. Laparoscopic therapy should be tried in all cysts initially, because it causes less stress than celiotomy. Because of the small number of laparoscopically treated patients in the literature and in the authors' own experience, the significance of the difference in outcome between the two methods could not be established. In more patients, further investigations should be carried out to ascertain whether the laparoscopic method is superior regarding surgical stress and recurrence. Cystojejunostomy (n = 3) and hepatic resection (n = 2) are reserved for special indications. One homologous liver transplantation was successfully carried out 6 months after cystojejunostomy because of a cholangiocellular carcinoma. Frequent postoperative ascites represented a persistent problem in only one patient. Two of three cases of postoperative infection with intraabdominal abscesses led to death. Altogether, 16 patients died, including seven because of malignancy and three because of septic complications of a Potter III syndrome."
CD009323,0,8528972,0,Surgical therapy for gastric cancer.,"The aim of any surgical approach to gastric carcinoma should be a complete resection with no residual tumor left behind, that is, a R0-resection according to the UICC. Complete tumor resection in this respect refers to the primary tumor as well as the lymphatic drainage and requires an adequate safety margin. The indications for surgical therapy of gastric cancer and the choice of procedure should consequently be guided by the tumor stage. This requires accurate preoperative staging, which can today be achieved with endoscopic ultrasonography and surgical laparoscopy. Gastric carcinoma stage IA (mucosa carcinoma) can be cured by local excision. In patients with tumor stages IB (submucosa carcinoma), II, and IIIA, lymph node metastases are common. Based on the available data, this group of patients benefits from radical resection and D2 lymph node dissection. In patients with advanced gastric carcinoma, that is, tumor stages IIIB and IV, a complete tumor removal usually can not be achieved by surgical resection. Neoadjuvant therapeutic modalities should consequently be assessed in these patients. Based on tumor location and growth pattern, a total gastrectomy is the procedure of choice in patients with middle and proximal third gastric cancer. A subtotal gastrectomy may be performed in patients with tumors of the distal third and ""Laurén's intestinal type"" growth pattern. Depending on the individual tumor situation, the gastrectomy can be extended toward varying portions of the distal esophagus or a pancreas, preserving splenectomy and resection of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Laparoscopy has been advocated for this purpose. We reviewed the data of 12 patients and the literature to compare the results of laparoscopic staging to those of conventional imaging (ultrasonography-CT scan). Laparoscopy was more sensitive in the diagnosis of peritoneal and lives metastases. It was inadequate for the diagnosis of lymph node metastases. Laparoscopy was especially useful in patients with esophagus, stomach, pancreas and liver cancers. Laparoscopic ultrasonography improved the staging of pancreatic carcinoma and the diagnosis of liver metastases."

The pyloric tumor was immobilized by grasping the first portion of the duodenum and the anterior wall of the stomach, and electrocoagulation was used prior to incising the pyloric tumor to minimize bleeding during the procedure. Although this technique has been applied in only two patients so far, we present the details herein. We believe that with technical and instrumental refinements, the speed and safety of laparoscopic pyloromyotomy will improve and it will become an alternative to open surgery in pediatric patients."
CD009323,0,7879394,0,[Laparoscopic therapy of choledocholithiasis].,"In the period November 1991 to October 1993 altogether 418 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy in our unit. Routine intraoperative cholangiography, a prerequisite for diagnosing choledocholithiasis, was successful in 99.3% of cases. 38 patients were found to have common bile duct calculi and their management and follow up are reported in this study. In 36 cases stones were successfully eliminated by means of the laparoscopic procedure, via the cystic duct in 22 cases and by choledochotomy in 14 cases. One patient required postoperative endoscopic papillotomy, and in the remaining case surgical management was changed to classical laparotomy and open choledochotomy. Postoperative complications occurred in five cases. One patient suffering from bacterial peritonitis underwent laparotomy on the 9th postoperative day, another with postoperative bleeding from the cystic artery was relaparoscopied on the same day as the minimal invasive procedure. One patient developed a liver abscess three weeks after operation, requiring drainage with the aid of ultrasound. A superficial wound infection in one patient and biliary leakage after removal of the T-tube in another patient both healed spontaneously. Our results are similar to those obtained with other therapeutic concepts. Because the papilla of Vater remains intract in minimal invasive surgery, which causes relatively little stress to the patient, as well as considering the economic advantages of a single-step procedure, this management strategy can be recommended as a valuable alternative procedure."
CD009323,0,7830411,0,Management of biliary strictures due to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Injury to the extrahepatic bile ducts during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is a cause of serious long-term patient morbidity. In order to identify management strategies and outcome, we undertook a retrospective review and analysis of patients referred to the Department of Surgery and the Division of Gastroenterology for management of bile duct strictures due to injury at LC. Eighteen patients (15 women, 3 men) with a mean age of 41 years were identified over a 4-year period. Six patients had injuries identified at LC. Ten patients had previously undergone an attempt at operative repair (8 end-to-end anastomoses, 1 choledochoduodenostomy, 1 cystic duct jejunostomy). There were 5 Bismuth Grade I strictures, 6 Grade II, 2 Grade III and 5 Grade IV. Ten patients were managed nonoperatively with stents placed by radiologic or endoscopic techniques. Four patients were managed with operation alone (2 choledochojejunostomy, 1 hepaticojejunostomy, and 1 external T-tube drainage) and 4 patients with a combined endoscopic and operative approach (all 4 with hepaticojejunostomy after initial endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography management). Bile duct strictures due to LC are frequently located in the proximal bile ducts (Bismuth II-IV) and are technically difficult to repair. In the majority of cases, injuries are unrecognized at LC. Both immediate and delayed repair attempts prior to referral were frequently unsuccessful. Many bile duct strictures can be managed successfully in the early postoperative period with endoscopic and radiologic stenting techniques. Strictures which cannot be managed nonoperatively are repaired with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009323,0,7793830,0,[Pedicular traumas during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Apropos of 5 cases].,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now the procedure of choice for surgical removal of the gallbladder. Injury to the hepatic pedicle is the most significant complication of this procedure. Four cases of bile duct injury and one case of right hepatic artery injury were reviewed. Two complications arose from excessive use of cautery in the area of bile common duct and right hepatic artery, resulting in one case of biliary necrosis and one case of right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm. Two injuries were due to classical confusion between the common bile duct and the cystic duct. Another injury was due to partial ligation of the common by a clip on the cystic duct. Two patients required a Roux en Y hepaticojejunostomy, two patients had a common duct repair on a T tube and one patient required emergency ligation of the right hepatic artery and suture of the duodenum. We did not observe any mortality. Morbidity consisted of one case of spontaneously resolving duodenum leakage. In the light of these cases, after having discussed the therapeutic attitudes toward these lesions. The authors suggest practical tips to prevent hepatic pedicle injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,7774437,0,[Application of gasless laparoscopic device in laparoscopic surgery].,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the gasless laparoscopic device (GLD) in laparoscopic surgery. GLD, independently designed and manufactured by ourselves in 1993, incorporates a manipulator and laparoscopic abdominal retractor. From August to October 1993, we conducted an experimental study on gasless laparoscopic cholecysto-duodenostomy in 5 dogs. Four of them were completely successful and one was converted to open surgery due to gallbladder rupture. The result showed that GLD could maintain good exposure in laparoscopic surgery, laparoscopic suturing and knotting could become easier and operative cost could be reduced with conventional instruments. We also developed an intracorporeal ""Chinese Knotting"" and a self-designed push tube for extracorporeal knot tying. During April and August 1994, we successfully applied our modified GLD in gasless laparoscopic cholecystectomy, inguinal herniorrhaphy laparoscopic-assisted sigmoidectomy, abdomino-perineal resection of rectal carcinoma."
CD009323,0,7728345,0,Pancreatic and ampullary carcinoma.,"Surgery should be the first therapeutic modality considered in patients with pancreatic and ampullary carcinoma. Surgery is the only potentially curative therapy and offers the best form of palliation in patients with impending or overt duodenal obstruction. Patients with clearly unresectable tumors or those considered unfit for surgery should be offered palliative therapy, preferably endoscopically. The difficulty, however, arises in patients who undergo laparotomy and who subsequently are found to have unresectable tumors. The problem of stent occlusion and frequent associated hospital visits has been an argument to proceed to palliative double bypass surgery. Against this is the low mortality and shorter hospital stay of nonsurgical endoscopic palliative therapy. Direct comparisons of surgery versus endoscopic therapy have shown that both are equally effective in the initial relief of jaundice (Table 6). Surgery has a higher initial mortality and complication rate, but more long-term complications and hospital visits were seen in the endoscopic group, suggesting that it offered a poorer long-term palliation. There was no significant difference in the survival of the patients in the two groups. Patient choice is a major factor in the final decision, but current recommendations probably should be that patients with a poor short-term survival outlook should be offered nonsurgical palliative therapy and those with a longer life expectancy may best be handled with surgery. Predicting patient survival, of course, remains a major difficulty. A recent publication of the laparoscopic formation of a cholecystojejunostomy for palliation of malignant biliary obstruction also offers a promising approach that requires further evaluation."
CD009323,0,7725224,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with an ultrasound surgical aspirator.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy using an ultrasound surgical aspirator has been performed in our department since March 1991. The horn cover was altered in order to be inserted through a trocar 10 mm in diameter. The main purpose of this device is to explore Calot's triangle by fragmentation and aspiration of the fatty tissue without damaging the nerves, vessels, and cystic duct. First the serosa of the Calot's triangle is cut via electrocautery with the sharp-angle hook dissector we designed. Then the cystic duct and cystic artery are efficiently exposed by the ultrasound surgical aspirator. This procedure is perfectly adapted for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We obtained favorable results with the ultrasound surgical aspirator in 135 cases including 40 cases with a negative gallbladder, as evaluated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. In conclusion, the ultrasound surgical aspirator is suitable for skeletonizing the cystic duct and cystic artery, and the procedure is perfectly safe."
CD009323,0,7725218,0,Experience with laparoscopic double gallbladder removal.,"Double gallbladder is a rare congenital anomaly and an encounter with it while performing cholecystectomy laparoscopically is a challenge to the laparoscopic surgeon. A 28-year-old man complaining of epigastric pain was evaluated at Teikyo University Hospital, Mizonokuchi, Japan. There were no abnormal laboratory findings. Ultrasonography revealed an acoustic shadow in each compartment without any inflammatory changes in the gallbladder. No lesions were endoscopically noted in the stomach. CT scan could not demonstrate the anomaly. ERCP revealed a duplication of the gallbladder shadow with a stone in each vesicle and also the confluence of two cystic ducts from both the gallbladders draining into the common bile duct (CBD). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed successfully in this case. This paper presents this particular case because of double gallbladder's rarity in the literature and to emphasize the importance of preoperative cholangiographic evaluation for double gallbladder. The laparoscopic surgeon is given an idea of the meticulous dissection at the ""hepatocystic triangle"" due to the various other vascular and other congenital anomalies associated with it. An account of the classification of this congenital abnormality and its various types is also discussed here."
CD009323,0,7725210,0,"Complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Coordinated radiologic, endoscopic, and surgical treatment.","The diagnostic and therapeutic approaches used for patients referred for bile duct injuries and other major complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) were reviewed and the results of a coordinated radiologic, endoscopic, and surgical approach were assessed. From April 1991 to October 1993, 23 patients were observed. Seven patients had biliary strictures, five had biliary lesions, five presented with retained common bile duct (CBD) stones, and one had a minor cystic duct leak. Five patients had miscellaneous abdominal fluid collections; in addition, biloma or bile ascites were present in 10/23 cases. Correct definition of iatrogenic lesions was mainly made by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) (n = 15), associated in six cases also with percutaneous cholangiography (PTC). ""Minimally invasive"" treatment included the full range of endoscopic and interventional radiological procedures. Six patients with biliary strictures, one patient with a biliary lesion, all five patients with residual CBD stones, and four patients with abdominal collections were treated by ""minimally invasive"" techniques: Therefore, laparotomy was avoided in 70% of cases (16/23 patients). Open surgery was necessary in 7/23 patients (30%), because of ductal lesion (n = 4), ductal stricture by endoloop (n = 1), iliac artery injury (n = 1), and phlegmon of gallbladder bed (n = 1). It appears that careful assessment of complications after LC is mandatory and often requires the combined use of ERCP/PTC and cross-sectional imaging.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009323,0,7716317,0,[Laparoscopic ultrasonography in laparoscopic surgery and diagnosis].,"The authors report their experience with 101 patients examined with laparoscopic ultrasound (LU) using a dedicated 7.5-MHz linear probe which can be introduced through the 10-mm surgical trocars. In the patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (77 cases), LU adequately demonstrated gallbladder wall and contents in all cases and visualized the main bile duct in 93.5% of cases; stones of the CBD or cystic duct were demonstrated in two cases. The liver was studied in 18 patients undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy or laparoscopic colonic resection: secondary lesions were identified in two cases, while benign lesions (cysts or angiomas) were seen in 6 cases. In the patients operated on for colonic resection (8 cases), LU was successfully used to localize the enteric tract affected by the tumor and to mark safety margins for excision. The technical features of the exam are reported and the main imaging findings discussed. The authors conclude that LU is a safe method which is easy to perform and does not significantly increase the operating time; the indications of this laparoscopic application of ultrasound are not yet defined but the application area will certainly widen in the future, as operative and diagnostic laparoscopy are more and more frequently used by surgeons."

Separating adhesions at the terminal ileum laparoscopically a carcinoid tumour at Bauhin's valve was overlooked. Two weeks later the patient was resubmitted because of obstructive problems and the tumour was diagnosed at a conventional laparotomy. Basing on this case problems of laparoscopic treatment of bowel obstruction are discussed in general, and in special the decreased tactile abilities of the surgeon are mentioned."
CD009323,0,7636378,0,"Intestinal endometriosis: presentation, investigation, and surgical management.","The study was undertaken to identify the presenting features of intestinal endometriosis and to evaluate its investigation and surgical management. Twenty-six cases of intestinal endometriosis were identified during a fourteen year period. The commonest site of occurrence was the rectosigmoid region (11 cases) followed by the appendix (9 cases), and ileocaecal region (6 cases). Abdominal pain was the main presenting feature in 20 cases, with associated nausea and vomiting in 12 cases and altered bowel habit in ten. Other presenting features included rectal bleeding, abdominal bloating and tenesmus. Endometriosis was not suspected preoperatively in any of the patients without a past history of this condition. Accurate preoperative diagnosis proved very difficult, with only laparoscopy providing definite evidence of intestinal endometriosis prior to formal surgery. Colonic resections were performed in 12 cases, small bowel resection in six cases and appendicectomy in nine cases, together with resection of adjacent adherent structures. This series illustrates the difficulty of establishing an accurate preoperative diagnosis, and the propensity of intestinal endometriosis to mimic other gastrointestinal diseases, particularly carcinoma and inflammatory bowel disease."
CD009323,0,7617249,0,[Celioscopic treatment of choledocholithiasis: strategic problems. A clinical case].,"The authors report a case of suspected calculosis of the common bile duct (CBD) associated with cholecystolithiasis, both of which were treated using a coelioscopic approach. Using a flexible Olympus 5 mm urethroscope and Schuller-type urethral dilator sound, it was possible to explore the choledochus visually using a transcystic route prior to dilating the latter gradually and attempting to extract calculi using Dormia's probe. In selected cases of calculosis of the common bile duct, with a dilated cystic duct, it is possible to explore the choledochus using a transcystic route but it is not yet possible to extract stones at the same time. If, on the other hand, the choledochus is further dilated, it is preferable and more satisfactory to perform a choledochotomy using a coelioscopic route. In the light of coelioscopic progress and its diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities, the authors report their criteria for suspected lithiasis of the common bile duct and attribute a precise and important role to echo-endoscopy since its results lead to a different therapeutic strategy."
CD009323,0,7610730,0,[Experimental approach to left laparoscopic pancreas resection preserving the spleen].,"The pancreas has been excluded from laparoscopic surgery ever since. The technical possibilities of laparoscopic left resection of the pancreas in pigs are examined in this study. Mobilization of the left pancreatic segment up to the confluence area (splenic vein and upper mesenteric vein) was possible preserving the spleen. Sectioning of the organ was performed by ultrasound dissector and selective clipping of the pancreatic duct in 4 animals, in 2 animals this was achieved by Endo-GIA. The size of resected segments was 10-15 cm in length, 2-4 cm in width and the segments weighed 30 gr. Laparoscopic left resection of the pancreas with preservation of the spleen is technically possible in pigs. Postoperative complications have to be further examined in survival studies."
CD009323,0,7610722,0,[Complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,We report on complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy which needed surgical intervention. These complications occurred in 10 out of 250 patients operated at our hospital and 2 patients admitted with complications. In 3 cases the common bile duct was cut and a hepaticojejunostomy was carried out. 3 patients with an insufficiency of the cystic duct were treated by laparotomy. In 2 cases common bile duct stones had to be endoscopically removed. 1 patient suffered from a pneumothorax due to damage of the diaphragm. The tear was laparoscopically sewn. In one case the abdominal aorta had to be oversewn because of its damage by the needle during creation of the pneumoperitoneum. One patient with adhesions suffered from a perforation of the gut as the trocar was introduced. 2 patients developed an umbilical hernia and underwent surgical herniotomy. In spite of all advantages minimal access surgery of the gallbladder seems to be affected with more serious complications than open approach.
CD009323,0,7551261,0,Management of pancreatic carcinoma.,"Pancreatic cancer is the fifth-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. It is estimated that 27,000 patients die each year with this diagnosis. The overall five-year survival of patients with pancreatic cancer remains less than 5%, but some subsets of patients may have a better prognosis. Advanced imaging and laparoscopy have improved staging to better select patients for potentially curative surgery, while the operative morbidity and mortality of the Whipple resection have decreased in recent years. Non-surgical therapies in current use include chemotherapy, external-beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy, as well as pain management. More recently, gene insertion therapy has shown promise in animal models. This review discusses current diagnostic and treatment strategies for these patients and documents the need for new strategies in the future."
CD009323,0,7541927,1,[Laparoscopic staging of gastrointestinal tumors].,"Laparoscopic staging was carried out in 28 cases with carcinomas of the distal esophagus, cardia, stomach or pancreas. The intention was first to rule out peritoneal carcinomatosis and secondly to see, whether RO-resection would be possible, mainly for the reason of therapeutic splitting. The diagnostic accuracy can be raised to 95% using laparoscopic ultrasound, exploration of the lesser sac of the peritoneum and tissue sampling in combination with preoperative endoscopy and radiography. In 39.3% of the investigated patients the staging must be corrected after laparoscopic staging compared with the preoperative findings. 35.7% of the patients did not need explorative laparotomy."
CD009323,0,7977996,0,Cystic duct leaks in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Cystic duct leak (CDL) appears to complicate laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) more often than open cholecystectomy (OC). No mention of CDL was found in a literature review that covered 48,822 OCs and their complications."
CD009323,0,7881145,0,Balloon dilatation of the sphincter of Oddi facilitates passage of glass beads from the canine biliary tract.,"Laparoscopic management of common duct stones is increasing. The most widely used technique involves trans-cystic duct scope placement and stone extraction. Occasionally, stones cannot be retrieved and are allowed to pass spontaneously after manipulation of the sphincter of Oddi. This study examines a model of sphincter of Oddi dilatation in the dog to facilitate passage of glass beads simulating gallstones. In 24 dogs, glass beads of varying sizes (3-8 mm) were implanted in the gallbladder and allowed to pass spontaneously over 1 month. In three separate groups, these animals underwent (1) sham instrumentation of the sphincter of Oddi (control), (2) sphincter dilatation with balloon catheters, or (3) transduodenal sphincterotomy. At the end of 1 month, all the animals were autopsied, and the glass beads were retrieved. Histologic sections of the pancreas were examined for possible pancreatitis. The results of this study show that no animal experienced pancreatitis from sphincter manipulation or the passage of glass beads. The control animals who underwent sham manipulation of the sphincter passed 10% of their glass beads. In contrast, after sphincter dilatation, 52.5% of the 3-mm glass beads passed or 22% of all size beads. Animals with sphincterotomy passed a similar amount of glass beads as those with balloon dilatation. These studies suggest that balloon dilatation is as efficacious as sphincterotomy in facilitating the passage of glass beads from the canine biliary tract."
CD009323,0,7878517,0,A new 3-D laparoscope in gastrointestinal surgery.,"This study was set up to compare three-dimensional imaging of a new three-dimensional laparoscope with two-dimensional imaging in the inanimate and clinical settings. In the clinical setting the laparoscope was used in a total of 50 different laparoscopic operations. It provided excellent depth perception, definition, and resolution. The relationships of structures were more easily defined, and instrument manipulation was easier, doing away with the need for ""touch and feel"" to determine instrument position. Three-D imaging made cannulation of the cystic duct for cholangiography or with a flexible choledochoscope easier. In the inanimate setting basic simple tasks took the same time in 2-D as in 3-D, whereas a more complicated procedure of passing a needle and suture through a series of hoops was 25% faster when performed in 3-D compared to 2-D. Three-D imaging may reduce operative time for laparoscopic procedures, particularly the more complicated operations."
CD009323,0,7878516,0,Technique and results of routine dynamic cholangiography during 528 consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies.,"With the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy a trend toward more extensive preoperative diagnostic study of the biliary tree by intravenous cholangiography or ERCP has been observed. However, both exams have technical limitations and are not without risk. We report our experience with 500 consecutive routine dynamic intraoperative cholangiographies during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 97% of which were successful. No lesions from cholangiography were observed. In ten patients clips on the cystic artery appeared on intraoperative cholangiogram to be too close to the hepatic duct and were removed. Anomalies of surgical importance were discovered in 11 patients (2.3%). Unsuspected stones were found in 18 cases (3.7%) and suspected stones confirmed in 12 (2.4%). In our experience routine dynamic intraoperative cholangiography provided important information in 51 cases out of 500 (10.2%). We conclude that routine dynamic intraoperative cholangiography is extremely useful for safer laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cost containment."
CD009323,0,7878505,0,Laparoscopic management of choledocholithiasis.,"The authors report on a group of 114 patients with common bile duct (CBD) stones who were treated by laparoscopic surgery. Management through the cystic duct was considered the first option. Choledochotomy was used for those patients in which the cystic approach was not possible or was unsuccessful. Transcystic lithotripsy was considered for patients with CBD stones in disproportion with the size of the cystic duct. Laparoscopic antegrade sphincterotomy was indicated as a drainage procedure. The transcystic approach was used in 89.5% of the patients; choledochotomy was used in 6.2%; and both ways were used in 4.3%. Different procedures were used, including mechanical and electrohydraulic lithotripsy, choledochotomy with T-tube or endoprostheses drainage, laparoscopic sphincterotomy, end-to-end common bile duct anastomosis, and choledochoduodenum anastomosis. One of the patients was in the 21st week of pregnancy. The laparoscopic approach to choledocholithiasis was successfully performed in 94.8% of the patients. Mean hospital stay was 1.7 days. There was a 6.2% incidence of complications and the mortality rate was 0.9%. In 84.3% of the patients, the transcystic approach was used successfully, with a complication rate of 4.9% and a mean hospital stay of 1.6 days. Three patients were converted to open surgery early in this series. Thus far, one patients has presented residual CBD stones. The results obtained suggest that laparoscopic common bile duct exploration is a technically feasible procedure, with low complication and mortality rates, although it requires adequate selection of patients and a variety of techniques and types of equipment."
CD009323,0,7878503,0,Laparoscopic trans-cystic-duct common-bile-duct exploration.,"One thousand seventy-one consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed. Routine cholangiography was employed with a 99% success rate. One hundred thirty patients were found to have common duct stones (CBDS). In 48 (37%) patients they were unsuspected. One hundred eleven patients underwent attempted trans-cystic-duct extraction techniques (TCD-CBDE). One hundred three (93%) were successful. The following techniques were employed: 101--biliary endoscopy, 23--ampullary balloon dilation, 2--fluoroscopic basket retrieval. The average operative time was 136 min. The average postsurgical stay was 3.7 days. There were 19 (17%) complications--6 (5%) major. There were 4 retained stones (2 intentional) and 1 death. Patients over 65 years of age had more complications and patients with unsuspected CBDS under 65 years of age had the fewest. TCD-CBDE is a safe, effective way to extract common duct calculi. Endoscopy and basket stone retrieval was the primary technique employed."
CD009323,0,7875975,0,[Laparoscopic Y-Roux anastomosis].,"In order to circumvent laparotomy in patients with biliary obstruction due to inoperable carcinoma of the pancreatic head, we evaluated the feasibility of a bypass operation using minimal invasive measures. A technique of laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy was developed in adult pigs with a previous clip occlusion of the distal common bile duct to imitate choledochal obstruction. Complete biliary bypass was restored with a cholecystojejunostomy via a Roux-en-Y loop using two circular staplers (21, 25 or 29 mm diameter), introduced through a 33-mm-diameter trocar, to perform the proximal and distal anastomoses. 12 pigs operated in this way, recovered easily with normal weight gain and without technical complications. Contrast radiography of the biliary bypass at autopsy on day 28 demonstrated patent and leak-free anastomoses and functional bypass. We conclude that laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy with Roux-en-Y loop is a feasible technique resulting in an uncomplicated postoperative course and a biliary bypass with optimal function. Endoscopic application of circular staplers to perform laparoscopic entero-biliary and entero-enteral anastomosis is practical and safe."
CD009323,0,7866612,0,Laparoscopic repair of cholecystoduodenal fistulae.,"Since the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1987 by Mouret, the scope of biliary surgery available to a laparoscopic surgeon has increased. In the early days of the procedure there were several accepted contraindications. Some of these were acute cholecystitis, morbid obesity, adherent gallbladder, jaundiced patients, ductal calculi, and biliary tract anomalies. In a series of 300 laparoscopic cholecystectomies we encountered five cholecystoduodenal fistulae. It was possible to deal with four fistulae laparoscopically. Two patients underwent a laparotomy, one for a failed laparoscopic repair of cholecystoduodenal fistula and the other for several common bile duct (CBD) stones, which could not be removed laparoscopically via the cystic duct. We maintain that with increasing expertise and improved instrumentation, most cases of cholecystoduodenal fistula could be dealt with laparoscopically."
CD009323,0,7866610,0,Common bile duct exploration: the place of laparoscopic choledochotomy.,"Since laparoscopic cholecystectomy was introduced, the treatment of choledocholithiasis has been modified. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been performed selectively in elderly patients and in those with a strong suspicion of biliary duct stones (jaundice, demonstrated at ultrasound). Intraoperative discovery of common duct stones at cystic duct cholangiography signifies that they must be removed intraoperatively [or postoperatively by ERPC and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES)]. As ES has a failure rate of 3-23%, laparoscopic common duct exploration emerges as the treatment of choice. Since November 1990, we have performed 59 laparoscopic common bile duct explorations. In our experience, the transcystic technique (18 patients) with choledochoscopy appears easier to perform than with fluoroscopy without choledochoscopy. Since, during our early experience, we encountered some difficulty with the transcystic technique, we elected to evaluate common duct exploration through a choledochotomy (41 patients). The main advantage of this technique is that it provides complete access to the ductal system without damage to the papilla. This procedure seems more difficult to perform than the transcystic technique and can be used when there are contraindications to the latter."
CD009323,0,7530358,0,[Celioscopy in digestive oncology].,"In patients with suspected or patent cancer involving digestive tract organs, laparoscopy can be successfully used both as a diagnostic tool for initial diagnosis or evaluation of cancer extension and as a therapeutic tool, either in successive or in a single operation. For diagnosis, the main aim of laparoscopy is to confirm the clinical diagnosis or search for neoplastic diffusion. Diagnostic laparoscopy is particularly important in cases of advanced cancer when extension may render laparotomy unjustifiable. Needle biopsies of the liver can be obtained under visual control and non-resectable tumours can be identified. For cancer of the pancreas laparoscopic findings are highly specific, reaching 100% in cases with peritoneal carcinoma. Laparoscopy has similar advantages for staging cancer of the gall bladder which is often discovered after extension to other organs. There are few indications for cancer of the digestive tract itself although laparotomy would be more sensitive than echography or computed tomography for recognizing hepatic or peritoneal metastasis. Palliative treatment via laparoscopy is just at its beginnings and will require continued development in techniques and material. Currently, palliative hyperthermia for peritoneal carcinoma is under clinical evaluation. The future role of curative laparoscopy for abdominal cancers must be evaluated on the basis of prospective protocols."
CD009323,0,7974955,0,Laparoscopic treatment of small-bowel obstruction following laparoscopic lymphadenectomy.,Laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection followed by radical perineal prostatectomy has become the treatment of choice for selected patients at our institution with clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate. We describe 2 cases in which bowel obstruction caused by incarceration of a loop of small bowel into a trocar site was managed with laparoscopic techniques.
CD009323,0,7855474,0,Laparoscopy for construction of feeding enteral tubes and diverting stomas.,Laparoscopy has now assumed a new and important role in the treatment of malignant diseases. An important part of this role is the establishment of feeding enterostomies and stomas. This function is vital in both those patients who may not be candidates for curative therapy and those being staged for definitive therapy.
CD009323,0,7855473,0,Apneumic laparoscopy in surgical oncology.,"Minimally invasive techniques now play an important role in virtually every aspect of general surgery. While it is unlikely that celiotomy for malignant disease will fall into obscurity as rapidly as open cholecystectomy, greater use of videoscopic techniques in surgical oncology are inevitable and will undoubtably improve patient care. Techniques of isopneumic laparoscopy have already proven useful in trauma, cholecystectomy, bowel resection, herniorrhaphy, and a variety of other procedures. Further advances in this technique are dependent on the development of ""user friendly"" abdominal wall retraction systems."
CD009323,0,7846916,0,Selective use of ERCP in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"With the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCH) various strategies have been proposed for the management of common bile duct (CBD) stones. In a consecutive series of 1140 patients subjected to LCH, preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was attempted in 128 patients (11.2%) and successfully accomplished in 121 (94.5%). Based on the prediction of CBD stones by laboratory tests, ultrasonography, and intravenous cholangiography, prelaparoscopic ERCP was performed in 106 patients (9.3%). CBD stones were identified in 56 patients and benign papillary stenosis in 5 patients (57.5%). Of these 61 patients, 58 (95%) were treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) and stone extraction followed by LCH after a mean interval of 1.6 days. Three patients with failure of endoscopic ductal stone extraction required open CBD exploration. In 39 of the 106 patients (36.8%) ERCP was negative for ductal stones but revealed unexpected ampullary and pancreatic cancer in two cases. Six patients (of the 106) with preoperative ERCP cannulation failure (5.7%) were managed either by LCH and intraoperative cholangiography or by open CBD exploration. In 22 of the 1140 total patients (1.9%) ERCP was performed at various intervals after LCH. Retained CBD stones were found in eight patients, and ES and ductal clearance was achieved in all eight. There was no mortality among the entire surgical group who underwent perioperative ERCP/ES. Including two cases of ES-related pancreatitis, the overall morbidity was 5.5% (7 of 128). Perioperative ERCP/ES in conjunction with LCH is an attractive approach for patients with cholecystocholedocholithiasis, at least until laparoscopic ductal clearance becomes a standard procedure."
CD009323,0,7831611,0,Laparoscopy preferable to imaging procedures in detecting metastases of a pancreas carcinoma to the liver. Report of two cases.,"In two patients a pancreatic mass, 6 and 4 cm in diameter, respectively, was detected using imaging techniques. Computed tomography, ultrasound, and angiography revealed no evidence of a metastatic lesion in the liver. In the first patient, exploration was done prior to a possible radical operation. Multiple hepatic metastases forming thin, flat lesions on the surface of the liver were present and palliative surgery only was done. In the other patient, laparoscopy was done before surgical exploration and multiple hepatic metastases on the surface of the liver were clearly evident. Laparoscopy can help to avoid unnecessary explorations in patients with large pancreas cancer."
CD009323,0,7827896,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis.,"The safety and efficacy of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis were evaluated in a 2-year retrospective review. Results of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 66 patients with acute inflammation of the gallbladder were compared with those of the standard open procedure for this condition (43 patients) and routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy (227 patients). The laparoscopic procedure for acute cholecystitis was successful in 46 of 66 patients. There was no difference in mean operating time when the inflamed gallbladder was removed laparoscopically or at open surgery (82 versus 84 min); however, each procedure took longer than did routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy (mean 69 min; P < 0.01). There was no difference in analgesic requirement between patients who underwent laparoscopic removal of an acutely inflamed gallbladder and those in the other two groups. Postoperative recovery was significantly faster than that after open surgery (P < 0.01), but took longer than that following routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy (P < 0.01). Inability to identify the cystic duct was the most common reason for conversion to open operation, which occurred in 20 cases of acute cholecystitis. Bile duct injury occurred in one of 66 patients with acute cholecystitis treated laparoscopically, two of 227 cases of routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy but in no patient who underwent open cholecystectomy. In conclusion, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is technically achievable in the majority of patients with acute cholecystitis. The conversion rate is high but, if the procedure is completed successfully, postoperative recovery is more rapid than that after open surgery. However, the method carries a higher incidence of complications and should be attempted only by experienced surgeons."

CD009323,0,7715127,0,[Immediate results of surgical treatment of pancreatoduodenal cancer].,"The significance of two-stage treatment of obstructive jaundice caused by tumors of the terminal part of the biliary tract is shown on rich clinical material. The performance, in the first stage, of I.D. Prudkov's laparoscopic cholecystostomy which causes little trauma improved the accuracy of topical diagnosis to 95%. Its simple techniques and reliability made it accessible to a wide circle of surgeons. Preliminary decompression of the biliary tract increased operability to 14.9% and reduced postoperative mortality to 8.9%. In cases in which a radical operation was not possible, the risk of a palliative intervention diminished and postoperative mortality reduced to 3.1%."
CD009323,0,7712994,0,The role of endoscopic ultrasonography in biliary tract disease: obstructive jaundice.,"Forty-one patients (22 females, 19 males, mean age 74 years, range 41-93) with extrahepatic obstructive jaundice were evaluated by transcutaneous sonography (US), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) within 24 hours of hospital admission. EUS was always performed after US and immediately prior to ERCP, the latter being considered the ""gold standard"" for this study. EUS findings were documented according to a pre-set data protocol in a blind fashion with respect to ERCP results. Common bile duct (CBD) dilatation was demonstrated by all three methods. Stones in the distal CBD causing obstruction were demonstrated by EUS in 15 out of 16 patients, but in only seven cases by US. In 25 patients, the underlying malignant disease was identified by EUS as well as ERCP, and the level of biliary obstruction was correctly determined by both methods, while with US this was possible only in 17 (89%) and 20 (80%) cases, respectively. In comparison with ERCP, EUS provided a direct image of the tumor and allowed for regional staging in all patients. EUS was superior to US in elucidating the cause of biliary obstruction. EUS provides an additional means to decide quickly on appropriate therapy. At present, a shortcoming of the method is that no therapeutic interventions can be performed during EUS examination."
CD009323,0,7712968,0,Endoscopic treatment of biliary leakage after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is an effective and safe treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis. However, biliary tract injury may be more common with this procedure than with open cholecystectomy. We have encountered 17 patients with a biliary leak among 465 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the diagnosis being established by clinical and radiographic parameters. The most common site of leakage was the cystic duct stump. Patients underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement, with an overall success rate of 96%. No morbidity or mortality related to the endoscopic procedures was encountered. We conclude that biliary leakage after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is uncommon. When it occurs, it can be treated safely and efficaciously by endoscopic means."

CD009323,0,7959261,0,Pelvic adhesion formation after pelvic lymphadenectomy: comparison between transperitoneal laparoscopy and extraperitoneal laparotomy in a porcine model.,"Compared to extraperitoneal laparotomy, the transperitoneal approach is associated with increased enteric morbidity. Recently, transperitoneal laparoscopy has been employed as a method to surgically stage patients with gynecologic malignancies. The objective of this study was to investigate pelvic adhesion formation in a porcine model after pelvic lymphadenectomy performed via transperitoneal laparoscopy (LS) compared to extraperitoneal laparotomy (EP). Ten adult, female hogs underwent LS and 10 underwent EP. A complete pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in each animal. Three weeks after the lymphadenectomy, the animals underwent exploratory laparotomy, and the adhesions were quantified. Nineteen animals were evaluable. The adhesion scores for the laparoscopy group (N = 10, mean = 0.075 +/- 0.17) were not statistically different from those of the laparotomy group (N = 9, mean = 0.28 +/- 0.52, P > 0.5). Eight of 10 (80%) and 5 of 9 (56%) animals in the LS and EP groups, respectively, had no adhesions after pelvic lymphadenectomy. Adhesion formation is one of many critical issues concerning the utility of pretreatment surgical staging, especially for cancer of the cervix. It is remarkable that only 20% of the animals undergoing laparoscopy in this study had de novo adhesions after pelvic lymph node dissection and that the mean total adhesion score was not statistically different from the extraperitoneal laparotomy. Therefore, transperitoneal laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy may not induce the degree of adhesion formation associated with the transperitoneal laparotomy technique."
CD009323,0,7859681,0,Laparoscopic transcystic papillotomy under endoscopic control for bile duct stones.,We present here a laparoscopic transcystic papillotomy technique for the management of bile duct stones discovered either preoperatively or on intraoperative cholangiogram. Papillotomy is performed orthogradely with a hydrophilic wire-guided spincterotome inserted through the cystic duct. The correct position of the diathermic wire is verified with peroral duodenoscopy. The method has proved save and effective in our first 12 consecutive patients. Further evaluation is required to clarify its potential role in laparoscopic biliary surgery.
CD009323,0,7833511,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a freestanding outpatient surgery center.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a freestanding outpatient surgery center was evaluated. Fifty-five patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy during a 10-month period from December 1992 to October 1993 were included in this study. There were 10 males and 45 females, with a mean age of 42 years. All patients had a history consistent with biliary colic. Forty-nine patients had documentation of cholelithiasis by ultrasonography, 3 had documentation of cholelithiasis by other diagnostic procedures, and 3 had a diagnosis of biliary dyskinesia. The mean surgery time was 75 min, with a range of 43-145 min. Fifty-four intraoperative cholangiography attempts were made, and 81% were successful. In 19%, intraoperative cholangiography was unsuccessful secondary to a small cystic duct. Fifty of the patients (90%) in this study were discharged from the surgery center without significant sequelae. Four patients were admitted to the hospital postoperatively, 1 for bradycardia, 1 for nausea, 1 for i.v. antibiotics secondary to purulent cholecystitis, and 1 for inability to maintain an adequate oxygen saturation. Another patient was admitted 1 week postoperatively for right upper quadrant pain. After a negative hepatobiliary scan, this patient was discharged without sequelae. The average facility charge of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in this series was $2300, compared with the average charge of $6500 in our community hospital. We conclude that laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely and cost effectively in a freestanding outpatient surgery center with proper patient selection."
CD009323,0,7809814,0,Metastatic implantation of an oral squamous-cell carcinoma at a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy site.,"Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has become an important adjunct in the care of the head-and-neck cancer patient. When resection will likely affect swallowing, PEG can be performed just prior to cancer resection. However, it is unclear whether PEG should be the procedure of choice for establishing enteral access in head-and-neck cancer patients. In this report we describe a man with advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma who had a One-Step PEG button inserted immediately prior to his cancer resection. Six months later, the patient developed metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma at the PEG site. Although the mechanism of spread cannot be confirmed, direct seeding from passage through the cancer-filled oral cavity seems likely. Methods of establishing enteral access which avoid tumor-contaminated fields, such as use of an overtube during conventional PEG, open gastrostomy, or laparoscopic gastrostomy, may be more appropriate in head-and-neck cancer patients."

The related standard radiologic procedures are preoperative ultrasonography (US) and preoperative cholangiography (PCA). In a retrospective study of 214 patients scheduled for LC over a 2-year period we have reviewed the radiologic and clinical records. Preoperative US revealed stones in the common bile duct (CBD) in 8 patients, all treated with endoscopic papillotomy before or after operation. PCA was successful in 176 patients (82%) and gave crucial information in 22 patients including 8 with stones in the CBD not preoperatively diagnosed, 6 with anomalous anatomy, and 8 with malpositioned surgical clip on the cystic duct. In 26 patients LC was converted into open surgery, but in only one case due to CBD stone revealed at PCA. Seventeen patients had minor postoperative complications, all managed conservatively. We consider preoperative US and PCA appropriate radiologic investigations in conjunction with LC."

The patient is a 27-year-old man who presented to our hospital with a 6-week history of recurrent right-upper-quadrant pain with abdominal ultrasound findings compatible with hydatid cyst of the liver. The cyst was approached laparoscopically using the same hydatid asepsis as in open surgery. The cyst was evacuated laparoscopically and marsupialized, and its remaining cavity was packed with omentum. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged home on the third postoperative day. He had minimal biliary leak that ceased spontaneously on the fifth postoperative day."
CD009323,0,7986601,0,[Adult patients with clinically suspected or known biliopancreatic pathology in whom ERCP is not indicated: the 10 most frequent situations].,"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is an invasive endoscopic technique widely used in the diagnosis and eventual therapeutic procedures of many biliopancreatic conditions. While endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography indications are well known, it is not the same in those patients with clinically suspected or known biliopancreatic entities in whom endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography is not indicated because it will not add valuable information with the potential of changing the previous diagnosis or therapy. Ten very common clinical situations in which this technique is not indicated are presented; among them idiopathic abdominal pain, some pancreatic carcinomas, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst, and some patients awaiting conventional or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We acknowledge that some aspects of this paper are controversial."
CD009323,0,7979071,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: potential for missed pathology.,"The performance of a general exploratory laparotomy immediately after opening the abdominal cavity has long been a foundation of surgical practice. Since the introduction of laparoscopy, this procedure has been modified. This may result in certain intra-abdominal pathologies being overlooked, especially in areas that are hard to observe with the laparoscope. In this paper we describe two patients who presented with carcinomas after uneventful laparoscopic procedures, one of the lower oesophagus and the other of the pancreas. This raises questions about the extent of preoperative investigation before the performance of laparoscopic procedures."
CD009323,0,7938729,0,[Intraoperative digital cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy interventions].,"In the last years, laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the method of choice in the surgical treatment of gallbladder stones. Recently, the same laparoscopic approach has been used to remove choledochus stones. This surgical procedure needs the accurate intraoperative study of the biliary tree with diagnostic imaging modalities to better define the anatomy of the biliary ducts and the possible presence of choledochus stones. To this purpose, transcutaneous and endolaparoscopic US with dedicated probes and intraoperative cholangiography can be performed. In this study, we performed 30 laparoscopic cholecystectomies during which all the patients were submitted to intraoperative cholangiography with a digital fluoroscopic unit. The maneuvers for catheter insertion in the cystic duct and the examination as a whole took 3 to 5 minutes. Intraoperative cholangiography demonstrated choledochus stones in 3 patients, while preoperative US detected them in 2 patients only. In 8 cases the dynamic study, carried out with digital image acquisition, allowed to refer the biliary duct filling defects to artifacts caused by the presence of air bubbles. In conclusion, intraoperative cholangiography, also during endolaparoscopic cholecystectomy, plays a major role in the surgical assessment of the biliary tree. When the procedure was performed with a digital fluoroscopic unit, its diagnostic accuracy was higher and the images on the TV monitor were better visualized."
CD009323,0,7632108,0,[To avoid complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now becoming a safe procedure for the benign cholecystic diseases. But the differences, for example in the method of access to peritoneal cavity, visual field, and tools, between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery results in different complications. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how to avoid complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A hundred consecutive patients were expected to receive an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy from April 1991 to November 1992 in our clinic. Two patients were converted to open cholecystectomy. The reasons for conversion were uncontrollable bleeding from cystic artery and common-bile duct injury. Two other patients were obliged to undergo laparotomy due to post-operative bile leakage. Arterial bleeding from abdominal wall caused by inserting trocar was experienced in one case. Improvement of the equipment and surgical technique have got rid of these complications. We think it is still necessary to do intra-operative examinations such as cholangiography or ultrasonography. The previous two cases with complication of biliary injury underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy without intraoperative examinations. We could have avoided these complications if intraoperative examinations were used. To prevent the complication of bleeding from abdominal wall, we have been carrying out a unique method. After the introduction of these procedures, we have never experienced any of these complications."
CD009323,0,7992414,1,[Preoperative laparoscopic evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer].,"Nineteen consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach or pancreas, in whom preoperative ultrasonography and computed tomography were unable to assess the possibility of surgical resection, had a diagnostic laparoscopy performed. In 16 cases the operability could be established from the findings at laparoscopy. All laparoscopies were carried out without major morbidity and with a short postoperative hospital stay. It is concluded that patients belonging to this category should have a diagnostic laparoscopy performed in order to avoid futile laparotomies, which in cases that are unsuitable for surgical treatment are associated with emotional stress, physical morbidity and a prolonged hospital stay."
CD009323,0,9073734,0,Management of Selected Adnexal Masses in Postmenopausal Women by Operative Laparoscopy-A Multicentered Study.,"With careful preoperative assessment we have selected postmenopausal women who were believed to have benign adnexal masses and who were candidates for removal of these masses via operative laparoscopy. Criteria for inclusion were: postmenopausal status; cystic adnexal mass less than 10 cm. with distinct borders and without irregular solid parts or thick septa; CA 125<35 U/ml; and no contraindications for surgery. Sixty-one women were entered into the study. All of the masses were benign, including 27 serous cysts, 15 serous cystadenomas, 1 mucinous cystadenoma, 5 serous cystadenofibromas, 6 paratubal cysts, 3 retroperitoneal cysts, and 4 chronic hydrosalpinges. Fifty-eight patients had successful pelviscopic removal of their adnexal mass. Three patients (5%) required laparotomy. For patients managed by operative laparoscopy, mean operating time was 63 minutes, mean postoperative stay was 12 hours, and mean time to return to normal activity was 5.6 days. We conclude that the combination of CA 125 values and pelvic ultrasound can successfully predict benign masses in postmenopausal women, and removal of these masses by operative laparoscopy is acceptable in carefully selected women."
CD009323,0,8047952,0,Laparoscopic cholangiography. The case for a selective approach.,"Intraoperative cholangiography has proved to be a significant benefit for the biliary surgeon by alleviating the morbidity of unnecessary common duct exploration in patients with suspected but unproved choledocholithiasis and by clarifying biliary anatomy in patients when dissection proves difficult. Laparoscopic surgeons should be capable of performing the procedure when indicated and should be comfortable interpreting the images obtained. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with selective application of cholangiography can be performed with little or no effect on the incidence of retained calculi, with no impact on the incidence of common bile duct injury, and with diminished operative time and expense. The experienced laparoscopic surgeon can become facile with the procedure quickly and easily and does not require routine performance of the study to maintain these skills. Reduction of the incidence of biliary injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be achieved by early meticulous dissection at the infundibular-cystic duct junction, with limited use of laser or electrocautery in this region rather than by reliance on intraoperative cholangiography."
CD009323,0,8047947,0,Endoscopic techniques in management of biliary tract injuries.,"What can be said with certainty regarding endotherapy for biliary injuries associated with laparoscopic or conventional cholecystectomy? On the one hand, ongoing cystic duct and most bile duct leaks close rapidly after sphincterotomy or placement of a stent or both. Such therapy does not preclude the need for drainage of sizable bilomas. On the other hand, acute and ultimate success of endotherapy appears to be contingent on the degree and perhaps the cause of injury. Although ERCP is useful in diagnosing transection or an inadvertently stapled right hepatic duct, treatment of these conditions remains in the surgical realm. Nor is it likely, in my opinion, that a duct that has been stapled across 75% of its diameter or one with an extremely long stenosis, suggesting devascularization and ischemic injury, will respond to either a radiologic or endoscopic approach. In this setting, ERCP may be used diagnostically, or therapy may be undertaken in an attempt to convert an urgent surgical intervention into an elective and controlled one. Endotherapy appears to be useful, however, for a considerable subset of patients with inadvertent thermal or incisional injury, although need for periodic dilation therapy and exchange of the stent remain limiting factors. Moreover, even in patients with apparent short-term or intermediate-term success, caution is urged to continue periodic clinical and liver function test surveillance because recurrent stenosis may occasionally be subtle and present not as jaundice or cholangitis but as secondary biliary cirrhosis with its attendant consequences."
CD009323,0,8047946,0,Interventional radiology in the management of bile duct injuries.,"The advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has brought an increased number of bile duct injuries to the attention of surgeons and interventional radiologists. The spectrum of injury ranges from cystic duct stump leakage to partial obstruction to complete occlusion of the ducts and common hepatic or common bile duct ischemic strictures. The proper therapy for any given patient may be surgical or nonsurgical. Frequently, interventional radiologic techniques permit successful nonoperative drainage of postoperative fluid collections and percutaneous management of bile duct injury and stricture. In some patients in whom radiologic techniques are not successful or in whom the extent of injury requires surgical repair, interventional radiologic techniques can provide preoperative anatomic definition of the extent of injury as well as catheter localization of intrahepatic duct strictures before proximal hepaticojejunostomy."

CD009323,0,7992168,0,An alternative technique for laparoscopic cholangiography.,"The current methods utilized for laparoscopic cholangiography involve cystic duct cannulation and present practical difficulties and potential hazards. An alternative method for intraoperative cholangiography is described which is easy, quick, and safe. The Kumar clamp (a gift from Sabi Kumar, M.D.) is placed across the infundibulum. A 23-gauge sclerotherapy needle is introduced through a side port in the clamp and directed into the infundibulum. The cholangiogram is obtained prior to any dissection in the triangle of Calot, thereby avoiding iatrogenic common bile duct injuries due to misidentification of the cystic duct or anomalous anatomy. To date no pathology has been missed and no complications have resulted from this technique."
CD009323,0,7992153,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Do preoperative factors predict the need to convert to open?,"We reviewed our experience with the last 587 laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed between May 1990 and January 1993 to correlate preoperative findings that may predict the conversion of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to that of an open procedure. The prediction of a need to convert to an open cholecystectomy would allow the surgeon to discuss the higher risk of conversion with the patient and also allow for an earlier intraoperative decision to convert if difficulty was encountered. In addition to routine demographic data, ultrasound reports were available for 526 patients and the following information was recorded: presence of stones, thickened gallbladder wall, common bile duct dilatation, gallbladder sludge, and cystic duct impaction. Overall, a two times higher rate of conversion was found for male patients and patients with a body mass index > 27.2 kg/m2. Additionally, a thickened gallbladder wall on preoperative ultrasound was correlated with a six times higher conversion rate to open cholecystectomy. As expected, the positive intraoperative cholangiogram was associated with a higher incidence of conversion. Additionally, finding a dilated common bile duct on ultrasound was found to be associated with a nearly seven times higher rate of positive intraoperative cholangiogram. No statistical significance was found between conversion and age, previous abdominal operations, the presence of stones, common bile duct dilatation, gallbladder sludge, cystic duct impaction, or a distended gallbladder. Thus, these predictive findings allow the surgeon to preoperatively discuss the higher risk of conversion and allow for an earlier judgment decision to convert if intraoperative difficulty is encountered."
CD009323,0,7982547,0,[Diagnosis and therapy of adnexal tumors in postmenopause. A prospective study].,"The management of postmenopausal adnexal tumours is still controversially discussed. Approximately 30% of all postmenopausal tumours are malignant. The standard operative approach for these adnexal masses is still the exploratory laparotomy although the advantages of laparoscopic procedure are obvious, even in older patients. The aim of this prospective study was to find out to what extent diagnostic-operative laparoscopy is able to replace laparotomy in the therapy of postmenopausal adnexal masses. From January 1990 to August 1992, 169 postmenopausal patients entered the prospective study. After careful preoperative diagnostics, 63 patients underwent a laparotomy (group B) and 106 patients a laparoscopy (group A). 10 of these 106 cases underwent laparotomy after diagnostic laparoscopy (group Ab). The main operative procedure in group Aa was laparoscopic adnexectomy after Semm. Mean operative time and mean postoperative hospital stay were significantly lower in patients, who only underwent laparoscopic operation (group Aa). One case (0.9%) of the laparoscopically operated patients was subsequently found to be malignant (histologic assessment) and immediately treated by laparotomy with hysterectomy and contralateral adnexectomy. The combination of vaginal examination, vaginal/abdominal ultrasonography (tumor marker CA 125) and a sufficient preoperative diagnostic during endosurgery (no proliferations on the ovary or peritoneal surface, no ascites) reduces the risk of operating a malignant tumour by laparoscopy to a minimum. We believe that operative laparoscopy of postmenopausal adnexal masses is a safe and efficient method in carefully selected women."

Quality control is of great importance in new areas of technical development where standards do not yet exist. By recording detailed documentation of patient data, indications, operative procedures and initial follow-up we can compare this new technology with the gold standard therapy. This documentation system for thoracoscopic interventions was developed together with the Swiss Group of Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgeons. This pilot project of 85 consecutive thoracoscopic interventions will demonstrate the acceptability, clinical application and ease with which data can be analyzed. Operative techniques are described in detail: 20 diagnostic interventions with biopsy, 19 apical parietal pleurectomies (+/- resections of bullous lung tissue), 10 therapeutic lung tissue resections, 19 palliative pleurodesis, 5 treatments of pleural empyema, 1 mediastinal tumor resection, 1 esophagectomy, 4 thoracic sympathectomies plus 6 other procedures. Data entry is efficient with mean total time of 10 min for each record. All of the data are entered into a computer database. The possibilities for interpreting and combining this data are presented. The operative techniques can easily be related with history, indications, anesthesia, complications and results. First evaluation of thoracoscopic efficiency is possible. In addition, a detailed analysis of intra- and postoperative complications and of the hospital course can be performed."

A total of 41 injuries (surgeons' survey, 22; endoscopists' survey, 19) occurred in an estimated 4000 laparoscopic cholecystectomies; 16 involved the common bile and hepatic ducts, and 25 the cystic and segment V ducts. Operative cholangiography was performed in one patient. The diagnosis of injury was made after operation in 31 of 41 patients and after discharge in 21. Conservative management was undertaken in only 19 patients. This prospective audit documents an increase in the incidence of early biliary injury after the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in New Zealand. The results highlight the need for further study to determine the best way to ensure early and accurate diagnosis of biliary injury and to define optimal conservative and operative management."

CD009323,0,7952442,0,Hemobilia as a complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic surgery, mainly laparoscopic cholecystectomy, is a recently developed surgical procedure that has rapidly gained acceptance. Its complications remain to be critically analyzed. In this initial series of 69 patients, the rate of complications was 4.3%, and the conversion to open rate was 8.7%. A late complication occurring 4 months after surgery is presented. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding from hemobilia resulted from a cystic artery aneurysm communication with the cystic duct. This study stresses the importance of careful management of biliary structures to avoid the possibility of late and severe complications that can result from using this new surgical procedure."
CD009323,0,7952434,0,Right portal embolization before extended right hepatectomy using laparoscopic catheterization of the ileocolic vein: a prospective study.,"Preoperative embolization of the right portal vein branch before extended right hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma or hilar cholangiocarcinoma has been recommended for the prevention of postoperative liver failure. Percutaneous transhepatic insertion into the intrahepatic portal vein and insertion into the ileocolic vein at open laparotomy are used for inserting a catheter introducer into the portal vein. We devised a new technique for the laparoscopic insertion of a catheter introducer into the ileocolic vein and used it for right portal embolization in three patients. Measurement of hepatic volume by computed tomography 3 weeks after right portal embolization showed a 28.6 to 66.0% increase in the volume of the predicted remnant liver. This minimally invasive procedure has three advantages: reduction of postoperative pain, avoidance of hepatic injury, and the opportunity for a laparoscopic observation of the liver and the intra-abdominal organs before right portal embolization and hepatectomy."
CD009323,0,7949381,0,Prospective analysis of 40 initial laparoscopic colorectal resections: a plea for a randomized trial.,"The experience reported herein is on our initial 40 cases of laparoscopic-assisted (LA) colorectal resection that were prospectively evaluated. The operations were performed for colonic tumors of the right segment (n = 4), sigmoid (n = 11), or rectum (n = 7), diverticular disease (n = 17), and chronic constipation (n = 1). Among 22 tumors, 11 were malignant. The operative procedures were 4 right hemicolectomies, 28 segmental left colectomies, 5 anterior resections, 2 abdominoperineal resections, and 1 total colectomy. Thirty-one patients (77.5%) had a successfully completed LA resection. The reasons for conversion in the majority of the cases (66.6%) were difficulties in dissection. In the entirely LA procedures, the mean flatus postoperative day was 3, the mean postoperative hospitalization was 10.7 days, and there were 8 complications (25%) in 7 patients. Two patients were reoperated 2 and 3 months later for adhesion and ischemic stenosis of the colon above the anastomosis. There was 1 death in the LA group (3.2%). The length of operative specimen was 19.6 cm, and the mean number of resected lymph node was six. In contrast to laparoscopic biliary surgery, the benefits of LA colorectal surgery are not obvious. A randomized trial comparing LA and open colorectal resection must be carried out."
CD009323,0,7947632,0,Implication of laparoscopy and peritoneal cytology in the staging of early pancreatic cancer.,"Staging of pancreatic cancer still represents a challenge for surgeons involved in this field. Diagnostic methods of radiological imaging used routinely (CT, NMR, angiography) may understage this neoplasm. In fact, the presence of peritoneal or subglissonian hepatic micrometastases (< 2 cm) is a frequent surprise at laparotomy and forces the surgeon to use a palliative procedure. Actually this policy has not to be followed because the possibility to perform non-surgical palliation of jaundice or pain respectively by percutaneous radiological stent insertion and celiac alcoholization. In this viewpoint, preoperative staging has acquired an important role for a correct treatment, be it surgical or medical. Laparoscopy allows it to overcome the understaging produced by the more common diagnostic means, with the possibility to view directly the celomatic space and the surface of the abdominal viscera; moreover, during this procedure it is possible to perform a peritoneal washing to obtain other information about the cancer stage. In our experience, 56 patients were judged as resectable by radiologic methods; 31 were excluded from surgery by laparoscopy; 10 of the remaining 25 cases were submitted to radical resection. The operative resectability rate resulted in 40%, against 18% in cases where we submitted to surgery all the patients. Seven patients underwent peritoneal washing, always with a negative result; all were submitted to surgery and radically resected. In our opinion, laparoscopy and peritoneal washing represent useful tools in the staging of patients affected by pancreatic cancer."

CD009323,0,8092457,0,[CO2--emphysema in laparoscopic surgery. Changes in pulmonary CO2-elimination].,"We report on two patients with subcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO2) emphysema that developed during laparoscopic surgery with CO2 pneumoperitoneum (PP), in whom pulmonary elimination of CO2 (ECO2, Servo ventilator with integrated CO2 analyzer 930, Siemens) was continuously monitored. Patient 1 was a 61-year-old man with laparoscopic herniotomy. ECO2 immediately before PP was 120 ml/min x m2 and increased rapidly after 45 min PP to a maximum value of 340 ml/min x m2. At that time, minute ventilation had been increased from 7 to 11 l/min and PaCO2 had risen from 35 to 57 mm Hg. At the end of the procedure the patient showed excessive subcutaneous emphysema. Patient 2 was a 71-year-old woman in whom diagnostic laparoscopy was performed for staging of a pancreatic tumor. ECO2 immediately before PP was 140 ml/min x m2, increasing dramatically after 45 min PP to a maximum value of 529 ml/min x m2 (Fig. 1). At that time minute ventilation had been increased from 6.2 to 12.5 l/min and PaCO2 had risen from 40 to 77 mm Hg. PP was terminated and the patient was found to have extreme subcutaneous emphysema. She was mechanically ventilated for a further 40 min to normalize PaCO2 and ECO2. It seems reasonable to suppose that an increase in ECO2 by more than 100% of control during CO2-PP is an early sign of CO2 emphysema. In this situation hypercapnia is potentially life-threatening. Evidently, reabsorption of CO2 from loose connective tissue is far more rapid and effective than CO2 resorption from the peritoneal cavity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009323,0,8063230,0,Imaging of the common bile duct in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Options for managing the common bile duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy include routine peroperative cholangiography and selected preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The use of these methods was reviewed in 350 patients with symptomatic gall stones referred for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Unit A (n = 114) performed routine cystic duct cholangiography but undertook preoperative ERCP in patients at very high risk of duct stones only; unit B (n = 236) performed selected preoperative ERCP on the basis of known risk factors for duct stones. The detection rate for common bile duct stones was similar for units A and B (16% v 20%). In unit A, five of seven patients who had preoperative ERCP had duct stones. Operative cholangiography was technically successful in 90% of patients and duct stones were confidently identified in 13, one of whom went on to immediate open duct exploration. Postoperative ERCP identified duct stones in only four patients, indicating spontaneous passage in eight. In unit B, preoperative ERCP was undertaken in 76 of 236 (32%) patients and duct stones were identified in 47 (20%). Duct clearance was successful in 42 (18%) but failed in five (2%), necessitating elective open duct exploration. Both protocols for imaging the common bile duct worked well and yielded satisfactory short term results."

The cases were treated by endoscopic techniques and/or minimal invasive procedures. An increased pressure of the biliary system may contribute to biliary fistulae. This can be secondary to Oddi's sphincter disfunction, and/or the use of metallic clip in adverse conditions. The opportune diagnosis and treatment prevent major complications. The initial endoscopic management is adequate to diagnose and solve this complication. The minimal invasive surgery is a good alternative to solve those cases that need additional treatment."

Such complications can produce a misleading clinical picture, as in two cases we observed. Case 1. A symptomatic 56-year-old female patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. During the operation, the gall bladder ruptured and the contents had to be aspirated from the abdominal cavity. The patient complained of hepatalgia 2 weeks after the operation, then was not seen again for more than 1 year when fever and hepatalgia did not respond to symptomatic treatment. An inter-hepato-renal collection (6 cm in diameter) was punctured under echography. Aspirate culture yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Adapted antibiotic therapy was unsuccessful and surgery was required to empty the abscess then remove a fibrous conjunctive tissue formation. Case 2. A 55-year-old female patient with a history of complete remission after mammectomy for breast cancer underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1991. Two days after the operation, fever (39 degrees C) was accompanied by abdominal defence. Biliary peritonitis due to imperfect suture of the bile duct was repaired followed by peritoneal lavage-drainage. Per-operative blood samples revealed type 6 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Despite adapted parenteral antibiotics, fever persisted at 39 degrees C and intense jaundice was observed. A second laparoscopy 14 days later showed inflammatory narrowing of the main bile duct which was drained into a small bowel loop. Eight days later computed tomography revealed multiple abscess in the liver. Transparietal cholangiography was performed and showed that the contrast medium entered the abscesses via the biliary canals. The state of sepsis persisted, jaundice worsened and hepatic encephalopathy developed with obnubilation and flapping tremor. After 1 month of general antibiotherapy, no improvement was seen on computed tomography images and needle biopsy of an abscess led to the identification of resistant type 6 P. aeruginosa. Antibiotics were adapted and administered iv with no clinical improvement. Selective catheterism of the hepatic artery via the femoral access was performed to allow intra-hepatic antibiotic delivery. Three weeks later clinical situation remained unchanged when acute respiratory distress highly suggestive of pulmonary embolism led to death. Autopsy was not performed. In both of these rare cases of infectious complications due to P. aeruginosa after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the source of contamination remained unknown. Nosocomial infection was suspected."

However, it was not until 1959 that Alonzo-Lej and colleagues reported on the full description and classification of choledochal cysts. This report describes a Hispanic female who presented with classic findings consistent with biliary colic. A preoperative ultrasound revealed multiple gallstones and mild dilatation of the common bile duct. At the time of laparoscopy, she was found to have a dilated common bile duct, cystic duct, and gallbladder. Further dissection was discontinued, a cholecystectomy made, and a percutaneous transabdominal cholangiogram through the gallbladder performed, which revealed a type I choledochal cyst (cystic dilatation of the extrahepatic bile ducts). The patient then underwent resection of the extrahepatic biliary tree with a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Her subsequent postoperative course was uneventful. This case illustrates the role of cholangiography using the gallbladder as a conduit in the diagnosis of complex biliary tree anomalies during laparoscopy when the biliary tree cannot be safely accessed."
CD009323,0,8044356,0,Diagnosis and management of bile leaks following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now the standard of care for the elective management of gallstone disease. Recent studies have shown the morbidity of laparoscopic cholecystectomy to be similar to that of open cholecystectomy. Postoperative bile leaks have been recognized to be a troublesome problem following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We present a retrospective review of 854 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy at a single institution. Records were reviewed of all patients identified as having postoperative bile leaks. Between January 1990 and April 1991, we have cared for, or been referred, 15 patients with postlaparoscopic cholecystectomy bile leaks (9/854, 1.1% index patients and 6 referred). The location of bile leakage was determined to be the common bile duct (CBD) in two, cystic duct in five, and small accessory ducts located close to the gallbladder bed in the remaining eight. Most patients presented in the first week following laparoscopic cholecystectomy (mean 4.3 +/- 0.7 days, range 2-10) with worsening abdominal pain (13/13, 100%), nausea, and low-grade fever (mean 99.6 +/- 0.3 degrees F, range 96.8-102.2). Eleven of fifteen (66.7%) patients underwent technectium-99m imidodiacetic acid scanning (Tc-99m IDA) to determine the presence of a possible bile leak. All eleven scans were positive, indicating the presence of a bile leak. Thirteen patients underwent endoscopic cholangiography confirming the presence of biliary leakage (the remaining two patients underwent prompt laparotomy). Five patients were taken to the operating room for management of their leaks (two with common bile duct injuries, two cystic duct leaks, one accessory duct leak).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Since its introduction there has been an increase in postoperative diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The aim of this study was to assess the indications and results of ERCP following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Sixty-one patients had an ERCP following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Two broad groups were identified: Group 1 (35 patients) had filling defects (consistent with stones) noted on operative cholangiography, which were not successfully flushed or extracted at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy; Group 2 consisted of patients who developed problems following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Nine patients had post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy pain with abnormal liver function tests (LFT), four of whom had common bile duct (CBD) injuries and three had CBD stones. Eleven patients had post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy pain with a normal diameter common bile duct on ultrasound and normal LFT; only one had a CBD stone. Five patients with a persisting bile leak following laparoscopic cholecystectomy had an ERCP and endoscopic sphincterotomy. In three the leak ceased, while two required subsequent open surgery to drain bile collections and ligate the cystic duct. One patient presented with an episode of transient jaundice but had a normal ERCP. There were six post-ERCP complications; three patients had mild pancreatitis, two had a minor haemorrhage and one an asymptomatic duodenal perforation. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy was most valuable for the management of retained stones and the diagnosis and management of post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy pain in association with abnormal LFT. The diagnostic yield was low (9%) when the LFT were normal."

Gruppo italiano per lo studio dell'endometriosi.,"We have evaluated the prevalence of endometriosis in selected gynaecological conditions requiring surgery. Eligible for the study were women with primary or secondary sterility, chronic pelvic pain, fibroids or benign ovarian cysts requiring laparoscopy or laparotomy consecutively observed during the study period in 23 obstetrics and gynaecology departments in Italy between May 1991 and July 1992. Women with a previous diagnosis of endometriosis were specifically excluded. A total of 3684 subjects entered the study. Of these, 660 (mean age 31 years) were included for sterility, 409 (mean age 32) for chronic pelvic pain, 1880 (mean age 42) for fibroids and 735 (mean age 33) for benign ovarian cysts. During the surgical procedure surgeons were asked to examine the pelvis carefully to identify endometriosis. Out of the 660 women included for sterility, 195 [30%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 26-35] had endometriosis; the corresponding figures were 185 out of 409 (45%, 95% CI 39-52) for pelvic pain, 219 out of 1880 (12%, 95% CI 10-14) for fibroids and 257 out of 735 (35%, 95% CI 31-40) for ovarian cysts; these differences were significant (chi2(3) heterogeneity, absence versus presence = 323.9, P < 0.001). Among women with endometriosis who entered the study for sterility, 51% were at stage 1, 22% at stage 2, 20% at stage 3 and 7% at stage 4. The corresponding figures for pelvic pain and fibroids were largely similar: 37%, 24%, 30%, 10% for women with pelvic pain, 36%, 11%, 45% and 8% for those with fibroids, but among cases with ovarian cysts stage 3 was over-represented (62% of cases).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The advent of laparoscopic contact ultrasonography has enhanced the diagnostic and staging potential of laparoscopy. In addition to laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute gallstone-associated pancreatitis, the following operations have been performed laparoscopically: bilio-enteric bypass and gastrojejunostomy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer; internal drainage for pseudocysts; resection of insulinomas; distal resection for chronic pancreatitis; and pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer. Aside from cholecystectomy, there is as yet, insufficient information to conclude on the advantages of these laparoscopic approaches although the early results, particularly in the palliation of patients with malignant jaundice, are promising.

Patients in this group were studied preoperatively with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). In 26 patients (39%), the diagnosis was confirmed. In 12 other cases (18%), the macroscopic finding of a stripped or bleeding papilla without common bile duct stones suggested stone migration. ERCP in the remaining 29 patients (43%) was normal. Thirty-four endoscopic sphincterotomies (ES) were performed, 26 for common bile duct stones and 8 for cystic lithiasis or gallbladder microlithiasis. In the entire group of patients with choledocholithiasis, stone removal was possible. All 67 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy on an average of 2.8 days following the endoscopic procedure. Twenty-one patients (31%) had acute cholecystitis, and 5 had chronic scleroatrophic cholecystitis. Five (7.5%) of the 67 patients were converted to an open procedure. In 10 cases (16%), the cystic diameter was larger than an 8-mm M-L clip, which made necessary the use of endoligature or extra clips. No complications or deaths resulted from ERCP or ES. Two of the 62 patients (3.2%) who underwent LC had to be reoperated on, 1 because of a right subphrenic collection, and the other because of bilious ascites.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic value of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the management of complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We therefore report on the result of 49 ERCP after laparoscopic cholecystectomy done at our department between January 1991 and March 1993. Patients were referred from 16 different surgical institutions. In 29 cases endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed without complications. Indications for ERCP were ""persistent biliary pain"" (n = 27), bile leakage (n = 7), pancreatitis (n = 5), abscess (n = 5), painless jaundice (n = 3) and asymptomatic bile duct stone in routine cholangiography (n = 2). In the group of patients with ""persistent biliary pain"" we found bile duct stones in 12 (80%) of 15 cases with cholestasis and in 3 (30%) of 10 without cholestasis. The stones were endoscopically removed after sphincterotomy. In 2 patients without cholestasis, cannulation of the bile duct failed. 7 patients showed biliary leakage, 4 from inadequate clipping of the cystic stump (2 in combination with a common bile duct stone), 2 from the hepatic duct and 1 from insufficient anastomosis after reconstruction of a common bile duct. After endoscopic sphincterotomy and, if necessary, stone extraction by Dormia basket, leakage from the cystic stump and hepatic duct healed. The insufficient common bile duct anastomosis required reconstruction by hepaticojejunostomy.

In order to address this debate, we asked the following questions: What intraoperative information is provided to the surgeon? What IOC criteria or standards are necessary to observe this information? Between 1990 and 1993, 624 laparoscopic cholangiography (LC) cases were performed at Virginia Mason Hospital, during which 86% (535) of the patients underwent successfully performed IOCs. Each of these cholangiograms was sought, and 420 (78%) were reviewed by a radiologist and a surgeon. Specific items involved the presence or absence of filling defects, bile duct diameter, contrast leaks, flow into the duodenum, benign or malignant stricture, contrast in a portion of the pancreatic duct, and anomalous ducts. ""Relevant findings"" were defined as filling defects, stricture, leaks, and the following anomalous ducts: a bile duct from the right side of the liver entering near or into the cystic duct. The entire biliary tree was visualized in 86%, and the bifurcation was seen in 95% of the cases. Considering these deficiencies, we found a 10% incidence of filling defects. Anomalies were common in the biliary tree (39%), and knowledge of the presence of some of them are important for safe dissection (at least 4%). Also, at least 68 relevant findings would have been missed in 420 LC cases without IOC. If the IOC had not visualized the biliary tree proximal to the cystic duct, 30 of 68 or 44% of these findings would not have been observed. If an IOC is performed on a routine or selective basis, the study should visualize the entire biliary tree."

CD009323,0,8091785,0,Minimizing the risk of bile duct injury at laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,The introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has been associated with an increase in the incidence of operative bile duct injuries. An operative technique that involves commencing the laparoscopic dissection on the body of the gallbladder and dissecting toward the cystic duct has been developed that minimizes the risk of major duct injury. The aim of this study was to assess prospectively the safety of this dissection technique. A group of 410 patients underwent LC for symptomatic cholelithiasis from January 1991 to December 1992. There was a single common hepatic duct injury: a small (1 mm) side hole in a patient with acute cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis. It was managed at open operation with exploration of the common bile duct and insertion of a T-tube. There were no partial or complete common bile duct transections in this series. We concluded that the technique of commencing the dissection on the gallbladder is safe and minimizes the risk of serious common bile duct injury at LC.
CD009323,0,8067156,0,Pitfalls in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"On the basis of literature and of 475 laparoscopic cholecystectomies of the authors, some pitfalls are reviewed. The circumstances, the mechanism and the prevention of injuries were detailed together with the connected problem of postoperative bile leakage. Among the cholangiographic pitfalls the importance of detection of congenital and acquired anomalies of the biliary tree by means of preoperative ERCP or intraoperative trans-cystic cholangiograms was emphasized. A particular study was made of 3 pictures: Mirizzi syndrome; stone impaction in Vater's papilla; no retrograde flow of the common hepatic duct on intraoperative cholangiograms. Biliodigestive fistulas were briefly commented. The problems with cystic duct stones, particularly the treatment of stones in a long, low inserted cystic duct with retroduodenal course and the closing of thick-walled or wide cystic stumps, were explained. In patients with intraoperative residual common bile duct stones and with failed preoperative catheterization of the papilla, the authors advocate their double approach technique. This combined intraoperative laparoscopic and postoperative endoscopic procedure is carried out via the same transcystic polythene catheters as used for cholangiography and external biliary drainage of the common bile duct."

In agreement with other authors we think that laparoscopic unroofing of non-parasitic liver cysts is a method with promising future. The necessity of an intraoperative cholangiography in case of a bile leak respectively recurrence prophylaxis by means of an omentum major plastic will be decided by further clinical investigation.

After intraoperative cholangiography laparoscopic removal of CBDS can be achieved via the cystic duct or a choledochotomy using a thin cholangioscope, balloon catheters and Dormia baskets. Lithotripsy (electrohydraulic or laser) is necessary in presence of larger stones. Also combined procedures with intraoperative antegrade or retrograde papillotomy have been described.

CD009323,0,8044561,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary pancreatitis.,"A prospective study was undertaken to assess the technical difficulty of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute biliary pancreatitis. Patients underwent early endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed after signs of clinical improvement. Five steps were assessed during surgery using a visual analogue score. These patients were compared with a control group undergoing elective surgery for chronic symptomatic gallstones. Of 24 patients aged 28-83 (median 60) years, eight had three or more positive signs according to Ranson's criteria. Twenty-three patients underwent successful ERC; seven had choledocholithiasis and were managed endoscopically. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed 3-24 (median 7) days after admission was successful in 21 of the 24 patients. The mean(s.d.) operative difficulty score was significantly increased in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis compared with that in the 40 controls (5.4(1.8) versus 3.6(1.4), P < 0.002), particularly for dissection of Calot's triangle (6.5(1.5) versus 3.0(1.6), P < 0.001). A dilated cystic duct was present in over 50 per cent of patients and in seven could not be safely closed with a clip; this finding was not predicted by ERC. Biliary pancreatitis is a further indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Early surgery is safe but technical difficulty is increased. Cystic duct dilatation must be anticipated; an externally tied ligature in continuity is recommended."

Repeat of the procedure was necessary in 22% of cases when the mobile x-ray equipment was used. Aside from the detection of unsuspected stones in 18 patients (3.9%), routine intraoperative cholangiography identified four patients (0.8%) whose management would undoubtedly have been disadvantaged if intraoperative cholangiography had not been performed."
CD009323,0,8209298,0,Cholecystocholangiography vs cystic duct cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A prospective controlled trial.,"Intraoperative cholangiography performed during laparoscopic cholecystectomy provides an exact picture of the biliary anatomy. It may prevent iatrogenic bile duct injury and detect unsuspected common duct stones. Laparoscopic cannulation of the cystic duct can be difficult and time-consuming. We therefore evaluated the simpler technique of cholecystocholangiography by direct puncture and filling of the gallbladder with contrast medium. This technique was compared with cystic duct cholangiography in a prospective controlled trial of 69 patients. Cystic duct cholangiography (n = 38) showed significantly better results than cholecystocholangiography (n = 31) with optimal visualization of the biliary tree in 29 cases (76%) and seven cases (22%), respectively. The failure rate was 8% and 52%, respectively. Delineation of the cystic duct junction is important in order to prevent bile duct injury. The anatomy in this region was clearly delineated in 34 cases (89.5%) using cystic duct cholangiography but only in 11 cases (35.5%) with cholecystocholangiography. Cystic duct cholangiography revealed unsuspected common duct stones in three cases; however, choledocholithiasis was missed by cholecystocholangiography in at least two patients. Cystic duct cholangiography is clearly the optimal technique. In situations of unclear anatomy in which safe dissection of the cystic duct is not possible, cholecystocholangiography remains a useful alternative."
CD009323,0,8180767,0,Cost-effective laparoscopic cholangiography.,"Cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is an invaluable tool for detecting occult bile duct calculi and identifying biliary tract anatomy. Attaining proficiency in cannulation of the cystic duct is an important goal for those interested in laparoscopic transcystic common duct manipulation. A variety of disposable equipment is available for this purpose, but most systems are rather costly for the patient. This report describes our experience with a technique for cholangiography that is both highly successful and inexpensive. It consists of a reusable 8"" stainless steel blunt-tipped needle and trocar introducer through which a 4-French, disposable, end-hole catheter is placed into the duct and secured with a single clip. A 0.25 hydrophilic guidewire is placed through this catheter to facilitate proper catheter placement when cystic duct cannulation is difficult. Blunt-tip reusable nylon rods are placed in each trocar site to provide unobstructed visualization of the biliary tract during the fluoroscopy or filming procedures. Thirty-seven consecutive patients had successful cholangiograms during laparoscopic cholecystectomy using this technique, including the use of the guidewire in five patients, without complications. The catheter was advanced into the common duct and secured with clips to provide postoperative duct drainage in two patients with unsuspected common duct stones and very small cystic ducts until successful postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) stone extractions were done. Three additional patients had occult common duct stones discovered during operative cholangiography. All patients were successfully treated postoperatively with ERCP sphincterotomy and stone extraction without complications. Our technique provides successful, cost-effective operative cholangiography, including cases when cystic duct cannulation is difficult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009323,0,8180763,0,Endoscopic sphincterotomy for the treatment of cystic duct leak following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,Two patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy had postoperative cystic duct leak from slipped metallic clips. One patient presented with biliary ascites and the other with biliocutaneous fistula. Open surgery done in the first patient was not successful in controlling the fistula. Rapid closure of the fistulae was achieved in both cases using endoscopic sphincterotomy.
CD009323,0,8081933,0,Update on laparoscopic ultrasonography.,"Ultrasonography has many clinical applications and can be done with both extra- and intracorporeal techniques. Miniaturization of ultrasound transducers has opened the way for intracorporeal use of ultrasound at laparoscopy. The principles of ultrasonography are presented. Laparoscopic intracorporeal ultrasound (LICU) has proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis of liver tumours. In one series, 75 of 85 patients had positive identification of a suspected liver tumour with laparoscopic ultrasound examination. LICU has also been useful for delineation of hepatobiliary anatomy during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in both animal models and patients having cholecystectomy. LICU may detect useful anatomic information prior to dissection of the cystic duct and is accurate in detecting common bile duct stones. LICU may also be useful in the preoperative staging of pancreatic malignancy. Laparoscopic intracorporeal ultrasound may find practical application in other areas as experience evolves."
CD009323,0,8081932,0,Echolaparoscopy: an indispensable procedure for laparoscopic surgery.,"The widespread use of operative and diagnostic laparoscopy leads to growing use of laparoscopic ultrasound as a complementary procedure. A preliminary study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic ultrasound using a linear array laparoscopic probe characterised by double frequency, mechanical flexibility and availability of Doppler analysis. Twenty-five cases of cholecystolithiasis were evaluated during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in comparison with laparoscopic cholangiography: no differences were observed. Nine cases of gastrointestinal neoplasms (gastric, colon, pancreatic, and liver cancer) were evaluated in comparison with preoperative sonography and computed tomography. Laparoscopic sonography improves abdominal malignancy detection (cancer spread, lymph node metastasis, liver metastasis), thus modifying therapeutic decisions. The possibility of moving the probe in flexion extension movements allows a complete, multiplane exploration of operative fields. Laparoscopic sonography represents a complementary, indispensable diagnostic method during laparoscopic surgery."
CD009323,0,8081931,0,Clinical experience with sector scan and linear array ultrasound probes in laparoscopic surgery.,"Laparoscopic ultrasonography combines the advantages of diagnostic laparoscopy and intraoperative contact ultrasonography. The early prototypes were based on the linear array intraoperative ultrasound transducer, which provided the hepatobiliary surgeon with detailed information on the hepatic and pancreatic tumour in addition to its relationship with the associated vasculature. The laparoscopic linear array probes provide similar information in patients submitted to diagnostic laparoscopy and provide the surgeon with rectilinear images that are easy to interpret. Laparoscopic sector scanning probes are now available and have the advantage of requiring only a small area of contact to produce a pie-shaped scan of the area of interest. Such images may be more difficult to orientate, but end viewing probes enable rapid changes in image direction when rotated and are probably the probe of choice in the detection of choledocholithiasis. At the present time, the laparoscopic ultrasonographer may have need of both probes to enable adequate evaluation of intraabdominal pathology. Technological advances will almost certainly provide more versatile ultrasound systems that will confirm the place of laparoscopic ultrasonography as a valuable investigative tool during laparoscopic procedures."
CD009323,0,8081930,0,Laparoscopic ultrasonography: limits and potential of present technologies.,"During recent years, laparoscopic contact sonography has been introduced into clinical practice to remedy the limitations of minimal invasive surgery. The technology of laparoscopic ultrasound probes is described in this paper as well as the technique of US contact scanning via the laparoscopic approach. This method is a tool which allows the examination of tissues and non-palpable parenchymal organs in endoscopic surgery, thus permitting correct assessment of both anatomy and the spreading of neoplasms, with consequent impact upon surgical decision making."
CD009323,0,8043924,0,Cystic duct stabilization during laparoscopic exploration and stone removal.,"A modification of the standard method for cystic duct stabilization is presented. A percutaneously placed suture is used to loop and stabilize the cystic duct. The suture is secured outside the abdominal wall at the skin level using a clamp. Percutaneous suture stabilization of the cystic duct provides an alternative method of common bile duct stabilization when laparoscopic choledochotomy is required. By using this method, we can easily stabilize the cystic duct without the need for additional trocars and simplify the use of the choledochoscope."
CD009323,0,8020366,0,[Laparoscopic sonography with an ultrasound endoscope].,"Abdominal ultrasound is one of the major diagnostic tools for preoperative staging of malignancies. However this technique is limited by meteorismus and other physical factors (adipositas, ribs). Intraabdominal laparoscopic ultrasound is a valuable technique to overcome these limitations. A flexible echoendoscope was evaluated for this purpose. Being flexible the echoendoscope can be directed easily even to regions that are usually not accessible. Therefore this minimally invasive technique provides the chance to obtain precise tissue diagnosis by ultrasound guided biopsies through the biopsy channel while contemporary visualisation is possible."
CD009323,0,8020361,0,[Laparoscopic pancreatocystojejunostomy without entero-entero-anastomosis].,"The gradual enlargement of a persistent pancreatic pseudocyst generally requires intervention. When the decision to carry out an operative procedure is made, preference should be given to internal rather than external drainage. We have developed a simple technique in which the pseudocyst is approached directly, to make a pancreatico-cystojejunostomy, which does not require a Braun- or Roux-en-Y anastomosis. We present our laparoscopic method, which opens up new possibilities in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts."
CD009323,0,8020342,0,[Pancreatic carcinoma--preoperative diagnosis and indications for surgery].,"Symptomatic pancreas tumors are diagnosed in general by ERCP, transabdominal ultrasonography, and computed tomography. Endoscopic ultrasonography, angiography (facultative) and video laparoscopy in combination with laparoscopic sonography and peritoneal lavage are providing preoperatively important additional information about the spreading of the tumor. Preoperative diagnostic procedures should allow the surgeon to exclude patients with an unresectable tumor from extended resection. In most of these patients satisfactory palliation can be achieved endoscopically. The indication for surgical treatment of resectable pancreatic tumors is based on the mortality of pancreaticoduodenectomy far beyond 5% in experienced centers. Improved surgical techniques and improved perioperative management together with the implementation of accurate preoperative analysis of risk factors allow resection of primary pancreatic tumors with a low morbidity and mortality."
CD009323,0,7914773,0,An uncommon cause of biliary obstruction (Mirizzi syndrome): report of five cases.,"Mirizzi syndrome is a rare form of common hepatic duct obstruction resulting from an inflammatory response secondary to a gallstone impacted in the cystic duct or neck of the gallbladder. Herein, we report five patients with this syndrome. Clinically, all patients had prominent jaundice. Ultrasound examination showed a large stone in the neck of the gallbladder. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography demonstrated a filling defect in the biliary tract the cystic duct level. Four patients possessed cholecystobiliary fistulas. Two patients also had common bile duct stones. Operations included simple cholecystectomy in one patient, and partial cholecystectomy with choledochoplasty with the use of gallbladder flap and T-tube insertion in the other four patients. All patients were uneventfully discharged. If a patient has clinical obstructive jaundice, a huge stone encased in the neck of the gallbladder and a filling defect of the biliary tract at the cystic duct level shown on a cholangiogram, Mirizzi syndrome must be considered. A cholecystobiliary fistula will probably be present if the cholangiogram further reveals an excavated filling defect or a block of the common duct; in this case, partial cholecystectomy and choledochoplasty with a gallbladder flap is the treatment of choice. Mirizzi syndrome is a contraindication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy which can easily result in common duct injury."

An alternative to cholangiography?,"The purpose of this study was to compare laparoscopic intracorporeal ultrasound (LICU) examination of the biliary duct system with cholangiography for delineation of duct anatomy and determination of presence or absence of ductal calculi. Thirty-one patients had LICU examination of the extrahepatic bile ducts after exposure of the gallbladder but prior to dissection of the cystic duct. After LICU examination, cystic duct dissection and cholangiography were done. Evaluation of duct anatomy and decision for duct exploration were based on findings of both tests. All patients had successful LICU examination and 30 had successful cholangiography. Duct size as determined by LICU corresponded precisely with cholangiography. LICU provided useful anatomical information in two patients with aberrant anatomy and detected cholangiogram. LICU aids in delineation of biliary duct anatomy and accurately determines presence or absence of duct calculi."

CD009323,0,8055231,0,Endoscopic treatment of laparoscopic bile duct injuries.,"Laparoscopic technique has become the norm for cholecystectomy, one of the most commonly performed operations. Unfortunately, the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been accompanied by a significant increase in bile duct injuries and a new set of postsurgical problems when compared with traditional, open cholecystectomy. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has emerged as a central method for diagnosis and treatment of bile duct injuries and other problems arising after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The most common biliary problems include bile leaks from the cystic duct remnant or one of the main ducts; ductal injury, such as disruption or strictures; retained common bile duct stones; or postoperative biliary-pancreatic pain. Building on the success of endoscopic treatment of biliary complications of traditional surgery, ERCP, in cooperation with radiological and surgical intervention, can facilitate definitive diagnosis and treatment of bile leaks and simple strictures. Complex strictures and complete disruptions are not amenable to endoscopic therapy and should be treated surgically. As experience in laparoscopic cholecystectomy increases, the incidence of bile duct injuries should decline; ERCP, however, will remain a valuable adjunctive modality."
CD009323,0,8042335,0,Evaluation of two training programs for laparoscopic cholecystectomy: incidence of major complications.,"To determine the need for a training program for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, we evaluated two programs by surveying perioperative complications. The two programs were completed by eight surgeons in each. Program A consisted of 10 supervised operations and program B of only 2. A total of 1054 operations were performed, and 12 major complications required conversion to open surgery owing to transection of the bile duct in 5 cases, laceration of the common bile duct in 1 case, delayed perforation of the common hepatic duct in 1 case, bile leakage in 2 cases, duodenal injury in 1 case, and bleeding from the cystic artery in 2 cases. The incidence of a major complication was significantly higher in group B than in group A, and six of the nine major complications in group B occurred during the initial seven independent operations. Overall, the most common major complication was an injury during the operation to the common bile duct or to the hepatic duct. Four of the five transections of the bile duct required Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, and the other required end-to-end anastomosis with T-tube drainage; one laceration required simple suture closure; and the one delayed perforation required T-tube drainage. The mean duration of hospitalization for 7 patients with an injury to the bile duct was 74.4 days (range 16-151 days). We recommend that a training program for laparoscopic cholecystectomy should include at least 10 operations to prevent a major complication during the initial 10 operations."
CD009323,0,8028730,0,[Use of ultrasonic surgery in laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy now represents a valid alternative to traditional surgery in the treatment of gallstone diseases. For the past twenty years laparotomic cholecystectomy has represented the golden standard of gallstone treatment given its extremely low mortality rate (0.5%) and equally acceptable morbidity rate. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy now appears to have taken over the position of elective treatment. Sophisticated techniques, such as ultrasound scalpels make this form of surgery particularly safe."
CD009323,0,8176594,0,Impact of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on the management of cholelithiasis in children with sickle cell disease.,"Children with sickle cell disease, well known to have a high incidence of cholelithiasis, are frequently admitted to the hospital for episodes of abdominal pain. Before the advent of laparoscopy, few children with sickle cell and cholelithiasis underwent cholecystectomy unless absolutely necessary, because of the high morbidity of an open cholecystectomy (OC). We reviewed our records of all children with sickle cell disease and cholelithiasis treated from 1985 to 1992 to investigate the impact of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). During that period, 32 children underwent cholecystectomy: 10 OC and 22 LC (all since December 1990). Before December 1990, all children had either classic biliary tract symptoms or abdominal pain of unknown etiology. However, of the 22 LC children, five had asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Only three of the 32 patients had choledocholithiasis, although 30 of 32 had elevated total bilirubins. Two LC children presented with choledocholithiasis and were initially treated with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stent placement. A standard intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) through the cystic duct was performed in all OC cases. In 19 of 22 LC cases, an IOC through the gallbladder was performed before any dissection; unsuspected choledocholithiasis was not found, but the IOC did allow visualization of the course of the cystic duct, facilitating its subsequent dissection. Total operative length was comparable between the two groups, but the LC patients' postoperative length of stay was half that of the OC patients (2.1 v 4.6 days). Postoperative complications in the OC group included three children who had severe pain, atelectasis, fever, and hypoxemia (30%)."

Most of these neoplasms are diagnosed clinically because of the difficulty in obtaining tissue that will provide histologic proof of the disease. When a non-operative course is sought, exhaustive attempts should be made to obtain a tissue diagnosis because of the potential for a false-positive clinical diagnosis. We describe a new way to obtain tissue for diagnosis by placing a laparoscopic choledochoscope through a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram track, thus allowing the tumor to be directly visualized and biopsied."
CD009323,0,8167860,0,Laparoscopically assisted colon resections compare favorably with open technique.,"To date, 14 patients have undergone laparoscopic or laparoscopically assisted colon resections for malignant disease. Margins of resection and lymph nodes (LNs) recovered were compared with those of 20 consecutive controls treated over the preceding 6-month period at the same institution. Of these 14 procedures, one was completed entirely via laparoscopy, 13 were laparoscopically assisted (a small transverse incision was used to deliver the colon and lesion after laparoscopic mobilization). One other patient required conversion to open colectomy. An average of 10.5 LNs (range 0-32) were recovered via the laparoscopic technique per case; 0.4 LNs showed positive signs of metastatic disease (range 0-4). Average margins of resection were 11.1 cm proximally and 10.0 cm distally (range 3-34) cm proximally, 2-23 cm distally). In no case did the margins contain tumor. These results compare favorably with those for the 20 concurrent controls, among whom an average of 7.6 LNs were recovered per case, 0.5 LNs with positive signs of metastatic disease (range 2-19 LNs total, 0-4 positive). Similarly, proximal margins averaged 7.4 cm, and distal margins averaged 14.2 cm (range 1.5-20 cm and 2-30 cm, respectively). Only one postoperative complication was directly related to the surgical procedure--a herniation of small bowel into a trocar site. One anastomotic stricture occurred 6 weeks after surgery, and one partial small-bowel obstruction was noted at 4 weeks. Both were treated nonoperatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009323,0,7515426,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: results of first 300 cases in Hong Kong.,"Prospective analysis of the first three hundred patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy was carried out in three surgical centres of Hong Kong. Over a 20-month period, 300 consecutive patients were recruited, including elective and emergency cases. The indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were symptomatic gallstones (78%), cholangitis (6%), pancreatitis (5%) and cholecystitis (11%). Patients with common duct stones (12) had preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction prior to cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was accomplished successfully in 287 patients. Thirteen patients (4.3%) required conversion to open cholecystectomy. The reasons for conversion were: inability to identify cystic duct and common bile duct clearly (6); bleeding (5); Mirizzi syndrome (1); and slippage of cystic duct clip (1). The median operation time was 80 min with a range of 28-270 min. The median hospital stay was 3 days. Seventy-five per cent of patients required only a single dose of pethidine injection. None of the patients required blood transfusion. The overall complication rate was 7%. These included mild cellulitis of the subumbilical wound (3%) and postoperative chest infection (3%). One patient developed subphrenic abscess which resolved on percutaneous drainage under ultrasound guidance. Iatrogenic injury to the common bile duct was seen in one patient who had an impacted stone at Hartmann's pouch. With adequate training laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely. The advantages over open cholecystectomy are less wound pain, better cosmesis and shorter convalescence."
CD009323,0,8144081,0,[Laparoscopic-assisted colectomy].,"After gaining experience in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic appendectomy and other laparoscopic procedures, we decided to perform laparoscopic-assisted colectomy. During July 1992 to February 1993 we performed 14 such procedures. Ages ranged from 46-83 years (mean, 68). In all cases the indication for surgery was neoplasm of the colon. 8 of the tumors were located in the right colon and 6 in the sigmoid. Procedures performed were laparoscopic-assisted right hemicolectomy with a biofragmentable anastomotic ring or laparoscopic-assisted sigmoidectomy with end-to-end anastomosis. In 1 operation we combined laparoscopic cholecystectomy with laparoscopic right hemicolectomy. Operation time varied from 90-130 min (mean, 100 min). In our opinion the procedure is as radical as standard laparotomy with the number of lymph nodes per specimen ranging from 4-10 (mean, 7); the surgical margins were free of tumor in all cases. There was less pain in the postoperative period than with the standard procedure and the average time from operation to discharge was 7 days (range, 5-9). Complications included 1 fatality due to postoperative myocardial infarction, and 1 case of duodenal perforation which was sutured during the operation. We conclude that laparoscopic-assisted right hemicolectomy and laparoscopic sigmoidectomy are feasible for carcinoma, and that recovery is quicker and with less pain. However, we need a larger series and long-term follow-up to conclude whether the laparoscopic assisted technic is an adequate operation in cases of cancer."
CD009323,0,10717090,0,The Role of Surgical Staging for Cervical Cancer.,"Recent trends in gynecologic oncology have favored surgical staging of disease not only to define local extent, but more importantly nodal involvement. For cervical cancer, surgical staging includes intraperitoneal exploration, cytological washings, direct tumor palpation, and para-aortic with or without pelvic lymph node (LN) dissection. In the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) experience, extraperitoneal selective para-aortic lymphadenectomy was associated with a lower risk of enteric complications following radiation for advanced cervical cancer and was, therefore, judged to be the preferred surgical procedure. In the GOG data base, para-aortic LN involvement was the most significant prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. If para-aortic LN were negative, pelvic LN metastases and tumor size were the most significant independent prognostic factors. Progression-free interval at 5 years decreased from 57% for patients with negative nodes to 34% and 12% for patients with pelvic or para-aortic LN metastases, respectively. As such, surgical staging must retain an integral role in protocol development to assure equal stratification of prognostic variables and, thereby, assess the benefit of innovative treatments for locally advanced cervical cancer in randomized prospective trials. The potential for lymphanglography and laparoscopy as alternatives to laparotomy are reviewed."

CD009323,0,8311137,0,Characteristics of biliary tract complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a multi-institutional study.,"We collected the records of 81 patients with biliary tract injuries occurring during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) who were referred to 3 referral centers during a 33-month (May 1990 to March 1993) period. All records were reviewed to provide data concerning the anatomy of the lesion induced, method of injury, timing of injury detection, role of intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), methods of treatment, and outcome of these injuries. Injuries were classified by our own method as follows: (1) cystic duct leaks (n = 15), (2) bile leaks and/or ductal strictures (n = 27), and (3) ductal transections or excisions (n = 39). Peak occurrence by quarter of the year was 4th quarter, 1990 (Lahey), and 3rd quarter, 1991 (Mason), and 1st quarter, 1992 (Mayo). The majority (62%) of the injuries were recognized after LC. At the time of LC, 31 of 81 (38%) injuries were recognized and converted to open procedures. Data regarding IOC were available in 63 of 81 (78%) cases. In patients in whom IOC was not performed, 14 of 38 (37%) operations were converted; if an IOC was obtained and interpreted correctly, 13 of 21 (62%) operations were converted. Primary repair was attempted in 11 leaks and/or strictures, but 36% required additional treatment. Primary repair was used in six transections or excisions, and 17% have required further intervention. In patients who had biliary-enteric bypass (BEB) performed outside (17) versus at the referral institution (29), 94% (16 patients) versus 0%, respectively, required additional operative (e.g., revision of a hepaticojejunostomy) or nonoperative (e.g., radiologic or endoscopic stenting or balloon dilation) procedures. When used as initial therapy or after a primary ductal repair, stents (with or without balloon dilation) resolved 100% of simple cystic duct leaks and 91% of leaks and/or strictures. In conclusion, the peak incidence of LC-related biliary injuries appears to have passed. A completed and correctly interpreted IOC increases the chance of detection of biliary injuries intraoperatively and should assist surgeons who use routine IOC. Nonsurgical techniques allow treatment of most simple cystic duct leaks, major ductal leaks and/or strictures, and postoperative BEB strictures, although follow-up is limited. The poor results of pre-referral BEB is not surprising since all of these patients were selected for referral because their treatments had not been successful."
CD009323,0,8163109,0,Endoscopic treatment of biliary injury in the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"During a 2-year period in which the application of laparoscopic cholecystectomy became widespread in the Pacific Northwest, 33 patients with surgically related bile duct injury were seen by the gastroenterology section of a large multi-specialty clinic. Twenty-nine of these patients had anatomy amenable to endoscopic approach, and 25 of the 29 are symptom-free, with normal ultrasonography and serum liver function tests, at a minimum of 1 year of follow-up after undergoing a variety of endotherapeutic procedures. The authors conclude that endoscopic therapy, in conjunction with percutaneous drainage of large bilomas, is effective treatment for cystic duct leak and minor damage to the common bile duct. Further data and prolonged follow-up are required in patients with more significant biliary injury who undergo endoscopic endoprosthesis and/or dilation therapy."
CD009323,0,8153866,0,Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy in the porcine model.,"Our aim was to assess the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy in an animate model. After developing the technique in acute animal experiments, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was performed in five young domestic pigs. Five trocars were used (2-10 mm, 2-12 mm, 1-11 mm) for video laparoscopic access to the peritoneal cavity. The operations were performed without complication in 62-95 min (mean +/- SEM, 77 +/- 7 min). Each animal tolerated oral feedings on the first postoperative day and subsequently gained 6-11 kg (10 +/- 2 kg) in the 4-7-week interval prior to sacrifice. Although there was a significant increase in serum amylase on the first postoperative day, this was associated with a comparable increase in hematocrit, possibly representing hemoconcentration. The weight of the laparoscopically resected pancreatic segment ranged from 16 to 36 g (19 +/- 2 g) while that of the pancreatic head at sacrifice was 13-29 g (21 +/- 3 g). At the time of sacrifice, there were few intraabdominal adhesions and no evidence of fluid collection or pancreatitis. The staple line across the body of the pancreas was grossly intact in all animals. We conclude that laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy in the porcine model is feasible and safe. It may therefore be possible to perform laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy in humans."
CD009323,0,8153861,0,Training in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Quantifying the learning curve.,"There is no clear consensus on the best way to train general surgeons to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). We attempted to quantify the ""learning curve"" for 86 surgeons attending eight consecutive 3-day, three-pig courses in LC. Each step of the operation was scored by the instructor for successful performance: Uncomplicated pneumoperitoneum (p), cystic duct and artery dissection (cd), artery and duct clipping (cc), operative cholangiography (oc), gallbladder dissection without holes (gd), liver bed hemostasis (h), gallbladder removal in one piece (i), and no abdominal organ injury (in). As well, operative time, method of dissection, and contact Nd: YAG or electrocautery were recorded. The percentage of students successfully completing each task for the first and third pigs on which they acted as surgeon was as follows: [table: see text] The operative time for the first and third pigs was 1.3 +/- 0.56 and 0.70 +/- 0.34 (mean +/- SD) h, respectively (P < 0.01). When students were trained with the contact Nd: YAG laser there was more blood loss than with electrosurgery (P < 0.001). Statistically significant improvement could only be demonstrated in the most difficult task, gallbladder dissection without perforation, but that task had not been mastered by the end of 3 days. The flat portion of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy ""training curve"" had not been reached by the end of the program."
CD009323,0,8153858,0,Laparoscopic-assisted colon resection.,"The popularity and success of laparoscopic biliary tract surgery have persuaded surgeons to explore other applications for rigid endoscopic surgery. From July 1990 to February 1993 a total of 65 patients (mean age 57 years; range 41-82) underwent attempted laparoscopic colon resection. Indications for surgical intervention included cancer (39), adenomatous polyps (14), diverticulosis (10), stricture (1), and foreign-body perforation (1). A laparoscopic-assisted technique whereby the specimen was removed and the anastomosis was completed outside of the abdomen was used in all patients. A dilated umbilical opening was used for right-sided lesions and a left-lower-quadrant muscle-splitting incision for descending and sigmoid colon resections. Two patients required conversion to open laparotomy. There were no deaths and only four complications (pneumonia 1, urinary tract infection 1, prolonged ileus 1, and subfascial abscess 1). The mean postoperative stay was 4.4 days (range 3-8 days) and the average interval for return to normal activity was 8 days. Laparoscopic-assisted colon resection appears to be a safe and beneficial option for many patients with pathologic disorders of the large intestine. Future clinical trials are needed to fully determine the appropriateness of this procedure in patients with localized malignancies."
CD009323,0,8128010,0,[Imaging technics in the indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Echotomography and cholangiography compared].,"March 1991 through October 1992, in the Clinica Chirurgica II of the Bologna University, 59 patients were submitted to laparoscopic cholecystectomy; the age range was 25 to 76 years and the mean 50 years. In no patient stones bigger than 35 mm were observed and 31% of the subjects were treated with litholysis before surgery. Fifty-eight patients were affected with single or multiple cholelithiasis, 1 had adenomyomatosis and 4 patients had associated choledocholithiasis treated with preoperative ERCP. Both US and cholangiography were performed to detect absolute contraindications--e.g., acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, peritonitis and cirrhosis--or relative contraindications--e.g., choledocholithiasis, > 5 mm stones and short cystic duct. US proved to be more sensitive than cholangiography to assess the number of stones and gallbladder wall thickness and to diagnose acute cholecystitis or scleroatrophic gallbladder, but it appeared to be less reliable in case of choledocholithiasis, where cholangiography was the technique of choice, and in possible anatomical variations--e.g., short cystic duct--which must be detected before laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Cholangiography appeared to be rather inadequate to study cholelithiasis when associated with functional gallbladder exclusion (as it happened in 17% of our patients). Intraoperative cholangiography was performed on 2 patients only, because their obesity hindered the preoperative study. In conclusion, the need is stressed of combining US and cholangiography for the accurate preoperative evaluation of gallbladder stones patients."
CD009323,0,8054809,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a report of 409 consecutive cases and its future outlook.,"A retrospective study was conducted on 409 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy at Teikyo University Hospital between May, 1990 and October, 1992. The operation had to be converted to an open cholecystectomy in ten of these patients because of uncontrollable bleeding from the cystic artery in one, venous bleeding due to portal hypertension in one, extensive adhesions of the omentum and the duodenum to the gallbladder in two, extensive adhesions around the gallbladder in four, and extensive adhesions between the gallbladder and the common bile duct (CBD) in two. The time taken to complete the procedure ranged from 30 to 235 min, the average time being 81 min, and the postoperative hospital stay ranged from 3 to 56 days, the average stay being 6.5 days. Eleven patients developed complications intra- or postoperatively: bile duct injury which became manifest after the operation and required laparotomy in three patients; injury to the right hemidiaphragm resulting in a right pneumothorax in one; periumbilical subcutaneous emphysema in one; mild bile leaks which resolved in a few days in two; and a severe bile leak which resolved after 6 days in one. The indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy have widened with experience and now, CBD stones and a history of previous gastrectomy are no longer contraindications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Thus, it seems that laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed as safely as a standard cholecystectomy, provided the patients are selected properly and appropriate caution is exercised."
CD009323,0,7954982,1,[Prediction of resectability and of surgical risk in pancreatic carcinoma; conditioning factors of survival after resective intervention].,"Pancreatic cancer has been extensively researched in recent years, but overall survival after diagnosis is almost unchanged since the time of Whipple. In the meantime, we have tried to determine the factors influencing surgical risk, resectability and survival. Between 1968 and 1992, 516 patients with pancreatic cancer were monitored; 160 patients with cancer of the body-tail were excluded. Eighty-five of the remaining 356 patients with pancreatic head cancer were resected, while the remainder underwent only palliative procedures. Surgical outcome, in terms of operative mortality or complications, was correctly predicted preoperatively in > 80% of patients. The preoperative evaluation of the resectability of pancreatic cancer has been investigated with different, mainly invasive, procedures. CT scan, associated with angiography and laparoscopy is reported to give better results, with a resectability rate up to 78%. 67% of our patients who were diagnosed as resectable according to CT-scan features and serum CA 19-9 < 200 U/ml, were actually resected; furthermore 40% had a potentially curative resection. Most of our 'curative' resections (80%) were within this group of patients. Multivariate analysis showed only 4 factors influencing long-term survival: TNM stage, diabetes, age > 70 years, tumour grading."
CD009323,0,7954981,1,[The role of laparoscopy and peritoneal cytology in the preoperative staging of pancreatic carcinoma].,"The staging of pancreatic cancer still represents a challenge for surgeons involved in this field; radiological diagnostic methods used routinely (CT, NMR, angiography) may under-estimate this neoplasm; in fact, the presence of peritoneal or subglissonian hepatic micrometastasis (< 2 cm) is a frequent surprise at laparotomy and force the surgeon to undertake a palliative procedure. This policy need not be followed because it is possible to perform non-surgical palliation of jaundice or pain respectively by percutaneous radiological stent insertion and coeliac alcoholisation. Pre-operative staging thus acquires an important role in the correct treatment, surgical or medical. Laparoscopy allows us to overcome the understaging of the more common diagnostic methods and view directly the coelomatic space and the surface of the abdominal viscera; moreover during this procedure it is possible to perform a peritoneal wash to obtain other information on the cancer stage. We judged 56 patients by radiological diagnosis; 31 were excluded from surgery by laparoscopy; 10 of the other 25 cases were submitted to radical resection. The resectability operative rate was 40%, compared with 18% if we had submitted patients to surgery. Several patients underwent peritoneal wash, always with negative results; all were submitted to surgery and radically resected. In our opinion, laparoscopy and peritoneal wash represent useful tools in the staging of patients affected with pancreatic cancer."

Histopathological diagnosis of the resected cyst wall and direct observation of the inner surface of the remaining cyst wall confirmed that they were benign biliary cysts. The laparoscopic deroofing of liver cysts is therefore not only an effective means of treatment, but it also facilitates the establishment of an exact differential diagnosis."

Evolution from an experimental technique to a standardized surgical procedure.,"Between October 1991 and November 1992, 51 patients in the mean age 63.2 years (range 19 to 91 years) underwent laparoscopic colon resection. Indications for surgery were colon carcinoma (31), adenomatous polyps (8), diverticulitis (10) and Crohn's disease (2). In right-sided lesions an extracorporeal anastomosis and in left-sided lesions an intracorporeal anastomosis was performed using the double stapling technique. The mortality rate was 1.9% and the morbidity rate 20.5% in the laparoscopic-treated group. The conversion rate was 13.7%. Except for one anastomotic leakage in a converted patient, no anastomotic problems were encountered. The percentage of infectious complications was 11.7%. Three reinterventions were necessary for treatment of two deep subfascial abscesses and one case of localized peritonitis, caused by a small small bowel injury. The mean hospital stay was 9.1 days (range 4-29 days). In the last 13 consecutive patients, except for a urinary infection, no further post-operative morbidity was encountered. Laparoscopic-assisted colon resection has evolved in to a standardized surgical technique. Initial learning problems are solved by good patient selection, better operative logistics and awareness of the dangers and pitfalls of laparoscopic surgery."
CD009323,0,7845162,0,[Jejunal small intestine duplication].,"Duplications of the alimentary tract are rare. Most of them are diagnosed during infancy or childhood, when they become symptomatic and a palpable mass is found. Major complications are bleeding, perforation, ileus and pancreatitis. In the majority of cases the gastro-intestinal duplication is localized in the small bowel. Correct preoperative diagnosis by means of imaging techniques is rare. Because there is no malignancy surgery is only necessary in symptomatic cases."
CD009323,0,7836794,0,[Small bowel obstruction at the site of introduction of the trocar: an unusual complication of laparoscopy].,"A 65 year old healthy female developed a small bowel obstruction after laparoscopic unroofing of a large, symptomatic, right renal cyst. After failure of conservative management, exploratory laparotomy revealed a very localized herniation of small intestine at a trocar site as suggested by CT scan. The hernia was reduced at the time of laparotomy and no bowel resection was necessary. The patient had an uneventful recovery. Although uncommon, bowel herniation at the site of trocar insertion should be recognized as part of the possible morbidity of laparoscopic surgery. The mechanism of development of such a complication and possible preventive measures are reviewed. A ""preventive"" fascial closure technique is suggested."
CD009323,0,7825319,0,[Pancreatic carcinoma--diagnosis and screening--endoscopic therapy].,"Diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma is nowadays established by means of transabdominal sonography and computed tomography. In cases remaining unclear or accompanied by obstructive jaundice ERCP is also required. Small tumours can only be detected by ERCP or endosonography with sufficient accuracy. Biopsy (percutaneous or ductal during ERCP) should be restricted to cases in which the histologic or cytologic results influence therapeutic concepts substantially. Magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopy of the pancreatic duct are currently being evaluated. Tumor markers such as CA 19-9 are mostly useful in confirming suspicious morphology; their specificity and the sensitivity in small tumours are unsatisfactory. Precise pretherapeutic staging with computed tomography, endosonography, and laparoscopy can avoid superfluous surgical procedures. Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer appears possible at present only by means of ERCP or endosonography, but patients at risk still have to be defined since blind screening would be ineffective due to insufficient specificity, expensive and dangerous due to the complications of the applied methods. In the patient with obstructive jaundice unfit for surgery, or with metastatic spread of the disease, endoscopic stent insertion is the palliative treatment of choice. Because of longer patency metal stents are superior to plastic endoprotheses."
CD009323,0,7733588,0,[Complications of celioscopic cholecystectomy in 2006 patients].,"The development of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is only justified if it can ensure the good results obtained by laparotomy. The purpose of this work is to study all complications which occurred in a homogeneous group of patients. From May 1988 to January 1993, we operated on 2006 patients by laparoscopy (724 men and 1282 women) with a mean age of 50.6 years. Signs of stones in the common bile duct were noted in 4.1% and acute cholecystitis was detected in 12.5%. A conversion to normal laparotomy was necessary in 2.1% of patients. All complications were systematically investigated restrospectively in any patient hospitalised for more than five days. Residual stones in the common bile duct were not taken into consideration when they were not complications obviously related to the operation. We observed five intraoperative complications (4 hemorrhages, 1 ileum puncture) and 40 postoperative complications (25 non biliary and 15 biliary). The 25 non biliary complications consisted of: 1 death by pulmonary embolism, 9 hemorrhages, 4 cases of acute pancreatitis, 4 subphrenic abscesses, 2 colon punctures, 2 parietal complications, 1 ulcer perforation, 1 myocardial infarction and 1 phlebitis. The 15 biliary complications consisted of: 3 lateral punctures of the common bile duct, 9 fistulas of the cystic duct (4 with a residual stone in the common bile duct and 5 without), 2 punctures of an abnormal right hepatic duct, one of which was treated by ""Roux en Y loop"" intestinal diversion, and a late stenosis of the common bile duct.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009323,0,7701905,0,Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: before and after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"In 39 patients with indication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), an endoscopic cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed before the procedure whenever intermittent cholestasis, acute pancreatitis or ultrasonografic biliary tract dilatation were detected. No abnormality was found in 24 of them. In 14, bile duct stones were removed by endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST). Later they were submitted to LC, and no complication was observed. Only 1 patient with cholangiografic diagnosis of Mirizzi's syndrome underwent open cholecystectomy. Twenty-four patients were referred to ERCP between 2 and 210 days following LC, after development of complications. The etiology of these complications could be established in all the cases. Sixteen patients had bile duct stones, 14 of them were treated successfully by EST and 2, with multiple stones, required open surgery extraction. Four patients had cystic bile leaks, of which 1 healed spontaneously, 1 closed his fistula after EST and removal of stones, 1 cured after a nasobiliary tube was inserted endoscopically and 1 required surgical treatment. Four patients with complete obstruction of common bile duct by misplaced clips received surgical treatment. We conclude that ERCP is indicated before LC in patients with clinical, humoral or ultrasound findings of extrahepatic cholestasis. The application of EST plus LC systematically in cases of biliary duct stones remains still controversial. We agree that ERCP is an excellent method in the diagnosis and treatment of LC complications."

Surgery which was thought to be curative all too frequently proves to be simply a palliative procedure. The risk of failure is so high that a strategy should now be systematically adopted, combining surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and symptomatic treatments. The rigor of this multidisciplinary approach is based on comparative studies confirming the prospective series and measuring the quality and duration of survival. Some protocols provide considerable improvement, for example preoperative radiotherapy of cancers of the rectum, or propose an interesting alternative such as the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in cancer of the oesophagus. The participation of surgeons in multicentre prospective studies should validate and improve current oncological practice while also evaluating the contribution of a new method such as laparoscopic surgery. This commitment includes a definition of therapeutic objectives, definition of the reference treatment, selection of the criteria of the quality of the procedures involved in this treatment and objective assessment of the results."
CD009323,0,8308808,0,The influence of diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy on patients presenting with an acute abdomen.,"The role of laparoscopy in the management of patients presenting to one surgical firm with an acute abdomen is discussed. Sixty-seven laparoscopies have been performed over an 18 month period and it has altered the diagnosis in 19.4% of cases and the management in 13.4% of cases. At laparoscopy the diagnosis of appendicitis was made in 37 patients (81% had attempted laparoscopic appendicectomies); pelvic inflammatory disease in 15 patients; torted fimbrial cyst in two patients; and free pus in the right lower peritoneum as a result of a perforated appendix was seen in two patients. Normal laparoscopy was performed in five patients and four patients who presented with a perforated duodenal ulcer had the diagnosis confirmed at laparoscopy, in three cases the perforation was oversewn laparoscopically. Two laparoscopies were performed on trauma patients; one stabbing and one blunt trauma to the right hypochondrium. It has been demonstrated that diagnostic laparoscopy is a useful adjunct to the general surgeon's armamentarium. It is suggested that the skill of laparoscopy is passed on to junior trainee surgeons who can use this technique to help attain a diagnosis in patients presenting with an acute abdomen."
CD009323,0,8298933,0,Bile duct injury and bile leakage in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Between January 1991 and July 1992, 350 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed. There were six biliary complications (1.7 per cent): common bile duct (CBD) injury (one patient), delayed CBD necrosis (one), immediate postoperative bile leakage (one) and delayed bile leakage (three). All six patients required laparotomy. Primary repair with long-arm T tube splinting for 3 months was performed for the CBD injury. Religation of the cystic duct was carried out after immediate postoperative bile leakage. Laparotomy with T tube choledochostomy only was performed in the three patients with delayed bile leakage, and hepatojejunostomy Roux-en-Y was undertaken for CBD necrosis. The patient with primary repair of the CBD injury required choledochojejunostomy Roux-en-Y 18 months later for stenosis. Episodes of intermittent cholangitis occurred in the patient with CBD necrosis. The outcome for the four patients with bile leakage was good. There were no deaths."
CD009323,0,8298929,1,Laparoscopic ultrasonography for hepatobiliary and pancreatic malignancy.,"Despite the advances made since the introduction of ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, a wide discrepancy may occur between preoperative and peroperative staging of gastrointestinal malignancy with liver and peritoneal metastases. Diagnostic laparoscopy performed immediately before a planned laparotomy can provide valuable information for the accurate assessment and appropriate management of some forms of gastrointestinal malignancy, especially that of the liver and pancreas. For evaluation of small liver and retroperitoneal malignancies, intraoperative ultrasonography performed by laparotomy is of proven value. It is now technically possible to perform ultrasonography through a laparoscopic cannula using high-resolution ultrasonographic transducers. This combination of laparoscopy and ultrasonography was studied in 25 patients with established liver lesions, carcinoma of the gallbladder or pancreatic cancer. Additional information leading to a change in surgical approach was obtained in 20 patients. Laparoscopic ultrasonography, although still in a preliminary phase of development, is a simple and reliable technique that will contribute to more accurate staging of intra-abdominal malignancy."
CD009323,0,8269271,0,Migration and slipping of metal clips after celioscopic cholecystectomy.,"Most surgeons performing in laparoscopic cholecystectomy have opted for the use of metal clips to secure the cystic duct before division. Accordingly, we have been using double proximal clipping of the cystic duct for our patients. Certain disadvantages of clips are well known, among them, their ability to slip. We report one case of clip migration into the common bile duct, which led to obstructive jaundice. The clip was recovered after endoscopic sphincterotomy. Slipping of the second metal clip lead to biliary peritonitis necessitating surgical drainage. The case presented raises the question of whether suture ligation of the proximal end of the cystic duct should be preferred to clipping."
CD009323,0,8261824,0,Relationship between cystic duct diameter and the presence of cholelithiasis.,"We sought to measure cystic duct diameter in patients without biliary calculi and in those with cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis. Using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), we visualized the cystic duct in 168 patients referred to our unit. These patients were distributed into three groups based on findings at ERCP: Group I (N = 57), no calculi in the gallbladder or common bile duct; group II (N = 27), stones found in the gallbladder but absent from the common bile duct; and group III (N = 34), stones present in the common bile duct with or without gallbladder stones. The diameter of the cystic duct was measured at its widest and narrowest dimensions. The largest diameter measured was greater in group III (7.72 +/- 2.29 mm) than in groups I (2.63 +/- 0.67 mm) and II (4.59 +/- 1.13 mm) (P < 0.001). The same differences were found in measurement of the smallest diameter (5.00 +/- 0.99 mm, 3.10 +/- 0.62 mm, and 1.83 +/- 0.53 mm, for groups III, II, and I, respectively) (P < 0.001). Maximal and minimal cystic duct diameter show a progressive increase at each level of disease. This increase in cystic duct size may facilitate the migration of gallstone fragments after lithotripsy and facilitate the instrumentation of the cystic duct during ERCP and laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,8249981,0,Cystic duct anatomy: an endoscopic perspective.,"Knowledge of the junction of the cystic and common hepatic duct is essential for endoscopic management of biliary tract disease. The cystic and common hepatic ducts were evaluated retrospectively in cholangiograms obtained for a variety of indications in 524 persons. The cysticohepatic junction was adequately visualized in 70%. Medial junctions were noted in 18% and a spiral configuration in 32%, both more common than reported. An 11% occurrence of parallel duct systems was less frequent than expected. In 10% of patients, the cystic duct entered the hepatic duct in the distal third of the extrahepatic biliary tree. The importance of understanding this anatomy is illustrated with selected cases of therapeutic biliary endoscopy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy complications. Suggestions are made for improving performance in this area."

CD009323,0,8118081,0,"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and laparoscopic cholecystectomy: stones, stents and sphincterotomy.","Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is clearly a useful adjunct in the management of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy who have common bile duct stones. Whether endoscopic sphincterotomy plus laparoscopic cholecystectomy is superior to traditional open cholecystectomy and bile duct exploration is a question which remains to be answered by prospective, randomized trials. The immense popularity of laparoscopic cholecystectomy may prohibit such a study in the USA. In expert hands, endoscopic stone extraction is usually successful, so ERCP can be deferred until after cholecystectomy unless there is serious suspicion of a duct stone preoperatively. Actual clinical practice will depend, however, on the skill of the surgeon, the skill of the endoscopist, and the commitment to removing the gallbladder laparoscopically. It would seem prudent for surgeons to continue to direct their energy toward conquering the common bile duct via the laparoscope, and leave ERCP and stone extraction in the realm of the endoscopist who has been extensively trained in this difficult technique. Proficiency at ERCP, sphincterotomy and stone extraction requires considerable training, and the procedure should not be attempted by individuals who have performed fewer than 100 ERCPs and 25 individually supervised sphincterotomies, according to the ASGE Standards of Training, 1992. As experience with video endoscopic surgery increases and technology improves, it will become possible to remove most duct stones at the time of cholecystectomy, thus obviating the need for endoscopic sphincterotomy. In addition, ERCP should be regarded as the treatment of choice for postoperative cystic duct stump leaks. Studies have shown that any type of biliary decompression, i.e. sphincterotomy, stents or nasobiliary catheters, will be successful. The authors recommend that, in the absence of duct stones, stenting or nasobiliary catheters be used as they are less invasive. Bile duct leaks may also be managed endoscopically, but success depends on the individual characteristics of the duct injury. The decision to manage late onset strictures endoscopically should be individualized, and consideration of local endoscopic expertise, operative risk, interval between surgery and stricture, and the patient's wishes should be made."

Although experience to date with these procedures is limited, they hold the promise of being a viable alternative for patients refractory to medical therapy or for those non-complaint with long-term maintenance pharmacologic treatment. Simple closure of an acute perforated ulcer has also been accomplished laparoscopically. In performing laparoscopic surgical procedures for duodenal ulcer disease, the relief of symptoms appears similar to that reported following comparable open procedures but with the advantages of diminished postoperative pain and disability.

CD009323,0,7513830,0,[Palliative treatment of pancreatic carcinoma. Comparison between 2 successive observation periods].,"Explorative laparotomies and palliative surgery for pancreatic carcinoma have been reduced due to improved diagnostic tools, the spread of laparoscopic techniques and the growing use of external biliary drainage and endoprostheses. By comparing two successive observation periods the authors point out that, owing to the good results obtained, mini-invasive surgery is more frequently used in the management of obstructive jaundice than biliodigestive surgical derivations. Of these, hepatico-jejunostomy is preferable to duodenal anastomosis due to the latter's frequent involvement by the primary tumour. The authors also consider it inappropriate to increase operative morbidity through the systematic association of gastroenteric with biliodigestive derivation, except in cases of symptomatic or radiologically or endoscopically ascertained duodenal stenosis and when the objective finding of visceral involvement leads to the supposition of its imminent obliteration. The indications for surgical splannicectomy have also been reduced with the spread of percutaneous alcoholization of the celiac plexy in cases which resist analgesic treatment using a parenteral route."
CD009323,0,8257893,0,Advanced techniques in abdominal surgery.,"Almost every abdominal organ is now amenable to laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic appendicectomy is a routine procedure which also permits identification of other conditions initially confused with an inflamed appendix. However, assessment of appendiceal inflammation is more difficult. Almost all colonic procedures can be performed laparoscopically, at least partly, though resection for colonic cancer is still controversial. For simple patch repair of perforated duodenal ulcers laparoscopy is ideal, and inguinal groin hernia can be repaired satisfactorily with a patch of synthetic mesh. Many upper abdominal procedures, however, still take more time than the open operations. These techniques reduce postoperative pain and the incidence of wound infections and allow a much earlier return to normal activity compared with open surgery. They have also brought new disciplines: surgeons must learn different hand-eye coordination, meticulous haemostasis is needed to maintain picture quality, and delivery of specimens may be problematic. The widespread introduction of laparoscopic techniques has emphasised the need for adequate training (operations that were straight-forward open procedures may require considerable laparoscopic expertise) and has raised questions about trainee surgeons acquiring adequate experience of open procedures."
CD009323,0,8411444,0,Small bowel obstruction following laparoscopic lymphadenectomy.,We report 2 cases of small bowel obstruction following staging laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate adenocarcinoma. Short segments of ileum became incarcerated in the right lower abdominal trocar sites (10 mm.) in both patients.

One month after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, hepatobiliary scintigraphy was performed with 99mTc-Sn-N-pyridoxyl-5-methyltryptophan (PMT) to evaluate the presence of a bile leak and/or other complication. A biliary extravasation was noted in the left upper quadrant within 60 minutes. At five hours post injection, a progressive accumulation of 99mTc-PMT was noted in the lesser sac, the right and left paracolic gutter and in the pouch of Douglas.

CD009323,0,8286095,0,Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. A clinicopathological study of 20 cases and review of the literature.,"Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is a focal or diffuse destructive inflammatory process of the gall bladder, characterized macroscopically by yellowish tumour-like masses in the wall of the gall bladder. Microscopically, it is characterized in the early stages by a large number of foamy histiocytes and acute inflammatory cells. Later stages demonstrate increasing fibrosis. The gall bladder from 20 of 352 consecutive patients subjected to cholecystectomy showed XGC. Gall stones were found in the gall bladder of all 20 patients and in the ductus choledochus in 3 cases. Perforation of the gall bladder was observed at operation in six cases; in one case there was also a fistula to the colon. A perivesical abscess was found in five other cases. Adhesions to the surrounding structures were seen in a total of 16 cases. Pathogenetically, XGC is probably due to an interplay between obstruction of the gall flow, infection with subsequent inflammation, and leakage of gall fluid to the tissue, where histiocytes accumulate and phagocytize the bile pigment, haemosiderin and cholesterol, resulting in the formation of xanthoma cells. The correct diagnosis of XGC is important for several reasons, first and foremost due to the high frequency of complications, but not least because the condition may give rise peroperatively to the suspicion of malignancy. The new laparoscopic method for cholecystectomies further stresses the necessity of correct preoperative diagnosis of complicating disease."

Basing their comments on the French school, the authors review the literature to identify those innovations introduced by individual operators in elation to the original technique which have enabled this method to be extended to those cases complicated by acute cholecystitis, VBP calculosis or sequelae from abdominal surgery. The most important innovations include the use of a laparoscope with oblique 30-degrees vision, which is extremely useful during the dissection of Calot's triangle since it allows VBP to be identified with greater ease and precision, above all in the event of phlogistic sequelae enclosing the peduncle. In addition, laparoscopic suture or ligation using Roeder's running-knot, used by the Dundee school to treat the cystic duct and artery, presents considerable advantages compared to the conventional use of metal clips. The authors also emphasise the growing return to intraoperative cholangiography which is routinely performed by some authors and is of value in identifying anatomic anomalies, iatrogenic lesions and VBP calculi unnoticed by preoperative tests. A second innovation which is highlighted consists of the treatment of choledocholithiasis during the course of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, in addition to pre- and postoperative endoscopic papillo-sphincterotomy."

Our experience].,"This study analysed 90 cases of symptomatic cholelithiasis treated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 27% of the cases studied suffered from microlithiasis, 44% from multiple calculosis with calculi measuring 1 to 2 cm in diameter, 25% from single calculi measuring up to 4 cm in diameter, and 4% from a benign proliferative pathology of the cholecystic wall. Calculosis of the main biliary tract was also found in 3 patients and was treated by preoperative endoscopic papillosphincterotomy. In addition to routine tests and ultrasonography, endovenous cholangiography, or retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) in cases of suspected calculosis of the biliary tract, was always performed prior to surgery. Mean operating time was 60 min. Two procedures were converted into laparotomy due to laceration of the cystic artery. In one case laparotomy was performed on day two due to choleperitoneum following a lesion of the cystic duct. Pneumoperitoneum could not be performed in three cases. Mean hospital stay was 48 hours. No other intra- or postoperative complications were reported. These results support the opinion that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe method, with few limitations and represents the treatment of choice in the therapy of symptomatic cholelithiasis."

CD009323,0,8295388,0,[Choice of bile-diverting operations in neoplastic obstruction of the distal common bile duct].,"Analysis of clinical material of 206 patients with tumor obstruction of the distal part of the common bile duct allowed the conclusion to be made on the expediency of applying endoscopic methods for jaundice correction as the first stage in preparation for the operation (122 patients) and also as the only and final operation (70 patients). Study of the immediate and late-term results of different variants of operations for bile diversion in obstruction of the distal choledochus (203 operations) showed the superiority of the Roux hepaticoejunoanastomosis in which recurrent jaundice due to obstruction of the cystic duct does not occur, as is encountered in creation of a cholecystoejunoanastomosis, and there are no conditions for the development of ascending cholangitis."
CD009323,0,8273459,0,Common bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Bile duct injury can occur more frequently during laparoscopic cholecystectomy than in open cholecystectomy. Three cases of common bile or hepatic duct injuries occurred in a series of eighty laparoscopic cholecystectomies; In case 1, the common bile duct was misidentified as the cystic duct. In case 2, bile peritonitis occurred on the fourth postoperative day caused by necrosis of the common hepatic duct involving the cautery surrounding it. In case 3, a bile leak occurred due to an incision at the confluence of the cystic and common duct. Dissection of the cystic duct at the infundibulum of the gallbladder, blunt dissection of the Calot's triangle, the handling of clips with special attention for safety were thought to be necessary in order to lower the risk of bile duct injury. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) is recommended to avoid bile duct injury."
CD009323,0,8270231,0,Peritoneal metastases in pancreatic carcinoma.,"Peritoneal metastases are present in about 50% of patients with pancreatic cancer at the time of death, and are the second most common site of involvement, following the liver. The small size of peritoneal metastases precludes their identification by CT scan, and thus they have to be identified by direct visualization, either at laparotomy or through laparoscopy. Adding laparoscopy to the staging protocol permits pre-operative identification of patients who will not benefit from surgery. Malignant cells are also found within the peritoneal cavity in 20 to 30% of patients with pancreatic cancer who otherwise have no peritoneal or liver metastases. Their presence, documented by peritoneal washings during laparoscopy or at the time of surgery, seems to be associated with an adverse prognosis."
CD009323,0,8261267,0,Technique of laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy with a Roux-en-Y loop.,"In order to avoid laparotomy in patients with biliary obstruction due to inoperable carcinoma of the pancreatic head, we evaluated the feasibility of a bypass operation using minimal invasive measures. A technique of laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy was tested in adult pigs who had undergone clip occlusion of the distal common bile duct to imitate choledochal obstruction. Complete biliary bypass was restored with a cholecystojejunostomy via a Roux-en-Y loop using two circular staplers (21, 25, or 29 mm diameter), introduced through a prototype 33-mm-diameter trocar, used to effect the proximal and distal anastomoses. Seven pigs operated on in this way recovered easily, with normal weight gain and without technical complications. Contrast radiography of the biliary bypass at autopsy on day 28 confirmed patent and leak-free anastomoses and functional bypass. We conclude that laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy with a Roux-en-Y loop is a feasible technique and results in an uncomplicated postoperative course and a biliary bypass with optimal function. Endoscopic application of circular staplers for laparoscopic enterobiliary and enteroenteral anastomosis is practical and safe."
CD009323,0,8257630,0,Cholescintigraphy in the diagnosis of the complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Cholescintigraphy has been used to diagnose postoperative bile leaks and obstructions after open cholecystectomy. This imaging technique has been found to be sensitive for detecting bile leaks that arise from cholecystectomy and defects in the filling and emptying of bile ducts. These observations can be applied to patients who are suspected of having bile duct injury after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Cholescintigraphy can detect a variety of bile leaks including those arising from the gallbladder fossa, cystic duct, and the common bile duct. In addition, cholescintigraphy can be used for management of patients after stenting or bypass surgery, to assess bile flow and operative sites for any residual bile leaks. Postoperative bile duct obstructions can also be seen with cholescintigraphy. In this article we discuss a comprehensive postoperative strategy for the management and diagnosis of biliary defects after laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholescintigraphy."
CD009323,0,8256477,0,A combined biopsy-plugging device based on the Menghini- or Trucut needle for percutaneous liver biopsy: clinical experience.,"Impaired blood clotting precludes percutaneous liver biopsy for histologic examination of liver tissue. The transjugular or laparoscopic approach are ways to reduce the risk of bleeding. These techniques, however, are laborious and confined to specialized centers. Methods of plugging the needle track with sealant presented so far are hampered by the need to leave either the cannula in situ or the need for a second percutaneous approach for the application of the sealant. We have tested a combined plugging-biopsy device allowing to perform the biopsy as a one-step procedure in patients with impaired clotting under laparoscopic vision control. In 37 patients either a modified Trucut or Menghini needle was tested. Handling of the Trucut needle proved easier. Tissue yield was satisfactory with both needles. Only one episode of bleeding was observed with a prototype Menghini needle. We conclude, that the combined plugging-biopsy device is a safe and reliable tool for obtaining liver tissue in patients with impaired blood coagulation."
CD009323,0,8251670,0,An unusual case of a retained stone following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"A patient with gallstone pancreatitis was managed by endoscopic sphincterotomy followed by a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. At the time of surgery, an intraoperative cholangiogram disclosed the presence of a residual calculus, which was erroneously thought to be in the common bile duct. A repeat ERCP showed that the stone was, in fact, in a long cystic duct stump which was fortunately accessible to endoscopic extraction."
CD009323,0,8214974,0,Vascular injuries during pancreatobiliary surgery.,"Fourteen cases of vascular injury during pancreatobiliary surgery have been treated at our institution. The patients' mean age was 49 years, and nine were males. Six operations were performed for chronic pancreatitis, six for cancer, and two for an inflammatory process. Operations included 11 pancreatic resections and one laparoscopic cholecystectomy, one sphincteroplasty, and one pseudocyst drainage. Vessels injured included the portal vein (7), superior mesenteric vein (6), superior mesenteric artery (3), hepatic arteries (4), splenic vein (3). Six patients experienced more than one vascular injury. In all but one case, the injury was recognized and repaired during the initial operation. Primary repair was possible in seven cases. Six cases utilized autogenous tissue for repair. The one unrecognized injury was a right hepatic artery ligation, and a delayed repair was not possible. Follow-up demonstrated two occlusions, one following a portal vein repair without clinical sequela and a superior mesenteric artery repair which resulted in a small bowel stricture. The one unrecognized hepatic artery injury resulted in necrosis of the proximal common hepatic duct. Vascular injury following pancreatobiliary injury tends to occur in the presence of pancreatitis or cancer with its associated dense adhesions and inflammatory process. The variable anatomy of this area contributes to vascular injuries. Immediate recognition of the injury and repair appears to yield excellent results."
CD009323,0,8214966,0,Hepatic duct transection during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,A rare anatomical variation was encountered during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The right hepatic duct emptied into the infundibulum of the gallbladder. This confluence then joined the left hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. The right hepatic duct was transected between the gallbladder and the common bile duct as a normal cystic duct would have been isolated and divided laparoscopicaly. This anatomic variant was recognized after further mobilization of the gallbladder from the liver bed. A laparotomy was performed to create a right hepatic duct enteric anastomosis. The case illustrates one possible pitfall that may be encountered during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
CD009323,0,8175250,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: experience in 500 consecutive cases.,"Between April 1989 and November 1991, 500 consecutive patients (393 women and 107 men, aged 17 to 87 years) underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy at our institution. The most common indication for surgery was chronic calculous cholecystitis. Twelve (2.4%) patients underwent emergency surgery, and the rest had elective operations. The average operative time was 36 minutes. In all but 72 cases, dissection was performed with a laser. In 4 instances (0.08%), the laparoscopic procedure was converted to an open cholecystectomy because acute cholecystitis made the gallbladder hard to grasp (2 cases) or faulty insufflation equipment afforded poor visualization of the operative field (2 cases). Three patients (0.06%) underwent reoperation for posterior cystic artery bleeding, cystic duct leakage, and common-bile-duct injury (1 case each). Minor complaints during the immediate postoperative period included nausea and shoulder pain. Patients were discharged from the hospital an average of 20 hours after surgery and resumed full activity within 3 to 8 days."
CD009323,0,8050701,0,[Endoscopic sphincterotomy experience at the Cancer Control Center].,"Endoscopy Sphincterotomy is an important therapeutic procedure in the treatment of some biliary and pancreatic disorders. In this paper, we report our experience over this subject. In our patients the main indication to perform this procedure was common bile duct stones; they were 83% of the total cases. In those cases, 67% were residual stones after cholecystectomy by laparotomy and laparoscopy. We performed sphincterotomy in 33% of patients with gallbladders in situ. In five patients (7.57%), we made the diagnosis of Oddi's sphincter dysfunction taken in account clinical, biochemical an radiological findings. No manometric measurements were done. We found some unusual cases, such as: choledococele and Sump syndrome. In five patients we had complications, 3 of them bled and the other two developed edematous pancreatitis. All these complications were solved with medical treatment."
CD009323,0,8367764,0,Retrospective comparison of outcome of 100 consecutive open cholecystectomies and 100 consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies.,"If laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to be a viable option for community surgeons and their patients, it should have a safety profile similar to or better than that of open cholecystectomy. Morbidity and mortality from 100 consecutive open cholecystectomies were compared to morbidity and mortality from 100 consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies. All procedures were done at Davis Community Hospital (Statesville, NC, population 25,000). Open cholecystectomies were done by seven staff surgeons from July 1987 to March 1990. Laparoscopic cholecystectomies were done by three staff surgeons from February 1990 to August 1990. Cholangiography during open cholecystectomy was selective. After an initial learning experience of 11 cases, cholangiography was routine during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients having cholecystectomy coincidental to a planned common duct exploration for stones or neoplasia were excluded. For open cholecystectomy, morbidity was 13% and mortality, 2%. For laparoscopic cholecystectomy, morbidity was 9% and mortality, 1%. One death after open cholecystectomy was due to pulmonary embolus. The other two deaths in the series were due to underlying severe cardiopulmonary disease. Complications related directly to cholecystectomy were bleeding requiring transfusion (open 2, laparoscopic 1), bile leak (open 1, laparoscopic 1), wound infection (open 1), and prolonged back pain (laparoscopic 2). In two patients, the laparoscopic procedure was converted to open cholecystectomy. There were no common bile duct injuries in either group of patients. Results of this study suggest that laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be done as safely as open cholecystectomy, even in smaller community hospitals."
CD009323,0,8226088,0,[Cholecysto-cholangiography as an alternative to cystic duct cholangiography in laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,Intraoperative cholangiography may be an important adjunct to laparoscopic cholecystectomy in order to prevent bile duct lesions. Laparoscopic cannulation of the cystic duct can be very difficult and time consuming. We therefore developed a simple technique of cholecystocholangiography. The gallbladder is punctured and filled with contrast medium after having localised the cystic duct and put a metal clip as a landmark. The study included 52 patients having either cholecystocholangiography or cystic duct cholangiography. In 13 out of 26 patients (50%) cholecystocholangiography failed because of obstruction of the cystic duct. The cholangiograms showed complete filling of the bile ducts in 5 (19%) and incomplete visualisation in 8 cases (31%). Cystic duct cholangiography showed significantly better results with good delineation of the biliary tree in 19 cases (73%). Five cholangiograms were suboptimal (19%) and only 2 studies failed (8%). The relation between cystic duct and common bile duct was clearly visible in 24 cases (92%) with cystic duct cholangiography compared with 13 cases (50%) with cholecystocholangiography. Cystic duct cholangiography has better success rates in delineating biliary anatomy in order to prevent bile duct injury. Cholecystocholangiography is a good alternative in cases where the cystic duct cannot be initially visualized.
CD009323,0,8211613,0,Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in conjunction with laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has become the primary surgical treatment for symptomatic cholelithiasis. In conjunction with the dramatic rise in LC there has been an increase in the number of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs) performed. For this study, the records of patients referred to the surgical endoscopy department between January 1991 and February 1992 were reviewed. Seventy-seven ERCPs were performed in conjunction with LC. The indications for ERCP included jaundice or a history of jaundice, gallstone pancreatitis, a suspicious filling defect on either ultrasound or intraoperative cholangiogram, abnormal liver function tests, cholangitis, or postoperative bile leak. Sixty-two procedures were performed prior to LC and 15 procedures after LC. Forty-two patients were female (54.5%) and the patients ages ranged from 14 to 92 years (mean 54.1 years). Of the 62 patients having ERCP preoperatively 35 patients (56.5%) had no evidence of common bile duct (CBD) stones and underwent LC as planned. Twenty-three patients were found to have CBD stones, of which six were referred for an open cholecystectomy and CBD exploration, because of large multiple CBD stones or the presence of a large duodenal diverticulum. Seventeen patients had their CBD cleared endoscopically, and four patients were not successfully cannulated. Fifteen patients had ERCP after LC. There were two patients with CBD injuries who were referred for surgical correction. Two patients had leakage from the cystic duct stump, and four patients had CBD stones, all of whom were successfully treated with endoscopic sphincterotomy. There were four patients who had a normal postoperative ERCP and two patients who could not have their CBD cannulated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009323,0,7508432,0,Pancreatic ascites.,"Pancreatic ascites is rarely considered in the differential diagnosis of exudative ascites, and is in fact missed in a majority of patients. Eleven cases of pancreatic ascites are described. 63.6% were chronic alcoholics. The clinical diagnosis was cirrhosis of liver (5/11), tuberculous peritonitis (5/11) or malignant peritonitis (1/11). In all patients ascites was exudative and the ascitic fluid amylase was markedly elevated (mean +/- SD: 7815 +/- 6507 SU/dl). Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) performed in 4 patients demonstrated the site of leak in 3. Laparoscopy performed in 8 patients helped in the diagnosis of pancreatic ascites in all, which was confirmed on histology. Laparoscopy ruled out other causes of exudative ascites in all. We conclude that pancreatic ascites should be suspected in any patient with exudative ascites, especially chronic alcoholics and that ascitic fluid amylase should be routinely performed in all such cases. High ascitic fluid content is virtually diagnostic of pancreatic ascites. ERP is essential in preoperative assessment or planning endoscopic treatment. Laparoscopy is an invaluable investigation to rule out other conditions such as tuberculous or malignant peritonitis and cirrhosis of liver."
CD009323,0,8378821,0,Laparoscopic anatomy of the biliary tree.,"A thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the extrahepatic biliary tree and its frequent anatomic variations is essential for performance of a safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The surgeon should have an appreciation for the distortions in the anatomy as a result of retraction on the gallbladder and how the direction of retraction alters the spatial relationships between the cystic duct and common bile duct. The steps in the operative procedure have been outlined to provide good exposure and optimize the identification of structures. Good exposure will enable the surgeon to identify anatomic variants; however, a thorough knowledge of these variants is necessary for safe performance of the operation."
CD009323,0,8348864,0,Laparoscopic-assisted bowel surgery.,"The use of laparoscopic surgical techniques is now being applied to a variety of operations traditionally performed in an open fashion. Twenty patients underwent laparoscopic-guided large and small bowel surgery at our institution from March 1991 to April 1992. The indications for surgery included polyps, obstruction, bleeding, and perforation, and pathologic diagnoses included benign polyps, lipomas, inflammatory bowel disease, perforation of a jejunal diverticulum, colonic arteriovenous malformations, and adenocarcinoma. Mobilization of the colon, ligation of the mesentery, and closure of the mesenteric defect were performed using the laparoscopic equipment. One trocar site was enlarged to 3 cm to deliver the bowel through the abdominal wall. All anastomoses were hand-sewn. Postoperative hospitalization ranged from 2 to 31 days (median, five days). No mortality was noted, and morbidity was 20 percent. We conclude that laparoscopic-guided bowel surgery is technically feasible and should translate into shorter hospitalization and less patient discomfort."
CD009323,0,8338097,0,Agenesis of the gallbladder revisited laparoscopically.,"Gallbladder agenesis is an extremely rare disease. Necropsy incidence has been reported to be 0.016%. Failure to locate the gallbladder at the time of a planned cholecystectomy can be very challenging. We report such a case during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The indication for surgery in these patients are complaints of gallbladder symptoms along with a false-positive ultrasound study. During exploration, an abnormal location of the gallbladder has to be excluded. Ectopic gallbladder locations include intrahepatic, lesser omentum, retroperitoneal, retrohepatic, within the falciform ligament, retroduodenal, and retrohepatic areas. Thorough exploration and cholangiography are essential. Embryologically, the gallbladder and cystic duct arise from the caudal portion of the hepatic bud. All of the previously reported cases of gallbladder agenesis have shown an absence of both the gallbladder and cystic duct. We report an embryological oddity wherein a patent cystic duct was found along with an agenetic gallbladder. This is the first case report of this finding, along with this being the first absent gallbladder discovered laparoscopically."
CD009323,0,8338094,0,"Introduction of a ""safety zone"" for the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","Anatomic variations of the biliary tract were found in 18 cases of 600 patients (3.0%) undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All bile duct anomalies were confirmed preoperatively by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. In every case, the cystic duct and cystic artery were exposed in a ""safety zone"" near the gallbladder neck in Calot's triangle. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully performed on all 18 cases. Intraoperative cholangiography clearly demonstrated the anatomic variations in all cases, unequivocally identified the cystic duct, and confirmed the absence of bile duct injury. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and intraoperative cholangiography, which have been performed routinely in all patients, improve the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Moreover, the observance of the essential rule of ""keep operating in the safety zone"" protects against inadvertent complications, especially against bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was thus successfully performed on all 600 cases in the present series, except for three cases, which were converted to open surgery (conversion rates, 0.5%), because of pin-hole bleeding on the portal vein in our first case of 600, and severe adhesion in two (46th and 302nd) cases."
CD009323,0,8269246,0,Does routine cystic duct cholangiogram during laparoscopic cholecystectomy prevent common bile duct injury?,"Between November 1989 and September 1992, the author performed 1,000 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Three common bile duct injuries occurred (0.3%). Selective cystic duct cholangiograms were performed for diagnosis and management of common bile duct stones. A total of 102 cholangiograms (10%) were done. Only eight of these cholangiograms were done for anatomical verification in the face of severe chronic or acute cholecystitis. Five were cystic duct cholangiograms, resulting in two common bile duct injuries. To avoid the problem of common bile duct injury in cases of obscure anatomy where clarification was needed, a cholecystocholangiogram was done for duct identification in three subsequent cases without event. The third common bile duct injury occurred early in the learning experience without benefit of the cholangiogram."
CD009323,0,8217921,0,Biliary surgery via minilaparotomy--a limited procedure for biliary lithiasis.,"Cholelithiasis until now has been treated using solvents, lithotripsy via a biliary endoscope, laser or shock wave lithotripsy, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. I have developed a new surgical treatment for cholelithiasis in which a cholecystectomy is performed through a minilaparotomy. This paper presents this new technique and discusses the principles of surgery for cholelithiasis using this technique. This procedure is performed by a 2 to 3 cm subcostal skin incision in the right hypochondrium. More than 400 patients were treated by this technique. This procedure is not different in terms of blood loss or operation time from conventional methods, and no significant complications have occurred. Intraoperative X-ray examination is performed routinely because of easy insertion of a tube from the cystic duct into the bile duct. Reduction of the length of the incision greatly facilitates postoperative recovery, shortening the hospital length-of-stay to within 3 days. The surgical manipulation of only a limited area of the upper abdomen is unlikely to induce postoperative syndromes, such as adhesions or ileus. Following this experience, a biliary drainage procedure based on cholangionmanomery and primary closure of the choledochotomy was introduced. This approach allowed even patients with choledocholithiasis to undergo a minilaparotomy and be discharged within one week."
CD009323,0,7693934,0,Review: intraoperative ultrasonography during minimal access surgery.,"A total of 176 patients underwent intraoperative ultrasonography in the course of minimal access surgery using dedicated laparoscopic ultrasound probe. In 145 patients ultrasonography was used for screening of the biliary tract during laparoscopic cholecystectomy or laparoscopic cholecystectomy combined with common bile duct exploration. In 31 patients undergoing staging laparoscopy it was used for examination of the liver and staging of gastrointestinal malignancy. The outcome of the preliminary evaluation of this method allows the conclusion that ultrasonography during minimal access surgery has a huge potential to become a simple and reliable diagnostic tool in the future, supporting the surgeon in operative decision-making."
CD009323,0,8415340,0,Timing of intervention in acute pancreatitis.,"This review examines the appropriate timing of intervention in acute pancreatitis. In gallstone pancreatitis, it is now clear that cholecystectomy during the primary admission carries no greater risk of complications than delayed cholecystectomy and enables earlier recovery to normal activity. This course of action pre-empts a second, possibly fatal attack of acute pancreatitis. Cholecystectomy should be done after the acute phase has settled, before discharge from hospital. Patients with gallstones should now be offered endoscopic sphincterotomy within 48 hours of admission. This approach is safe, and reduces the risk of complications. When complications develop, early necrosectomy is only indicated if conservative measures fail. Delayed (> 10 days) necrosectomy is appropriate if there is evidence of sepsis, or clinical failure to improve. Pancreatic pseudocysts can often be managed expectantly; a high proportion will resolve spontaneously. After a delay of 12 weeks, persistent cysts require evaluation by endoscopic pancreatography, which gives crucial information in the choice between percutaneous or surgical drainage of the pseudocyst. A patient with pancreatitis is usually treated under the care of a surgeon, who has traditionally taken the decision on the timing of any intervention, and has performed such intervention at open operation. Recently, the development of alternative techniques has enabled the surgeon to call on the skills of his colleagues in endoscopy and interventional radiology. However, the availability of these alternatives to surgery should not affect the timing of intervention unless it can be clearly shown that such a change in timing combined with the minimally invasive technique can improve the outcome for the patient. Intervention may be required to deal with gallstones in the gallbladder or in the bile duct, to deal with, or ideally prevent, the deleterious systemic effects of pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis, or to drain a peripancreatic abscess. Peripancreatic fluid collections and pancreatic pseudocysts may also require either internal or external drainage to relieve symptoms or prevent complications."
CD009323,0,8366605,0,[Traditional open cholecystectomy].,"During the past 5 years, traditional open cholecystectomy was performed on 344 patients with gallbladder stones at our hospital. Using the data obtained, we studied the indications and results of traditional open cholecystectomy. In the cases of gallbladder stones with a history of cholecystitis, cholecystectomy was performed as a rule by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, traditional open cholecystectomy was chosen in cases which were complicated by perforation, pericholecystic abscess, internal biliary fistra, cirrhosis, or suspicious carcinoma of gallbladder. Investigation of the time of operation revealed that early operation tended to be performed easily. However, cases with gallbladder stones were often complicated with carcinoma of alimentary tracts, therefore before operation we must examine the alimentary tract. Cases in which gallbladder could not be visualized under ERCP, and those accompanied by pericholecystic abscess under US were difficult to operate on by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Thus many cases required laparotomy. Postoperative complications of open cholecystectomy were rare, it was concluded that traditional cholecystectomy is one of the most valuable procedures for the treatment of gallbladder stones."
CD009323,0,8366604,0,[Cholecystectomy followed by one inch minilaparotomy].,"A new surgical treatment for cholelithiasis was developed. This procedure is performed by a 2-3 cm subcostal skin incision in the right hypochondrium. About 400 patients were treated by this technique. This procedure is not different in terms of blood loss or operation time compared to conventional methods, and no significant complications have occurred. Intraoperative examination is performed routinely because of easy insertion of a tube from the cystic duct into the bile duct. Minimization of the length of the incision facilitates postoperative recovery greatly, shortening the hospital length-of-stay within 3 days. These principles allowed even patients with choledocholithiasis to undergo a minilaparotomy and be discharged within 1 week."
CD009323,0,8366592,0,[Diagnosis of cholelithiasis--endoscopic pancreatocholangiography].,"Endoscopic cholangiography is fundamentally evaluated as X-ray anatomy of the biliary system as well as the principal technique for endoscopic treatments that is endoscopic papillotomy and endoscopic drainage, while gallstone is routinely diagnosed by ultrasonography in medical practice. By endoscopic cholangiography, stones in the cystic duct and the common bile duct are confirmedly diagnosed in the same quality as gallbladder stones, and the anatomical information of the cystic duct, the gallbladder, and the duodenal papilla are clearly demonstrated, which are required in many therapeutic procedures for gallstones diseases including laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,8351606,0,Laparoscopy-guided intracorporeal ultrasound accurately delineates hepatobiliary anatomy.,The purpose of this study was to develop a technique and assess the ability of a laparoscopic ultrasound probe to delineate biliary antomy and to determine the presence or absence of duct stones.
CD009323,0,8351599,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis.,"Because laparoscopic cholecystectomy reduces hospitalization time and postoperative disability, it is being offered to an increasing number of patients with symptomatic gallstones. Nevertheless, acute cholecystitis is still considered by many surgeons to be a relative contraindication. Our standard approach has been to perform laparoscopy on all patients considered candidates for cholecystectomy. From June 1990 to October 1991, the authors personally performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy on 110 patients, 29 (26%) of whom had pathologically confirmed acute cholecystitis. Of these, nine had evidence of gangrene, perforation, or abscess formation. It was necessary to convert to open cholecystectomy in four (14%) patients. In each, inflammation or dense adhesions precluded the performance of a safe operation. The hepatorenal space was drained in 12 (41%) and cystic dust cholangiograms were performed selectively. The mean operating time was 108 min. There were no intraoperative complications. One patient developed a prolonged postoperative paralytic ileus and two patients were noted to have postoperative common duct stones. There were no deaths. The average postoperative stay for laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 2.6 days. We conclude that the advantages of laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be safely and effectively extended to the majority of patients with acute cholecystitis."
CD009323,0,8351598,0,Management of bile leaks following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"In a series of 650 consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies, nine bile leaks were identified (1.4%). Patients with bile leaks presented clinically at a mean of 4.9 days (range: 3-8 days) after surgery complaining of diffuse abdominal pain, ileus, and nausea. Laboratory values for complete blood counts and liver function tests were all mildly elevated. Definitive diagnosis was made on the basis of abnormal hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Management strategies included laparotomy and drain placement (n = 1), laparoscopy and drain placement (n = 3), ERCP and drainage (n = 4), and CT-guided percutaneous drainage (n = 1). When the etiology of the leakage was identified, it was most commonly either dysfunction of the cystic duct clips (n = 3) or leakage from a disrupted duct of Luschka (n = 2). The source of the remaining leaks (n = 4) was never determined. We conclude that bile leaks are an uncommon cause of morbidity following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Diagnosis can usually be made with nuclear medicine biliary tract scans and a variety of managements alternatives are successful in treating this complication."

CD009323,0,7692681,0,[Biliary diseases in the elderly: diagnosis and therapy].,"Biliary diseases in the elderly results in two major problems: gallstone disease and malignant jaundice. Ultrasonography and direct cholegraphy via the transpapillary or transhepatic route are the appropriate diagnostic methods. ""Open"" or ""minimal invasive"" laparoscopic cholecystectomy is indicated in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis requiring definitive treatment. Elderly patients will rarely be good candidates for conservative management with gallbladder stone fragmentation and/or dissolution. In patients with acute cholecystitis and gallstone ileus surgical intervention is recommended. Bile duct stones with or without gallbladder in situ are today an indication for endoscopic therapy. Most patients with malignant obstruction of the common bile duct, in whom operative resection is not advocated, may effectively be palliated by transpapillary or transhepatic stenting."
CD009323,0,8506964,0,Diagnosis and management of biliary complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the operation of choice for symptomatic cholelithiasis. However, this operation may result in serious biliary complications. Our aims were to review our experience with biliary complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and to document the mechanisms of the injuries and the techniques of managing these complications. We treated 20 patients with biliary complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Symptomatic collections of bile (bilomas) were present in five patients. One of these patients underwent operative ligation of an accessory bile duct in the gallbladder bed, whereas the others had percutaneous or endoscopic therapy. In the remaining 15 patients (of whom 13 were referred from other hospitals), injuries to the major bile ducts were managed by combined radiologic, endoscopic, and operative therapies. In 10 of these patients (67%), the mechanism of injury was the misidentification of the common bile duct as the cystic duct. In 3 of 15 patients, a noncircumferential injury to the lateral aspect of the common bile duct occurred. The Bismuth levels of the remaining bile duct injuries were type I in 3, type II in 4, type III in 3, and type IV in 2. Early outcome of therapy for these bile duct injuries has been favorable. One patient was lost to follow-up, and 2 died of nonbiliary causes, whereas 12 patients are alive and well with normal serum liver enzyme levels at 4 to 19 months postoperatively (mean: 14 months). The most common cause of major bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is mistaking the common bile duct for the cystic duct. Most bilomas can be managed successfully with noninvasive methods. Coordinated efforts by radiologists, endoscopists, and surgeons are necessary to optimize the management of patients with major bile duct injury, suggesting that patients with biliary complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be referred to specialty centers for optimal care."
CD009323,0,8506963,0,Spectrum and management of major complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the most prevalent method of treating uncomplicated, symptomatic cholelithiasis in the United States and elsewhere. As experience with this procedure grows, certain pitfalls are becoming apparent. Since October 1990, we have treated 22 patients for major injuries incurred during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, including 15 women and 7 men (range: 23 to 85 years). One patient had previous upper abdominal surgery; no other patient had any relative contraindication to laparoscopic surgery. The most frequent site of injury (19 patients) was the extrahepatic biliary tract. There was one fatal duodenal perforation. All but two patients whose injuries went unrecognized at laparoscopy were symptomatic during the immediate postoperative period. The biliary injuries included complete transection of the common hepatic or common bile duct in 10 patients, complete ductal occlusion in 3, a cystic duct stump leak in 2, and a partially retained gallbladder with a contained intraperitoneal bile leak in 2. The site and extent of biliary injuries were delineated with transhepatic or endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Reconstruction or repair of the biliary tract was accomplished with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy or cholangiojejunostomy in 11 and 1 patients, respectively, completion cholecystectomy in 2, and temporary transhepatic stenting, primary choledochocholedochostomy, and primary choledochorrhaphy over a T-tube in 1 patient each. One patient with a cystic duct stump leak was managed successfully with endoscopic sphincterotomy, whereas another required operative ligation. Laparoscopic injuries during cholecystectomy can lead to serious morbidity and mortality, thus emphasizing the need for adequate training and credentialing for surgeons and for a heightened clinical awareness of the potential complications, their long-term sequelae, and how to avoid them."
CD009323,0,8498217,0,Routine operative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: feasibility and value in 107 patients.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is becoming a popular alternative to open cholecystectomy. However, the technical aspects of this new procedure increase the risk of injuring the bile ducts. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and value of performing cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,8376164,0,[Significance of laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of cholecysto- and choledocholithiasis].,"The management of common bile duct stones during laparoscopic cholecystectomy contains some controversy. Our first aim is to detect choledocholithiasis preoperatively making use of a preoperative ultrasound and cholangiogram routinely. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy will follow a preoperative ERCP with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction in this desirable situation. Cystic duct cholangiography which should become a routine procedure during laparoscopic surgery is feasible in 90-99% and will detect unsuspected common duct stones and iatrogenic bile duct injuries with an accuracy rate of 75.4-90%. This investigation can replace the preoperative cholangiogram in future. A intraoperatively detected common bile duct stone can be managed nowadays by ERCP and sphincterotomy postoperatively or by converting the laparoscopic cholecystectomy into an open common bile duct exploration. Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration is of increasing demand but not yet a routine procedure. If choledocholithiasis will be diagnosed postoperatively, a ERCP with papillotomy will be performed as well. An inquiry among 50 members of the Swiss society of laparoscopic and thoracoscopic surgery (ALTC) with 3718 laparoscopic cholecystectomies pointed out their opinion about the management of common bile duct exploration during laparoscopic surgery in the presented paper."
CD009323,0,8246382,0,[Pancreonecrosis. Current views and perspectives].,"Generalization of data gained from the case records of patients with pancreonecrosis treated at 14 hospitals of Moscow allowed the authors to mark out typical errors in the diagnosis and therapeutic tactics which caused, to a considerable measure, mortality in 58.1 cases. From their personal experience in the treatment of such patients the authors believe it possible to improve essentially the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis by wide use of laparoscopy, ultrasonic scanning, and angiography of the pancreas for early verification of pancreonecrosis, appraisal of the condition of the extrahepatic bile ducts, and application of mildly injurious methods of treatment. Setting apart only two forms of acute pancreatitis is substantiated from the clinico-anatomical standpoint. The choice of the therapeutic tactics in pancreonecrosis should be based on the severity of the disease and the dynamics of its development during intensive therapy, rather than on the morphological diagnosis. Using the criteria of evaluation of the severity of pancreonecrosis, the authors reduced considerably the frequency of operative interventions in the early stages of the disease. Among the methods of operative treatment of pancreonecrosis, distant pancreatectomy or programmed repeated necroso-sequestrectomies are preferred."
CD009323,0,8111554,0,Complications of staging laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy.,"Fifty-four patients underwent staging laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy under general anesthesia for prostatic carcinoma (49), bladder carcinoma (3), penile carcinoma (1), and lymphoma (1). Conversion to an open procedure occurred only once in the series, but three patients received secondary open operations (5.5%). Complications recognized intraoperatively included bladder perforation (2) and mesenteric hematoma (1). One bladder perforation was repaired laparoscopically. The other was treated with catheter drainage. The mesenteric hematoma was explored surgically and found to be minor. Major postoperative complications included bleeding (4) requiring transfusion in two patients. One hematoma became infected requiring percutaneous drainage. One patient required intubation due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Ureteral injury (1) was recognized late and required a psoas hitch and ureteroneocystostomy. Two patients developed small bowel obstructions due to herniation through a trocar site, requiring operative correction. Minor postoperative complications included ileus (4), diarrhea (2), bronchospasm (1), transient obturator nerve palsy (1), electrocardiogram changes (1), and fever (1). The overall major complication rate was 16.7%, and the overall minor complication rate was 18.4%. In this series, a substantial learning curve was seen with regard to complications, but the series compared favorably with open lymphadenectomy."
CD009323,0,8055313,0,Laparoscopic treatment of common bile duct stones. Phantom experiments using electrohydraulic and pulsed dye laser lithotripsy.,"To evaluate the feasibility of laparoscopic transcystic lithotripsy of common bile duct stones, a phantom model comprising bovine liver and biliary tract tissue integrated within a laparoscopic trainer was built. A 9 French cholangioscope was introduced via the cystic duct into the common bile duct in which a human gall stone of known composition had been introduced. Lithotripsy was performed using either a laser or electrohydraulic probe passed through the working channel of the cholangioscope following which the stone fragments were manipulated into the duodenum through the papilla of Vater using the choledochoscope. A total of 20 lithotripsies with each energy form were performed. Lithotripsy was successful in breaking the stones into fragments smaller than 6 mm. The energy expenditure was comparable with a mean of 49 J for laser lithotripsy (range 9 to 159 J), and 53 J (range 16 to 160 J) for electrohydraulic wave lithotripsy. The lithotripsy time measured from introduction of the cholangioscope until its removal was a mean of 30 minutes for electrohydraulic wave lithotripsy and 41 minutes for dye laser lithotripsy. This difference was statistically significant. Macroscopic tissue damage to the common bile duct wall was not observed following any procedure. An additional experiment was performed to evaluate damage that could be caused to the wall of the common bile duct. Both electrohydraulic shock wave and pulsed dye laser lithotripsy without optical feedback regulation caused severe tissue defects when there was tissue contact or distance less than 2 mm. With optical feedback regulation however, no tissue damage was induced by laser lithotripsy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009323,0,8055310,0,Clinical results of common bile duct exploration.,"Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration has been successfully performed in hundreds of patients throughout the world since early 1990. The author reviews his personal experience with this procedure and compares it with the experience of others as reported in the literature. A variety of methods of managing common duct pathology has been employed. These include balloon-catheter manipulation, fluoroscopically-guided basket extraction, and choledochoscopy. The relative contributions of each of these modalities to the total framework of laparoscopic treatment of common bile duct stones is presented. By these techniques, 83 out of 86 patients had their common duct explored successfully. The author concludes that, based on accumulated experience, most, if not all, common duct stones can be treated and/or removed laparoscopically. In more than 90% of the cases, this can be accomplished through a cystic duct approach, although direct access to the common duct via choledochotomy is also possible. A rational protocol for management of common duct pathology is presented."
CD009323,0,8055309,0,Strategy and technique of laparoscopic common bile duct exploration.,"The laparoscopic approach to common bile duct exploration enables the complete clearance of stones from the bile duct without damage to structures of physiological importance such as the ampulla of Vater. Despite preoperative endoscopic retrograde cannulation of the biliary tree (ERCP) in patients with suspected stones, routine intraoperative cholangiography reveals a further 6% with unsuspected common bile duct stones. Both the preoperative suspected stone and the stone found on intraoperative cholangiography can be adequately managed by the laparoscopic method. The approach to the common bile duct via the cystic duct avoids incising the common duct or the sphincter of Oddi. The common bile duct can be approached satisfactorily by balloon dilatation of the cystic duct to 5 mm so enabling the choledochoscope to be inserted into the common bile duct. Small stones are washed into the duodenum or extracted by the Segura basket retrogradely through the cystic duct. Larger stones can be disintegrated by laser or electrohydraulic lithotripsy; the fragments can either be washed into the duodenum or sucked out via the cystic duct. Laparoscopic choledochotomy is indicated for multiple big or proximally located stones. The larger sized Segura basket can be used effectively for these large stones. Residual stones are extracted under cholangioscopic control and any incarcerated stone disintegrated by lithotripsy. A small catheter placed in the common bile duct or a standard T-tube completes the exploration and avoids disordered function of the sphincter of Oddi.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009323,0,8514079,0,Endoscopic therapy for patients with a post-operative biliary leak.,"Twenty-three patients with a post-operative biliary leak were treated by various endoscopic methods and results were analyzed. Leaks occurred at the cystic duct in 13 patients, at the common duct in 6 patients, and at an anomalous branch of the right hepatic duct in 4 patients. Treatments included sphincterotomy alone (4 patients), stent alone (6 patients), sphincterotomy and stent (12 patients), and sphincterotomy and nasobiliary drainage catheter (1 patient). Five patients also had supplemental percutaneous catheter drainage of a biloma. All treatments were completed successfully in the absence of major morbidity, and permanent closure of the leak occurred in 100% of cases. Endoscopic therapy for patients with a post-operative biliary leak is safe and effective and should be recommended before surgical re-exploration."
CD009323,0,8503074,0,Early experience of laparoscopic ultrasonography in the management of pancreatic carcinoma.,"A 7.5-MHz linear array ultrasound probe has been developed for the evaluation of solid organs at laparoscopy. Twelve patients with suspected carcinoma of the head of the pancreas, considered at initial investigation to have resectable disease, were submitted to laparoscopy. In 4 patients, diagnostic laparoscopy revealed hepatic metastases (4 patients), peritoneal dissemination of tumor (2), and malignant ascites (1). Laparoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated hepatic metastases in four patients and hepatic cysts in two further patients. Ultrasound evaluation of the pancreas revealed lymphadenopathy (4 patients), local infiltration (2), and portal vein displacement or invasion (4). An anomalous right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery was identified in one patient. Overall, laparoscopy identified advanced disease in four patients. Laparoscopic ultrasonography, while detecting advanced disease in a further two patients. predicted resectable disease in six patients (50%). Only one of the six patients submitted to laparotomy was found to have irresectable disease due to lymph-node metastases. Laparoscopic ultrasound examination of the pancreas and liver has improved the early staging of pancreatic carcinoma and should be undertaken at an early stage in the management of such patients."
CD009323,0,8489389,0,Routine cholangiography is not warranted during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"The role of intraoperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy was prospectively evaluated in 514 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Before surgery, all patients were assigned to one of three groups depending on the likelihood of their having common bile duct stones. Stratification was based on objective historical, laboratory, or radiologic criteria. In 453 patients deemed unlikely to have stones, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed without cholangiography. Of these patients, four had retained stones (0.9%). In 25 patients likely to have stones, preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography identified stones in six patients (24%). In 36 patients whose likelihood of having stones was deemed indeterminate, intraoperative cholangiography was performed at laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A common bile duct stone was identified in one patient (2.8%). One common bile duct injury occurred in the group deemed unlikely to have stones, and this injury would not have been prevented by intraoperative cholangiography. We conclude that preoperative assessment will identify common bile duct stones and that routine cholangiography is not warranted. Meticulous dissection of the cystic duct at its origin at the infundibulum will prevent common bile duct injury."
CD009323,0,8489093,0,Anatomic variance in the cholecystic blood supply: a case report.,"The cystic artery is known to arise from many possible origins; with the right hepatic artery is the most common. Other origins of the cystic artery include the left hepatic artery, the common hepatic artery, and the superior mesenteric artery. In addition to the variability in origin of the cystic artery, its course can also follow diverse paths, often in close proximity to the common bile duct. This report presents a rare and, to our knowledge, previously unreported deviation of the cystic artery's origin and course that was encountered during cholecystectomy. This rare variant emphasizes the importance of a thorough knowledge of cystic arterial variations that often occur and may be encountered during both open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,8488941,0,Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"We assessed the use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) at our hepatobiliary referral center. This assessment included patients from outside institutions with post-LC problems. Between May 1990 and September 1992, we performed 522 LCs and 1,723 ERCP examinations. There were 78 patients who underwent 143 ERCP examinations after LC, 65% of whom were referred. ERCP findings were categorized as follows: normal results (8%), problems inherent to stone disease (65%), and iatrogenic injury (27%). The types of inherent problems were common bile duct (CBD) stones, pancreatitis, and papillary stenosis/microlithiasis. Within the CBD stone group, 5 of 26 patients also had papillary stenosis, and, within the pancreatitis group, 9 of 11 patients also had papillary stenosis, making papillary stenosis the most frequent observation (55%). Almost all of these patients (96%) required endoscopic papillotomy for successful treatment. The iatrogenic injury group was comprised of 21 patients, 16% of whom had cystic duct leak and 84% of whom had CBD injury. These patients required a variety of endoscopic procedures including endoscopic papillotomy (67%), CBD endoscopic stenting (76%), percutaneous drainage of biloma (29%), and percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (24%). Open surgical procedures after endoscopic assessment or treatment were required in only three patients in the iatrogenic group and in none in the inherent group. At this time, long-term follow-up is not possible with regard to biliary stricture. We conclude that the majority of problems after LC are either due to papillary stenosis/microlithiasis with or without CBD stones or to biliary injury. Both can be successfully diagnosed and treated with endoscopic techniques."
CD009323,0,8480262,0,Intraoperative cholangiography for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Intraoperative cholangiography in the course of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not only valuable to detect common bile duct stones, but also to delineate the anatomy of the biliary ducts, facilitate the dissection, avoid injuries to the biliary tract and identify other abnormalities, such as fistulas, cysts and tumors of the biliary system. Most surgeons use a variation of the transcystic injection of contrast. We describe herein a technique of cholangiography through the gallbladder, performed before starting any dissection in the cystic duct area, which has resulted in a rate of 92 percent of adequate cholangiograms and has proved to be easier, by far, and safer than the transcystic technique. A comparison was made between 405 instances of open cholecystectomies and 200 laparoscopic cholecystectomies with transcystic cholangiograms and 105 laparoscopic cholecystectomies with cholangiograms done through the gallbladder. All instances were done for symptomatic chronic or acute calculous cholecystitis. Satisfactory cholangiograms were obtained in 95 percent of open cholecystectomies and in only 68 percent of transcystic laparoscopic attempts. Complications and false-positive findings were seen in transcystic laparoscopic procedures in five and six instances, respectively. Cholangiography performed through the gallbladder was 100 percent successful among 73 patients with chronic cholecystitis and in 66 percent of 32 patients with acute calculous cholecystitis. For optimal visualization of the bile ducts, it is essential to exert pressure on the gallbladder after the injection of contrast to advance the contrast through the cystic duct. This is greatly facilitated by the use of a double-balloon catheter to avoid leak at the site of the gallbladder puncture."
CD009323,0,8389061,0,Immediate cystic duct occlusion using an endoluminal absorbable polyglycolic acid screw.,"Endoscopic in situ occlusion of the cystic duct and ablation of the gallbladder could constitute a useful alternative to cholecystectomy in certain patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of endoluminal occlusion of the cystic duct using a biodegradable polyglycolic acid screw and simultaneous gallbladder mucosal ablation with a Sotradecol-ethanol mixture. Eight pigs had operative cholecystotomy. A polyglycolic acid screw was twisted into the cystic duct after the proximal cystic duct mucosa was thermally ablated using electrocautery. Cholecystography confirmed occlusion of the cystic duct. Synchronous ablation of the gallbladder mucosa was then done by instilling absolute alcohol and 2% Sotradecol. The gallbladder was drained. Animals were sacrificed on days 14, 28, and 42. All animals survived operation and showed no untoward effects. Postmortem gross inspection showed gallbladders were shrunken and surrounded with adhesions from adjacent tissue. Cholangiography and cholecystography confirmed occlusion of the cystic duct in 6 of 8 pigs (75%). Histopathologic examination showed extensive areas of mucosal necrosis mixed with small areas of epithelial regeneration. Immediate occlusion of the cystic duct is possible using an endoluminal polyglycolic acid screw."
CD009323,0,8372580,0,"A comparison between surgical, endoscopic and percutaneous management of pancreatic pseudocysts--long term results.","In a retrospective study, the data of 127 patients who had been treated in our hospital between 1985 and 1990 for pancreatic pseudocysts were re-examined and analysed in order to evaluate the therapeutic success. In 13 cases (10%), a spontaneous regression was observed. Forty-four patients (35%) were treated surgically, 37 (29%) were managed endoscopically and 7 (6%) received a percutaneous treatment. The remaining 26 patients (20%) had received a combined form of therapy either primarily or later within the course of their treatment. After an average period of 33 months, 97 patients could be either re-questioned or re-examined. The results showed that 50% of the patients treated surgically and 52% of those treated endoscopically were without complaints. The over-all mortality rate was 9%. A lack of success following various therapeutic regimes resulted in up to 20% of all patients. In summary, endoscopic drainage proved to be a simple method with a low complication rate and an alternative to internal surgical drainage particularly for persistent alcoholics and patients over 65 years of age. Endoscopic drainage is not an alternative for patients with persistent abdominal pain symptoms or complications."

CD009323,0,8509045,0,Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy biliary complications.,"Radiological imaging and therapeutic interventions were performed in eight patients with biliary complications following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The diagnostic approach and the outcome of the therapeutic procedures were evaluated. Complications observed were bile leakage from the cystic duct stump (n = 2); erroneous identification of the cystic duct leading to common hepatic duct transection (n = 1) and hepatic duct ligation (n = 2); liver abscess (n = 1); and retained common duct stones (n = 2). Diagnostic ultrasonography is capable of detecting the presence of abnormal fluid collection and the diameter of the common duct with or without the presence of a stone, although bile leaks and retained common duct stones can only be demonstrated by either endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. Once a bile leak had been confirmed, therapeutic endoscopic biliary stenting was successfully applied in one patient while the other received percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. Definitive diagnosis of retained common duct stone was established by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and immediate endoscopic sphincterotomy with stone extraction was performed. Follow-up radiological imaging was done to determine the effectiveness of the therapeutic procedures applied in each patient. All our patients improved clinically, and further surgical intervention was not needed."
CD009323,0,8480889,0,"Exposure, dissection, and laser versus electrosurgery in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","The technical complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy occur while creating the pneumoperitoneum, placing trocars, obtaining exposure, and performing the initial dissection of the cystic duct and artery. The errors most feared are intestinal injury, vascular injury, and common bile duct injury. Bile duct injury usually results from the misinterpretation of the extrahepatic biliary anatomy. Confusion is most likely if the gallbladder infundibulum is pushed superiorly and medially, pulling the common bile duct out from behind the duodenum and into line with the cystic duct and gallbladder. Other dissection errors resulting in bile duct injury include the failure to begin dissection on the gallbladder, routine dissection of the cystic duct all the way to the common bile duct, failure to identify anomalies of the cystic and hepatic ducts, failure to open all folds of the gallbladder infundibulum, and entrapment of a narrow common bile duct by a cystic duct clip ""slid"" too far proximally. Proper dissection strategy includes posterolateral traction on the gallbladder infundibulum and initiation of dissection at the most medial point where the gallbladder is clearly seen. Pedunculation of the gallbladder will reveal most ductal anomalies but should be supplemented with routine digital fluoroscopic cholangiography. The controversy over optimal sources for thermal dissection of the gallbladder has largely been resolved. Electrosurgical dissection is a more rapid, hemostatic, and economical dissection."
CD009323,0,8480888,0,Laparoscopic approach to common duct pathology.,"The author reviews his experience with the laparoscopic management of common duct pathology and compares it with the experience of others as reported in the literature. Routine intraoperative cholangiography is advocated. A variety of methods of managing common duct stones laparoscopically is presented. These include balloon-catheter manipulation, fluoroscopically guided basket extraction, and choledochoscopic evaluation and removal of stones. The accumulated experience indicates that more than 90% of common duct stones can be removed laparoscopically via the cystic duct. This approach significantly reduces the need for either preoperative or postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Although laparoscopic choledochotomy has been employed in a number of cases and can be performed with a high degree of safety and efficacy, it is needed only infrequently. This form of management results in decreased dependence upon T-tubes, thereby reducing postoperative morbidity and the length of hospitalization. A rational protocol for the management of common duct pathology is presented."
CD009323,0,8480885,0,Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Few laparoscopic surgeons currently explore the bile duct at cholecystectomy, which has focused attention on the role of preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the diagnosis and treatment of duct stones. Indications for ERCP depend on the likelihood of duct pathology; clinical, biochemical, and radiologic predictive factors are well established. Expert endoscopists use ERCP sparingly, only in patients known or very likely to have duct stones, believing that the duct can be cleared after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) when necessary in almost every case. Paradoxically, when the level of local ERCP expertise is modest, ERCP may be attempted before LC more often, thus leaving the option of open exploration if ERCP fails. ERCP is highly efficient in the management of patients with symptoms after LC in order to exclude, diagnose, and treat complications such as retained stones, cystic duct leaks, and strictures. Concern about performing sphincterotomy in young patients (especially those with normal-sized ducts) because of unknown long-term effects is leading some endoscopists to remove small stones through the intact papilla. Selected patients with gallbladder and duct stones may be best treated by endoscopic duct clearance alone, without cholecystectomy (unless or until symptoms develop). Overall, ERCP techniques are currently used in about 10% of patients before or after LC. Each surgical/endoscopic team should develop an algorithm to maximize the effectiveness of the combined approach and to minimize problems."
CD009323,0,8480879,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: the European experience.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, initially performed in France in 1987, has rapidly spread to other European countries, the United States, and elsewhere. Of the techniques that have evolved, the ""French"" technique, in which the surgeon stands between the patient's legs, and the ""American"" technique, in which the surgeon stands on the patient's left side, are the most commonly used. In the former technique, the liver is retracted via the mid-clavicular cannula and the infundibulum of the gallbladder via the anterior axillary port. In the latter technique, the liver is retracted by axial traction on the gallbladder through the anterior axillary cannula and the infundibulum through the mid-clavicular cannula. This position may increase the risk of bile duct injury. The technique selected for operative cholangiography should be adapted to the problem at hand. Cystic duct cholangiography shows ductal calculi more reliably due to better filling of the common bile duct; direct puncture of the gallbladder is safer when the biliary anatomy is unclear. A number of European studies confirm the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Mortality rates vary between 0% and 0.1%, and duct injury rates range between 0.2% and 0.6%. Conversion, which is done in 3% to 8% of cases, may be necessary in the case of uncontrollable hemorrhage, bile duct injury unsuitable for laparoscopic repair, or if the gallbladder is densely scarred (scleroatrophic). It can also be done for safety reasons, when the anatomy is unclear. Complications include bile collections due to accessory duct or cystic duct stump leaks or less commonly to common duct injury. The average postoperative stay is longer in Europe (3.2 days) than in the United States. A decision tree is presented for the management of common bile duct stones. In general, preoperatively identified ductal stones are removed by endoscopic sphincterotomy, which is then followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy to remove the source of the calculi. The techniques of laparoscopic choledochotomy and transcystic exploration for the removal of stones in the common bile duct are only beginning to be used, but they may well prove to be the most popular procedures. Results with these procedures will need to be evaluated against those obtained with endoscopic sphincterotomy."

By means of endoscopic technique, two clinically usable methods of creating delayed magnetic cholecystogastric anastomoses and one modality of implanting cholecystoenteric and enteroenteric anastomosis have been worked out in the experiment conducted on 50 mongrels with mechanical icterus. Ring-shaped or rectangular magnets were implanted in the gallbladder through laparoscopic cholecystostomy. Implantation into the stomach was accompanied by simultaneous gastroscopy. In clinical conditions, four endoscopic cholecystogastric anastomoses and one cholecystoduodenal anastomosis have been performed on patients suffering from malignant obstruction of distal bile duct due to cancer of the head of the pancreas, making any radical surgery pointless. The preliminary results indicate that endoscopic magnetic cholecystodigestive anastomoses can serve as a form of palliative treatment of distal bile duct malignant obstructions."

Irrespective of the instruments and techniques utilized, dissection of Calot's triangle must be performed in compliance with the classical rules of bile duct surgery. These rules are: always keep in contact with the gallbladder; completely dissect the Calot's triangle area which must not contain more than one biliary tract element; never dissect the cystic duct beyond the right border of the hepatic choledochus; never section an element that is not identified with certainty; systematically perform a peroperative transcystic cholangiography, in particular to detect the anatomical variants of the extra-hepatic biliary ducts."
CD009323,0,8473173,0,[Mirizzi syndrome--a contraindication for laparoscopic surgery].,"The Mirizzi syndrome refers to a benign obstruction of the common hepatic duct by a stone impacted within the cystic duct or the neck of the gallbladder causing an obstructive jaundice. According to McSherry's subclassification based on endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography we distinguish a type I, involving an external compression of the common hepatic duct by a large stone impacted in the cystic duct or Hartmann's pouch without lesion of the gallbladder or the common hepatic duct wall. In type II a cholecysto-choledochal fistula is present, caused by a calculous which has already eroded partly or completely into the common bile duct. The type I is better treated with a partial cholecystectomy, the type II with a partial cholecystectomy and a bilio-digestive anastomosis. Due to a severe inflammatory process with dense adhesions and odematous changes of the hepato-duodenal ligament, it is dangerous to prepare the Calot's triangle, in case of conventional cholecystectomy and/or in case of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. From 1986-1991 we have successfully treated 10 patients according to this concept (7 patients with type II, 3 patients with type I). We have no mortality and no lesion of the biliary system. One patient has been reoperated because of a postoperative hemorrhage and biliary fistula. One patient developed a benign stricture which could be dilated two months after the procedure. Two patients were found with an incidental carcinoma of the gallbladder."
CD009323,0,8456373,0,Bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"A retrospective review and analysis of patients referred to the Division of Gastroenterology and the Section of Gastrointestinal Surgery with common bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy was undertaken in order to identify injury patterns, management, and outcome. Sixteen patients were identified over a 20-month period. Twelve patients had major common bile duct injuries and four had minor injuries (cystic duct leaks). Seventy-one percent of injuries occurred with surgeons who had done more than 13 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Eighty-three percent of patients who had major ductal injury did not have a cholangiogram prior to the injury. Sixteen percent of patients with major common bile duct injuries had findings of acute cholecystitis and 58% of these major injuries were ""easy"" gallbladders. One-third of major injuries were recognized at operation. Two-thirds of immediate repairs failed. All cystic duct leaks were managed nonoperatively. It appears that bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy are more common in the community than is reported. Bile duct complications occur with surgeons who are experienced and inexperienced with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Common bile duct injuries, unrecognized at laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the majority of cases, usually occur with ""easy"" gallbladders. Operative cholangiography is not utilized in the majority of common bile duct injuries. When immediate repair of common bile duct injuries is undertaken, the majority are unsuccessful. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is invaluable in the diagnosis and management of bile duct complications. Cystic duct leaks may be managed successfully with endoscopic stents."

CD009323,0,8453133,0,An easy approach to laparoscopic cholangiography.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the procedure of choice for surgical removal of the gallbladder. Intraoperative cholangiography is often needed to define ductal anatomy and to detect choledocholithiasis, a procedure which often proves more difficult than its open counterpart. Several newer cholangiocatheters have been introduced which have made laparoscopic cholangiography easier, however, the standard approach through an existing operating port will usually place the catheter at an odd angle, making catheterization of the cystic duct all but impossible in some cases. To avoid this acute angle between the catheter and the cystic duct, the authors have begun using a standard central line introducer as the port through which the catheter is inserted. When placed in the proper position through the lateral abdominal wall, this approach allows the catheter to be inserted parallel and in line with the cystic duct for much easier and faster cannulation."
CD009323,0,8427409,0,Technique of intraluminal biliary ultrasonography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Intraluminal ultrasonography of the common duct was performed in nine patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, using a system comprising a 20-MHz crystal in a 95-cm, blunt-tipped 6F sheath, mechanically rotated at 1,800 rpm. The probe was introduced through an incision in the cystic duct and passed into the duodenum. When the catheter was withdrawn, excellent visualization of the common and cystic ducts and lower end of the common hepatic duct was achieved. In seven patients, the biliary tree was normal. A small calculus was discovered in the common duct in one patient. This stone was not seen on a subsequent cholangiogram and was subsequently retrieved. An additional patient had mucus or sludge noted in the duct, which cast no acoustic shadow and thus was distinguished from calculi. The technique was fast, efficient, and easy to perform in this small group of patients and holds promise for screening the common duct pathology during laparoscopic cholecystectomy."

Indications included symptomatic cholelithiasis (181 cases), acute cholecystitis (15 cases), gallstone pancreatitis (two cases), and cholangitis (three cases). Mean operating time was 78 min. Overall conversion rate was 5.4% (11 cases). Conversion to open procedure was elective in nine patients and enforced in two because of uncontrollable bleeding from the cystic artery. Three of the former nine patients who were converted subsequently had acute cholecystitis. One case of cellulitis at the umbilical stab wound and one case of bile leak, which drained spontaneously, occurred in patients operated on for acute cholecystitis. Laparotomy was performed on the 7th postoperative day for a liver bed hemorrhage in a patient presenting with cholecystitis. One common bile duct injury occurred in a patient with cholecystitis necessitating a biliary reconstruction. No perioperative deaths occurred. Mean hospital stay was 3.4 days. Despite several advantages, laparoscopic cholecystectomy must be performed by surgeons experienced in biliary tract surgery."

A second purpose of this study was to assess the value of laparoscopic staging of pancreatic and liver tumors. A total of 141 cholecystectomy cases were studied, comprising a laparoscopic group (n = 50), an open prospective control group (n = 50), and historical controls (n = 41). The need for postoperative analgesics was significantly reduced with the laparoscopic procedure compared with open cholecystectomy. Hospital stay was 1 (1-5) day after laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus 6 (5-28) days after open cholecystectomy. Time away from work was 9 (4-21) versus 28 (21-60) days. These differences were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Complication rates were 8% in both prospective groups. A similar comparative study of laparoscopic appendectomy versus the open technique was undertaken, with 10 patients in each prospective group. Again, hospital stay and time away from work proved shorter for laparoscopic procedures. Finally, 15 staging procedures for pancreatic and liver cancers were performed. One patient with unresectable liver metastases was spared explorative laparotomy."

CD009323,0,8447133,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: experience of a single surgeon.,"Gallbladder removal using laparoscopic techniques has rapidly been adopted by surgeons around the world. Questions have been raised concerning laparoscopic cholecystectomy, including the safety of the operation, its implications for management of common bile duct stones, and the means by which surgeons should be trained. In the present series, 424 patients were referred to a single surgeon for cholecystectomy during a 22-month period. A traditional open cholecystectomy was performed in 9 patients (2.1%) because of presumed contraindications to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted in the remaining 415 patients (97.9%). On the basis of preoperative investigations, 19 patients (4.6%) underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction were performed in the 13 patients (3.1%) demonstrating choledocholithiasis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was converted to an open operation in 8 patients (1.9%) owing to dense adhesions, obscure anatomy, or cholangiographic abnormalities. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully performed in 407 patients (96%) in 95 +/- 2 minutes (mean +/- SEM). Surgical trainees were involved in all operations and performed 68% of the procedures under supervision. Cystic duct cholangiograms were obtained selectively in 129 patients (30.4%). Intraoperative complications occurred in 3 patients, including 1 patient with a minor injury to the common bile duct (0.2%). There was no perioperative mortality, and major complications occurred in 6 patients (1.4%). Minor complications were seen in 12 others (2.8%), and one patient required reoperation for a trocar injury to the jejunum. Prolonged follow-up has revealed one case of asymptomatic retained common bile duct stones (0.2%). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can therefore be performed in more than 95% of patients with no mortality and minimal morbidity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009323,0,8439755,0,Imaging of complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has gained widespread acceptance for treatment of cholelithiasis. Because radiologists have a primary role in recognizing and treating complications of this surgical technique, we reviewed the clinical records and imaging studies of 29 patients with complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Complications included bile duct injuries (15 cases), retained common bile duct stones (seven cases), cystic duct stump leak (four cases), bowel perforation (two cases), abdominal abscess (two cases), intraperitoneal gallstones (2), and failure to diagnose malignant bile duct obstruction (one case). Twenty-two patients required reoperation, and one patient with bowel perforation died. Eleven of 15 bile duct injuries were imaged prior to hepaticojejunostomy. Nine of 11 were proximal bile duct injuries within 2 cm of the junction of the right and left bile ducts. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) identified the distal extent of injuries, but transhepatic cholangiography (THC) was necessary to fully evaluate the proximal extent of the bile duct abnormalities. ERC was used for diagnosis and treatment of the seven patients with choledocholithiasis. Abdominal films showed intraperitoneal in one patient with bowel perforation, intraperitoneal stones in a second patient, and intraabdominal abscess in one of two patients in whom abdominal films were performed. Computed tomography (CT), done in three patients with bowel perforation or abscess, showed the one duodenal perforation, and the two abscesses. CT also showed bilomas, intraperitoneal gallstones, and unsuspected malignancy. Imaging studies detected and defined complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in all cases."

Indications were biliary pancreatitis in 5 and suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones in the other 6 (based on US or liver function tests, or both). The biliary tree was normal in 9 and laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. In 8 there was uneventful recovery but in the ninth open surgery was required when the attempted cholecystectomy resulted in uncontrolled cystic artery bleeding. Of the remaining 3 patients, 1 underwent sphincterotomy via ERCP and 3 weeks later, laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In the others, we intended to explore the CBD by laparoscopy, but had to resort to open cholecystectomy due to technical difficulties resulting from unsuspected acute cholecystitis. Based on our short experience, ERCP combined with laparoscopic cholecystectomy seems to be both safe and effective."

However, 80% recommended IOC for patients with multiple small gallstones and a dilated cystic duct. If preoperative liver function tests (LFTs) were mildly elevated (1.5 x normal), only 56% of respondents recommended preoperative ERCP. However, 73% of respondents suggested preoperative ERCP for more severe LFT abnormalities. If preoperative ERCP demonstrated choledocholithiasis, most (85%) recommended endoscopic clearance of stones followed by LC. These opinions will be helpful in establishing practice standards for LC."

The mean rate of bile duct injury (exclusive of cystic duct) was 0.6% and was significantly lower at institutions that had performed more than 100 cases. Bile duct injuries were recognized postoperatively in half of the cases and most frequently required anastomotic repair. Intraoperative cholangiography was practiced selectively by 52% of the respondents and routinely by 31%. Bowel and vascular injuries, which occurred in 0.14% and 0.25% of cases, respectively, were the most lethal complications. Postoperative bile leak was recognized in 0.3% of patients, most commonly originating from the cystic duct. Eighteen of 33 postoperative deaths resulted from operative injury. These data demonstrate that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with low rates of morbidity and mortality but a significant rate of bile duct injury."

The current evidence support the use of laparoscopy particularly in hepatic tumors. There is evidence that the hospital length of stay for a patient with a nonresectable hepatic tumor can be reduced from 5.6 +/- 0.4 days with a laparotomy to 1.5 +/- 0.3 days with a laparoscopy. Where the palliative and bypass issues are not limiting, cases of pancreatic and gastric carcinoma also appear to benefit in having a staging laparoscopy before a formal laparotomy for resection. Current instrumentation does produce limits, but with future prospects of laparoscopic ultrasound, and tumor staining, staging laparoscopy will become an important diagnostic tool in surgical oncology."

In spite of generously indicated preoperative ERC, we found in 23 of 376 laparoscopic cholecystectomies unsuspected common bile duct stones by intraoperative in principle cholangiography. 8 patients with known common bile duct stones got a complete laparoscopic therapy. Balloon-dilatation of the ductus cysticus up to 5 mm is followed by laparoscopic choledochoscopy via the cystic duct. Small stones are washed into the duodenum or extraced retrogradely via the cystic duct. For bigger stones the intracorporeal lithotripsy is available, the stone scrap is washed either into the duodenum or is sucked off via the cystic duct. Laparoscopic choledochotomy is indicated for multiple big or proximally fixed stones. In this way stone extraction can be effectively performed, incarcerated stones are treated by additional lithotripsy. A microdrainage of the common bile duct or a T-tube drainage secures the bile flow until restitution of papillary function. The common bile duct is sewn by running suture. In the case of regular cholangiography the microdrainage can be removed on the third postoperative day. In 96% of the laparoscopic cholecystectomies intraoperative cholangiography was possible. 3 of 21 patients with transductus cysticus-exploration had to undergo postoperative EPT due to residual stone fragments. 6 laparoscopic choledochotomies showed the efficacy of the endoscopic operation technique, demonstrating the probability of complications in the postoperative period to be equivalent to that of conventional operations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

At the time of diagnosis, only 15% of patients are resectable (and potentially curable), 40% have localized but unresectable tumours, and 45% distant metastases. Computerized tomography, angiography, and laparoscopy allow for adequate staging in this neoplasm. The latter is useful for identifying the small (1-2 mm) peritoneal and liver implants which, in our experience, are present in 27% of patients with tumours of the pancreatic head and in 65% of those with cancers of the body and tail of the pancreas.

Accurate localization of an occult insulinoma in the body of the pancreas was achieved in one patient with the technique described. Laparoscopic contact ultrasonography of the pancreas by the infragastric approach should be as reliable as open intraoperative ultrasonography and constitutes the first step in the laparoscopic treatment of insulinoma.
CD009323,0,7583970,0,Surgical treatment of peptic ulceration.,"Evidence continues to accrue that proximal gastric vagotomy is a safe and effective elective operation for duodenal ulcer. Recurrent ulceration remains the major shortcoming of the procedure but reoperation is rarely required. Laparoscopic surgery for peptic ulcer disease is rapidly evolving with anterior seromyotomy and posterior truncal vagotomy emerging as the elective procedure of choice. Perforated ulcer can also be treated by laparoscopic techniques in some cases. Hemorrhage is often amenable to initial endoscopic control measures, but when surgery is required, a definitive acid-reducing operation should be employed. Ulcerogenic drug use appears to be responsible for an increasing number of emergency interventions for life-threatening peptic ulcer complications, although simple closure of perforation due to such drugs may be sufficient surgical treatment. Long-term follow-up data suggest that there is a real risk increase for gastric remnant cancer development 20 years after partial gastrectomy for peptic ulcer but the value of regular endoscopic screening of patients at risk has not been demonstrated. The long-acting somatostatin analogue, octreotide acetate, has been shown to ameliorate the symptoms of the postoperative dumping syndrome markedly, although the mechanism of action remains largely unknown."

In addition, ERCP revealed small stones in the bile-duct in eight of 154 patients with normal biochemical results and unremarkable ultrasound imaging, and in seven patients bile-duct anomalies which required EPT or open cholecystectomy. However, in retrospect five of the patients with cystic duct anomalies could have been treated by LC. The complication rate of ERCP/EPT was 3.2%.

In such cases, ligation of the cystic duct with an Endoloop offers a solution to the problem. The standard technique for application of an Endoloop consists of dividing the cystic duct and then applying the Endoloop. This becomes more difficult if, after the cystic duct is divided, loss of traction on the common bile duct results in retraction of the divided cystic stump outside of the laparoscopic field of view. To avoid this difficulty, the authors apply an Endoloop with the grasping forceps on the cystic duct before the duct is divided so that it cannot retract from operative view and for this task developed an instrument that allows simultaneous introduction of both grasping forceps and the Endoloop through a single port."

In 55% of these cases the conversion was due to difficulty in dissecting the gallbladder or cystic duct. Peri-operative cholangiography should be performed routinely, not only to verify the vacuity of the common bile duct (13% of the conversions) but, more particularly, to ensure the integrity of the principal biliary pathway during the dissection (8.5% of the conversions). Cholecystectomy under celioscopy is a proven and safe technique, on the condition that all stages of classical surgery can be carried out under good conditions."

Both patients were successfully treated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, utilizing sphincterotomy and nasobiliary tube placement. Characteristics of this syndrome and advantages of this form of therapy are emphasized."
CD009323,0,1468390,0,Preliminary experience using laparoscopic transcystic cholangioscopy for treatment of common bile duct stones.,"Laparoscopic transcystic cholangioscopy (LTC) in combination with electrohydraulic lithotripsy may be an alternative treatment to ERCP and sphincterotomy in patients with both gallbladder and common bile duct stones undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Preliminary experience using LTC lithotripsy in 13 cases is reported. In 12 cases the stones were pushed out into the duodenum using the tip of the cholangioscope, in 8 of them stone disintegration via LTC lithotripsy also being required. In the remaining case the cholangioscope could not be inserted into the common bile duct via the cystic duct due to complete cystic duct obstruction. The average hospital stay was 9 days (range 6-16) in patients with LTC/lithotripsy, which did not differ significantly from 8.4 days (range, 4-19) (n = 330) in the group undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy alone. The patients usually resumed normal activity the day after discharge. LTC lithotripsy has the advantages over endoscopic sphincterotomy of a shorter treatment and preservation of a normal functioning sphincter of Oddi. Further technical improvements, especially the development of a cholangioscope for this purpose, are urgently required."

The purpose of this investigation was threefold: to study an animal model for chemical sclerosis of the gallbladder with 95% ethanol and 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate, to attempt chemical sclerosis immediately after percutaneous cystic duct obliteration by laser thermocoagulation, and to assess histopathologic changes in the gallbladder after sclerosis."
CD009323,0,1410361,0,Intraoperative bile duct sonography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: experience with a 12.5-MHz catheter-based US probe.,"During elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 20 patients underwent intraoperative evaluation of the biliary tract with a commercial 6.2-F, 12.5-MHz catheter-based ultrasound (US) probe. The study tested the feasibility of this technology for mapping the anatomy of the hepatoduodenal ligament and Calot triangle, assessing bile duct integrity, and detecting choledocholithiasis. The duct was studied with a transmural approach, the catheter being placed parallel to, but remaining outside, the bile duct. The common hepatic duct and common bile duct in the vicinity of the cystic duct were seen in all 20 patients; the junction of the cystic duct with the common hepatic duct was seen in nine patients (45%). After the cystic duct was clamped, no sonographic evidence to suggest bile duct injury was noted in any patient. The transmural imaging approach was tested in four pigs in whose common bile duct a single human calculus had been placed. In all instances the size and location of the calculus were accurately detected. Intraoperative US with a catheter-based system is a safe and effective means for interrogation of the extrahepatic biliary tree during laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,1295909,0,[Safety of cholecystectomy by laparotomy in elective situation and in emergency].,"Cholecystectomy is the only effective treatment of gallbladder stones. A retrospective study was carried out on results of 658 cholecystectomies by laparotomy without choledochotomy performed between January 1987 and December 1989, to determine morbidity and mortality of elective and emergency surgery and by age. Operations for tumors of the gallbladder and choledolithiasis were not included in the analysis. During this period, cholecystectomy was performed electively in 387 cases and under emergency conditions in 261 patients. Mortality and post-operative morbidity were 0% and 14.7% respectively after elective surgery, increasing to 1.1% (Fisher = 0.0617) and 25.2 (p = 0.0004) respectively after emergency operations. This large increase in postoperative morbidity in urgent cases was due to an increase in systemic and not local complications, as a result of the higher proportion of emergency operations with advancing age. Since elective cholecystectomy is safe it can be proposed to patients with symptoms, including the elderly. It is difficult at present to compare results of cholecystectomy by laparotomy with those of laparoscopy since the average age of in the latter category is markedly lower and the number of acute cases still low. The principal advantage of celioscopy could be a long term reduction in systemic complications in emergency operations."
CD009323,0,1470281,0,Gallbladder disease in cystic fibrosis.,"Among the various gastrointestinal manifestations observed in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), gallbladder abnormalities occur frequently. These include a high prevalence of nonfunctioning gallbladders (30%), micro-gallbladders (8-30%), and gallstones (4-30%). The underlying pathophysiology for this increased prevalence in patients with CF is not completely understood, due to contradictory findings. These findings concern: (1) abnormalities in bile acid metabolism resulting in bile that is supersaturated with cholesterol, (2) an impaired nucleation time, and (3) biliary stasis, due to bile duct abnormalities and/or impaired gallbladder motility. The diagnosis of gallbladder disease in CF may be obscured by other common gastrointestinal complications, resulting in a long delay between onset of symptoms and the diagnosis. Cholecystectomy in CF is the treatment of choice, provided they are carefully managed in the pre- and perioperative period. The operative morbidity and mortality, even with intensive management of pulmonary disease, amounted to 10% and 5%, respectively. Therefore, alternative options, like laparoscopic cholecystectomy are of interest and require further investigation, especially for CF patients with severe pulmonary disease."

Its clinical significance results from problems that occur in differential diagnosis to granulomatous hepatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, multiple microabscesses or diffuse tumour infiltration of the liver, when it is incidentally found in ultrasound, ERCP or laparoscopy. The characteristic findings in these examinations are described in two case reports. The ultrasonic pattern of multiple intrahepatic double structures, microcystic areas and surrounding hyperechoic reflexes are in accordance with multiple intrahepatic microcystic and hazy areas in ERCP x-rays and multiple white-yellowish areas that retract liver surface in laparoscopy. Final diagnosis is confined by the characteristical microscopic finding of von Meyenburg-complexes in liver biopsy."
CD009323,0,1425466,0,Preliminary experience using an ultrasonic aspirator for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"An ultrasonic aspirator (Olympus) specially designed for laparoscopic surgery, which also includes cautery and suction-irrigation systems, was evaluated in 40 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The generating power of each system is controlled by hand or foot switches, and most operating procedures could easily be performed through a 10 mm trocar inserted through the abdominal wall. The ultrasonic aspirator successfully fragmented and aspirated soft tissue, allowing a precise differentiation between the cystic duct and artery, small vessels, lymphatics and fibrous tissue. Removal of the gallbladder could be performed successfully using the cautery and ultrasonic aspirator, whereby parts of cauterization or division could easily be identified. Identification of the cystic duct and artery, course of the cystic duct and Hartmann's pouch in the same field of vision was possible which is important for avoiding major complications such as injury of the common bile duct. No complications were seen during or after surgery in any of the patients."
CD009323,0,1421544,0,Laparoscopic cholangiography: a new method and device.,"Laparoscopic cholangiography is invaluable in the detection of bile duct stones, visualization of ductal anomalies and discovery and prevention of iatrogenic injuries to the bile ducts. The use of this procedure is, however, limited by the technical difficulties of cystic duct cannulation. A method of laparoscopic cholangiography that avoids cystic duct cannulation is described. It consists of a Kumar I Cholangiography Clamp that is applied across the gallbladder just above the Hartmann's pouch and divides the gallbladder into a medial and lateral compartment. A Kumar Cholangio Catheter is then introduced through the side-channel of the clamp, puncturing the medial compartment (i.e. the Hartmann's pouch) with a short #22 gauge needle for aspiration, followed by dye injection. Cholangiography was obtained with remarkable ease in 49 of the first 50 cases (98%) without complication."
CD009323,0,1388297,0,Biliary ductal anatomy and anomalies. The role of intraoperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Biliary ductal anomalies of surgical importance can occur in 10% of patients. The short cystic duct draining into the common bile or right hepatic duct and the extreme proximity of the common bile duct in case of spiral or posterior entry of the cystic duct--if not recognized in time--can result in ductal injuries. The new mobile, digitized fluoroscopic units provide a vastly improved image within minutes. In case of an inadvertent ductal injury (extravasation, no contrast material visible in the proximal ductal system) the surgeon can immediately repair the injury. Routine intraoperative cholangiography is strongly recommended during laparoscopic cholecystectomies."

A report of 9 cases].,"Alagille's syndrome or arteriohepatic dysplasia has been described in Cuba in nine patients between nine months and 12 years of age (8 males and one female). Among the clinical features we found five major abnormalities: chronic cholestasis with neonatal jaundice (9/9), peculiar facies (9/9), peripheral pulmonary artery hypoplasia associated with cardiac murmur (6/9), butter-fly-like arch defects (4/9), and posterior embryotoxon (6/7). Two children had a severe xanthomatosis. Laparoscopy showed green hepatomegaly depending on the degree of cholestasis, and only one patient had incipient signs of micronodular cirrhosis. Liver histology showed a paucity of interlobular bile ducts. Survival was of 60%. One patient survived more than 30 years. Four patients died of liver carcinoma (unique report in infants), broncho-pneumonia, acute renal failure, and sudden death respectively. Among the minor features were mental retardation (5/9), a peculiar voice (3/9), growth retardation observed in some of our patients. This is the first report on Alagille's syndrome in Latin America, because so far reports have come only from Europe and North America."
CD009323,0,1301217,0,Gallstones and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Gallstones and Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy brought together surgeons, endoscopists, hepatologists, gastroenterologists, internists, radiologists, and epidemiologists as well as other health care professionals and the public to address (1) the indications for treatment of patients with gallstones; (2) the role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in treating patients with gallstones; (3) the role of alternative medical and surgical treatments for gallstones; (4) the comparative results of laparoscopic cholecystectomy with open cholecystectomy and other available treatments; (5) techniques for detecting and treating bile duct stones with or without laparoscopic cholecystectomy; and (6) future directions for research in prevention and management of gallstone disease and in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Following 2 days of presentations by experts and extensive discussion by the audience, a consensus panel weighed the evidence and prepared their consensus statement. Among their findings, the panel concluded that (1) most patients who experience symptoms of gallstones should be treated; (2) in comparison with open cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy provides a safe and effective treatment for most patients with symptomatic gallstones and has become the treatment of choice for many patients; (3) patients who are not good candidates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy include those with generalized peritonitis, septic shock from cholangitis, severe acute pancreatitis, endstage cirrhosis, and gallbladder cancer; (4) laparoscopic cholecystectomy decreases pain and disability without increasing mortality and morbidity and can be performed at an equal or lower cost than open cholecystectomy; and (5) every effort should be made to ensure that surgeons performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy are properly trained and credentialed.

CD009323,0,1627444,0,Gallbladder and biliary interventional radiology.,"The past ten years have seen the introduction of a number of new techniques for the treatment of biliary diseases. In this report, we discuss the roles of both extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy and percutaneous treatment of gallstones, and we emphasize the changing role of these techniques since the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The literature on chemical cholecystectomy is reviewed with particular reference to experience in humans. Biliary endoprosthesis using expandable metallic stents is discussed in patients with benign and malignant biliary obstruction.

CD009323,0,1403538,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in children: initial experience and recommendations.,"Our initial experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy in children and the modification of techniques required for pediatric surgical patients is reported. Six children aged 6 to 17 years underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. All patients had biliary colic and did not require concomitant intraabdominal surgical procedures. Average operative time was 89 minutes; none were converted to open cholecystectomy. One patient returned home the evening of surgery, two patients were discharged the following morning, and two patients were discharged 2 days following the procedure because of their distance from home. There were no complications. All patients have remained asymptomatic on follow-up of 1 to 5 months. Based on this initial experience, several changes in the technique as reported in adults are recommended. Due to the softness and laxity of the anterior abdominal wall, an infraumbilical incision for the 10-mm camera trocar is more cosmetically acceptable and just as efficient. There is a smaller intraabdominal space with which to work, tempting one to overinflate the abdomen for better visualization. Care should be taken to ensure that the intraabdominal pressure does not exceed 15 mm Hg despite the small volumes required to do so. Placement of the second epigastric incision is more inferior and lateral than the standard recommendation for adults. The cystic duct must be controlled as early as possible in the operative course to prevent egress of stones from the gallbladder into the common duct. In one patient, these migrating stones were milked back into the gallbladder and a second clip placed."

The authors report the successful treatment of a patient with this syndrome by laparoscopic means. A flexible 5.0 mm choledochoscope was inserted under laparoscopic guidance into the dilated proximal cystic duct and the impacted stone was extracted. Though still a technically demanding procedure, the authors feel that under certain conditions, laparoscopic surgery may represent the preferred initial approach to patients with Mirizzi's syndrome."
CD009323,0,1383512,0,Sutured laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy evolved in an animal model.,"In a series of acute and chronic experiments conducted in young pigs during a 2-year period, we have evolved a quick knotting technique to start and end a suture line and developed a curved 'Endoski' needle to improve needle passage through the tissues. These have been employed in the construction of cholecystojejunal anastomoses using a semi-closed technique with a single layer (deep seromuscular) of continuous polyglactin sutures. In chronic experiments in pigs, patent well healed bilioenteric anastomoses, which conveyed bile satisfactorily after ligation of the common bile duct, distal to the cystic duct, were achieved. A virtual absence of adhesions in these animals was noted."
CD009323,0,1362118,0,Complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy: an analysis of 200 cases.,"Complications of the initial 200 cases of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) at the Cathay General Hospital within a period of 11 months were reviewed from video documents of the operations and clinical records. The major complication rate was 3.5%, including one common bile duct (CBD) injury (0.5%), three retained CBD stones (1.5%), one subphrenic fluid accumulation (0.5%), one liver abscess (0.5%) and one cystic duct stump bile leakage (0.5%). All major complications were cholecystectomy-related, and only one of the seven occurred in cases of acute cholecystitis. Age and sex were not related to its occurrence. The rate of minor complications ranged from 0.5% to 10%; they were: shoulder and back pain (10%), gall bladder perforation (10%), retained stones in the abdominal cavity (5%), transient nausea and diarrhea (5%), extension of umbilical port to a mini-laparotomy (3.5%), prolonged operation time > three hours (2%), subcutaneous emphysema (1.5%), wound infection (1.5%) and prolonged ileus (0.5%). The minor complications occurred largely in patients with acute cholecystitis. The complications occurred mostly during the early period of our study, indicating a learning period phenomenon. These could have been avoided if we had had a thorough knowledge of the potential complications and had strictly followed the principles of laparoscopic surgery. We conclude that LC is safe and the complication rate is not higher than that for open cholecystectomy. Most of the complications are preventable if LC is performed by qualified biliary surgeons following strict precautions."
CD009323,0,1631453,0,[Gallstones: natural course and complications].,"Cholelithiasis is a common clinical situation. In most individuals it takes an inconspicuous clinical course. In symptomatic patients the complications have to be considered: acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, choledocholithiasis, pancreatitis, ileus by large stones and--in a subgroup of patients--carcinoma of the biliary system. Therapy is warranted in symptomatic patients in order to prevent complications. The decision for use of surgical versus non surgical interventions is decided on a individual basis. In general laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the procedure of choice nowadays. A prophylactic cholecystectomy is as a rule not indicated in asymptomatic patients."
CD009323,0,1535733,0,Carcinoid tumor of the gallbladder: laparoscopic resection and review of the literature.,"A 75-year-old woman with mild elevation of liver function test results was found to have an asymptomatic mass localized to the gallbladder by computed tomographic scan and ultrasonography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed a fixed 2 x 4 cm filling defect in the gallbladder wall, consistent with a gallbladder neoplasm. The gallbladder and intramural neoplasm were excised successfully by use of uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Pathologic analysis revealed a carcinoid tumor of the gallbladder. All previously reported gallbladder carcinoid tumors in the Western literature are reviewed. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has potential for application for the treatment of selected gallbladder neoplasms, with special preoperative assessment and intraoperative considerations being important."
CD009323,0,1535731,0,Initial experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the Beth Israel Medical Center.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has changed the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. We present an initial experience with this technique. From March 1990 to March 1991, there were 250 patients who were studied. There were 182 females and 68 males, with most classified as American Society of Anesthesiology Index Class I or II. All procedures were done using electrocautery. There was a definite learning curve for the procedure as evidenced by the duration of the operation. The mean time to perform the procedure was 112 minutes for the first 50 patients and 79 minutes for the last 50 patients. We converted 12 percent of the procedures to an open cholecystectomy for a variety of reasons, the most common being inflammation and adhesions in the triangle of Calot. However, we only had a 4 percent conversion rate in the last 50 patients. There were nine serious complications, with no deaths. The most frequent was a bile leak from the cystic duct stump. Other complications included a pneumothorax, requiring chest tube drainage and an unobserved carcinoma of the stomach. There were no injuries to the common bile duct. The results of our current experience confirm the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. The use of electrocautery is safe during laparoscopy and the need for a laser is optional. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy will continue to evolve as more experience is gained and new instruments are introduced."
CD009323,0,1509787,0,[Endosonography in gastroenterology--an intermediate evaluation].,Endoscopic ultrasonography has widened the diagnostic spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders in two respects: For the first time it became possible to visualize the gastrointestinal wall with its layer structure. EUS was shown to be highly accurate in the local staging of gastrointestinal tumors (T and N stage). The clinical relevance of endosonography derives from stage-dependent treatment protocols selecting patients for different forms of tumor therapy. The second advantage of endosonography is a high-resolution imaging of the pancreas enabling the detection of small lesions (e.g. endocrine tumors). Endoscopic ultrasonography is furthermore the most reliable method for local staging of pancreatic and ampullary carcinoma. The role of endosonography in benign gastroenterological disorders is less well established. With the increasing use of laparoscopic surgery endosonography may become even more important in the future.
CD009323,0,1416673,0,Laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy: our first 200 patients.,"A series of 200 consecutive patients were considered for laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy was attempted in 195 cases and was performed in 192 cases. Laparoscopy was performed in five patients, but laparoscopic cholecystectomy was not attempted owing to dense adhesions (3), cholangiocarcinoma (1) and an absent gallbladder (1). The indications for operation were symptomatic gallstones which included biliary colic (142), acute cholecystitis (49) and gallstone pancreatitis (9). The median duration of operation was 75 min. Operative cholangiography was attempted in 151 (77%) of cases, and was successful in 85% of attempts. Laparoscopic common bile duct visualisation was performed three times with successful stone extraction twice. The other common bile duct was normal. The median duration of postoperative hospital stay was 2 days, for return to normal activity 6 days, and for return to work 10 days. Mean analgesic and antiemetic requirements were approximately one-third of those for open cholecystectomy. Of the patients, 94% reported good or excellent overall satisfaction and 96% reported excellent cosmetic results. Seven complications occurred (4%). Three patients had immediate conversion to laparotomy owing to haemorrhage (2) and gallbladder rupture (1). Four patients required laparotomy for postoperative complications (common bile duct damage, slipped clips from cystic duct, perforated duodenum and leaking accessory hepatic duct). No complications occurred in the last 140 cases. These data suggest that laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy reduces the discomfort of laparotomy and allows a shorter postoperative recovery. The operation has a learning curve, but will ultimately be applicable to the majority of patients with symptomatic gallstones."
CD009323,0,1387068,0,[Laparoscopic side-to-side gastrojejunostomy].,"Development of laparoscopic stapling devices and growing experience with the new method made resective and reconstructive operations on the digestive system accessible to laparoscopy. After extensively testing the method on pigs, we now report on laparoscopic gastro-jejunostomies performed in two patients for gastric stenosis due to inoperable carcinoma of the pancreas. The technique is described. It requires expensive instruments and a very skilled surgeon. While being a safe procedure in the hands of a well-trained surgeon, it presents a high degree of difficulty. Therefore, in order to avoid complications, it should not be advised for a large scale application before results of a greater number of cases can be presented."
CD009323,0,1340828,0,[The diagnostic efficacy of ultrasonography-guided puncture cytology in hepatic masses].,"The aim of this work was to evaluate the diagnostic reliability of fine needle cytology guided by ultrasonography in hepatic masses. One hundred and fifty nine patients underwent this procedure. The final diagnosis was confirmed by histology obtained by percutaneous biopsy, surgery, laparoscopy and necropsy or adequate clinical follow-up in 139 cases. Twenty cases were excluded since no final diagnosis was available. In 102 cases the method was applied on an outpatient basis, while the remainder were hospitalized. There were 9 (6.4%) false negatives, whose final diagnosis were hepatocarcinoma in 4, adenocarcinoma in 3, cholangiocarcinoma in 1 and in a non Hodgkin lymphoma. The global sensitivity of the method was 93.5%, the specificity 100% and the efficiency 93.5%. In hepatocarcinomas the sensitivity was 73.3%, the specificity 100% and the efficiency 73.3%. In metastatic adenocarcinomas the sensitivity was 96.2%, the specificity 100% and the efficiency 73.3%. Except for a single hepatocarcinoma patient who developed hemoperitoneum and 2 patients who required parenteral analgesics, complications were entirely lacking. Fine needle cytology guided by ultrasonography in hepatic masses is a highly efficient method to confirm, rule out and stage liver malignancy and benign lesions in a fast low-cost fashion. The low sensitivity in hepatocarcinomas is attributable to tumor size and histological differentiation."
CD009323,0,1595023,0,Intraoperative sonography during cholecystectomy for gallstones.,"The current study reports on the ease and results of intraoperative sonography in 131 patients operated upon for gallstones. Sonography was performed through a standard incision or a small incision, without duodenal mobilization and prior to systematic cholangiography. Sonography or cholangiography, or both, detected biliary duct stones in eight patients. The entire biliary tract was visualized by ultrasound in 123 patients. Sonography identified seven patients with stones in the major biliary ducts and overlooked only a single stone of the cystic duct. In contrast, intraoperative cholangiography failed to reveal stones in a right hepatic duct and led, in another instance, to unnecessary choledochotomy. During cholecystectomy for gallstones, sonography is a simple efficient technique providing good detection of biliary stones. It is the study of choice and cholangiography is required in only selected instances in which sonographic visualization is incomplete. There may be future value in sonographic applications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,1581137,0,Interventional radiology in the biliary tract.,"Numerous papers have appeared in the past year outlining the expanded role of the radiologist in the treatment of patients with biliary disease, including papers describing palliative treatment of patients with obstructive jaundice due to malignant disease using self-expanding metallic biliary endoprostheses placed percutaneously, extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy used to treat patients with gallstones and intrahepatic stones, percutaneous rotational contact biliary lithotripsy, pulsed dye laser biliary lithotripsy, percutaneous biliary intervention via a minicholecystotomy, conventional percutaneous fluoroscopic management of bile duct stones, and percutaneous management of biliary strictures including transluminal biopsy. Percutaneous evaluation and treatment of patients with biliary disease using cholangioscopy as an adjuvant to biliary intervention, radionuclide imaging for improved evaluation of suspected biliary injury after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and percutaneous treatment of the critically ill patient with cholecystitis or the patient with a perforated gallbladder are also discussed. Diagnostic and therapeutic options available to radiologists for treating patients with biliary disease are summarized."
CD009323,0,1534464,0,Laparoscopic anatomy of the cystic artery.,"Uncontrolled arterial bleeding during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a serious problem and may increase the risk of bile duct damage. Therefore, accurate identification of the anatomy of the cystic artery is important. We reviewed the anatomy of the cystic artery and its variations as seen through the video laparoscope. A ""normal"" cystic artery was found in only 72% of patients. The most important laparoscopically noted variations were doubling of the cystic artery (22%) and an artery that ran inferior to the cystic duct (6%). Small branches of the cystic artery, which we suggest be named Calot's arteries, supply the cystic duct and may cause troublesome bleeding during laparoscopic dissection in the hepatobiliary triangle. A scissor dissection technique was found most useful for identifying the arterial anatomy. Careful identification of arterial anomalies should help to reduce the incidence of bile duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,1467784,0,Surgery in Barrett's oesophagus.,"Surgical treatment for a columnar-lined oesophagus (CLO) may be considered in terms of indications, procedures and risks. Reflux may be an indication for surgery, but does not lead to reversal of epithelium, nor does it eliminate malignant potential. Whether it reduces such potential is not certain. Anti-reflux surgery is therefore based on reflux-related criteria, and not as a treatment for a CLO. Dysplasia is a possible indication for surgery, but as progression to carcinoma may be slow, must not be considered an absolute indication in an elderly, frail patient. Malignancy is a clear indication for operation in a patient deemed fit enough to withstand it. Anti-reflux operations have been standardized over recent years, and aim at exclusion of gastric juice from the oesophagus. Another approach is to alter refluxed material qualitatively by a duodenal diversion procedure. This eliminates bile and pancreatic juice from the oesophagus, with dramatic effects on inflammation but without reversal of a CLO. Reversal of inflammation may facilitate endoscopic surveillance. Either dysplasia or carcinoma are treated by oesophagogastric resection. Newer forms of laparoscopic or thoracoscopic dissection may be particularly applicable with dysplasia or early carcinoma in CLO. Palliative surgery for advanced tumours is not often required today. Risks of anti-reflux surgery must be balanced against symptoms. Risks are reduced if splenectomy is avoided, and operations avoided where possible in the elderly. Resection for dysplasia or carcinoma is high-risk surgery. In the young there is much to gain, and the risks are lower. In the elderly, in the absence of other treatment, risks must be balanced against general health and life expectancy."

The technique, rationale and results for our first 17 patients who underwent laparoscopic placement of a tube jejunostomy are described. Laparoscopic feeding tube placement is a safe and cost-effective method to gain enteral access and stage the oncology patient's disease. This procedure is less invasive than standard surgery for tumour staging and feeding tube placement, and facilitates formula advancement and the patient's early hospital release without morbidity or mortality."
CD009323,0,1534394,0,[Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in The Netherlands: early national results].,"The results of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 58 of the 66 hospitals in which surgeons introduced this method after attending a practical course are evaluated. Data of 546 patients were collected. The indication for laparoscopic surgery was symptomatic gallstone disease without evidence of common bile duct stones, cholecystitis or previous upper abdominal surgery. In 70% of the 58 hospitals fewer than 10 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed nine months after the first practical course because of shortage of equipment. The mean age was 50 years (range 20-80) with a male:female ratio of 1:4. The average operation time was 95 minutes. In 8.2% of the patients the laparoscopic procedure was converted to laparotomy. Adhesions, cholecystitis or difficulty in recognition of the anatomy was responsible for the conversion in 31 of the 45 patients. In the remaining 14 patients bleeding or bile leakage during the procedure compelled the surgeon to perform a laparotomy. One patient died because of bleeding from the cystic artery. Eleven patients underwent laparotomy postoperatively because of bleeding (3), bile leakage (6) and lesion of the ductus choledochus (2). Minor complications occurred in 30 patients. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is expanding rapidly in the Netherlands. The early results are encouraging, although the experience is limited. Further registration is necessary to be able to compare the results of laparoscopic cholecystectomy more critically with those of conventional cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,1534048,0,[Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Initial experiences and results in 278 patients].,"Of 467 cholecystectomies (performed between 13. 6. 1990 and 12. 9. 1991) 278 were done by laparoscopy (196 women, 82 men; mean age 53 [18-86] years). Contraindications to a laparoscopic procedure were acute cholecystitis, severe chronic cholecystitis with adhesions, abnormal clotting and suspected gallbladder carcinoma. In 31 patients (11.1%) the initial laparoscopic cholecystectomy was continued as a conventional cholecystectomy, usually because of unclear conditions in severe chronic cholecystitis. Mean duration of hospital stay was 6.3 days for the laparoscopic procedure compared with 11.5 days for the conventional one. Complications occurred in four patients (in 12 with the conventional method): one occlusion (by clip) of the common bile duct, one bile leak, one bleeding and one pneumothorax, requiring re-operation in three patients. There were no deaths (compared with two in the conventional group). Assuming correct indications, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a sparing method for the treatment of cholecystolithiasis."
CD009323,0,1533759,0,Bile leak after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Diagnostic and therapeutic application of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, introduced less than 2 years ago, is widely accepted by patients and physicians despite the lack of controlled trials comparing this technology with conventional cholecystectomy. Recent series have described a variable incidence of biliary tract injury with laparoscopic gallbladder removal. The primary interaction of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with this technology is usually in the preoperative or postoperative diagnosis and treatment of common bile duct stones."
CD009323,0,1526847,0,[Bile duct surgery in acute pancreatitis].,"Established principles of biliary surgery in connection with biliary pancreatitis include cholecystectomy to prevent recurrence of pancreatitis and biliary drainage if an impacted papillary stone is present. Controversies persist with regard to laparoscopic cholecystectomy and with regard to the timing of ERC and endoscopic papillotomy. The role of early prophylactic ERC has become more clear when in 1988 Carr Locke and coworkers presented a prospective series of patients randomised for different management modalities and stratified according to severity of the pancreatitis. Thus the current recommendation is to plan early ERC and papillotomy for those patients who, according to one of the severity scoring systems, are at risk for a complicated course. Patients with predicted mild disease will not profit from this procedure and are unnecessarily exposed to its risks."
CD009323,0,1405769,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: operative technique.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the routine procedure for most patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis. At our institution, a two-surgeon, four-cannula technique is used. In almost all patients, a pneumoperitoneum can be established with use of a closed technique. Adherence to standard operative principles and careful attention to details in the laparoscopic technique will routinely result in the safe completion of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Cautery provides excellent hemostasis during dissection of the gallbladder from its attachments. Cholangiography through the gallbladder or the cystic duct is easily performed in selected patients. Minimal perioperative care is necessary for patients who undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and the hospitalization time is usually less than 24 hours."
CD009323,0,1380188,0,Laparoscopic cholecystjejunostomy as palliation for obstructive jaundice in inoperable carcinoma of pancreas.,"Malignant obstructive jaundice can be palliated by either surgical bypass, which has the advantage of long-term patency, or by stent placement, which has the advantage of initial lower morbidity and mortality. We describe a technique, laparoscopic cholecystjejunostomy, which has the advantage of both. We predict that laparoscopic surgery, which has already had a major impact on biliary stone surgery, will also have a major impact on interventional endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography."
CD009323,0,1534183,0,[Laparoscopic cholecystectomy--experiences and results with a new surgical technique].,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a genuine alternative to open cholecystectomy. Acute cholecystitis, chronic cholecystitis with adhesions and gallbladder cancer are absolute, and bile duct stones in rare situations and previous surgery relative contraindications. Ultrasound and intravenous cholecysto-cholangio-tomography are obligatory preoperative investigations. Over 14 months we performed 253 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Mortality was 0%. Relaparotomy was necessary in 3 of 4 complications (injury of the common bile duct, bile leak and hemorrhage), the reoperation rate is 1.18%. The fourth complication was a pneumothorax after injury of the diaphragm with the electrohook. Conversion to open cholecystectomy was necessary in 10.7%, usually after severe chronic cholecystitis with adhesions. The length of hospitalization was 11 days after open cholecystectomy and could be reduced to 6.5 days after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. With similar results concerning mortality and reoperation rate, the advantages of laparoscopic cholecystectomy are reduced postoperative pain, a shorter recovery time, shorter hospitalization and a better cosmetic result."
CD009323,0,1534496,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a private community setting.,"In order to evaluate early results and safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in community hospitals, the charts of 380 consecutive patients, scheduled between February 8 and November 28, 1990, were reviewed. There were 294 women and 86 men, with a mean age of 48 years. Forty-one patients required conversion to open cholecystectomy, for reasons including adhesions in 18 patients, intraductal filling defects in 11, marked inflammation in 6, excessive bleeding in 3, poor visualization of the operative field in 2, and gangrenous gallbladder in 1. Hospital stay (excluding patients converted to laparotomy) ranged from 0.29-18 days, with a mean of 1.4 days. Operative time ranged from 29-280 min, with a mean of 114 min. Cystic duct operative cholangiography was performed in 71% of patients. In 29%, operative cholangiography was either not performed at all or was attempted and unsuccessful, due to inability to cannulate the cystic duct. Procedure-related morbidity was 2.6%, which includes three common bile duct injuries, three intraabdominal abscesses requiring drainage, and one pneumonia. There was one death resulting from respiratory failure. Our results compare favorably with those reported in the literature. We conclude that laparoscopic cholecystectomy in community hospitals is a safe procedure in properly selected patients."
CD009323,0,1534492,0,A new technique of laparoscopic cholangiography.,"With the advent and rapid proliferation of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, numerous techniques and ""tips"" have been described. Intraoperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be tedious, frustrating, and time consuming. Described herein is a technique of intraoperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy which has proven to be easy, fast, and succinct. This method utilizes a rigid cholangiogram catheter which is placed into the peritoneal cavity through a small additional puncture site. This catheter is easily inserted into the cystic duct by extracorporeal manipulation. We suggest this method to surgeons who have shared our prior frustration with intraoperative cholangiography."
CD009323,0,1534489,0,Percutaneous surgery of biliary cyst: a case report.,"Biliary cysts are uncommon and often asymptomatic. Once symptoms occur, treatment is needed. Though percutaneous drainage is possible, the recurrence rate is high. Open drainage is associated with the morbidity of laparotomy. We report a case of laparoscopic treatment of a large biliary cyst."
CD009323,0,1386227,0,[Anatomo-surgical considerations in laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,"The Authors emphasize the importance of a perfect anatomo-surgical knowledge for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therefore, the anatomic structures of the region are taken into account from a ""laparoscopic"" point of view, with great care to accessory bile duct, hepatic artery, and cystic artery. Knowledge and confidence with the anatomy of the region are essential to identify abnormal structures and subsequently switch from a laparoscopic to a laparotomic approach."
CD009323,0,1374280,0,Laparoscopy in the management of pancreatic cancer: endoscopic cholecystojejunostomy for advanced disease.,"Following a period of animal experimentation in pigs, a laparoscopic technique for sutured gastrointestinal and bilioenteric anastomoses was developed and its safety and efficacy tested in chronic experiments. The method involves the construction of a preformed external jamming loop knot and continuous suturing using a specially developed Endoski needle. The technique was used to construct a cholecystojejunostomy in five patients with advanced cancer of the pancreas (four hand-sutured and one stapled/sutured). Four of the patients recovered from the procedure with no complications, minimal postoperative discomfort and complete relief of their jaundice. In one patient relief of jaundice was slow due to blockage of the anastomosis by debris and blood clot; this resolved following removal of the inspissated material. This minimally invasive procedure has the potential for complete palliation with short hospital stay and avoids the hazards of endoscopic stenting such as encrustation and cholangitis."

CD009323,0,1531915,0,Laparoscopic cholangiography. Results and indications.,"One hundred sixty-five operative cholangiograms were attempted in 364 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (45%). Laparoscopic cholangiography was successful in 150 of 165 attempts (91%). Eighty-nine per cent of studies were normal (134/150) and 11% were abnormal (16/150). All 134 patients with normal cholangiograms remained asymptomatic (false-negative rate, 0%). False-positive studies occurred in 3 of 150 (2%) total cholangiograms and 3 of 12 (25%) abnormal cholangiograms consistent with choledocholithiasis. A total of 16 of 364 patients had proven common bile duct stones (4.4%). Eight of the sixteen stones were removed by preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography/sphincterotomy. Five of sixteen stones were found at cholangiography, four of which were unsuspected (4/150, 2.6%). Retained common duct stones were found in 3 of 214 patients not undergoing cholangiography (1.4%). No complications or deaths occurred that were due to cholangiography. One biliary injury occurred (1/364, 0.3%), in a patient with aberrant anatomy who did not undergo cholangiography. Laparoscopic cholangiography is a safe technique with a success rate greater than 90%. Routine cholangiography is presently recommended for prevention of biliary injury, detection of stones in the cystic and common ducts, and for training purposes, especially during the learning phase of laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,1531913,0,Mechanisms of major biliary injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the procedure of choice for surgical removal of the gallbladder. The most significant complication of this new technique is injury to the bile duct. Twelve cases of bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy were reviewed. Eight injuries were of a classic type: misidentification of the common duct for the cystic duct, resection of part of the common and hepatic ducts, and associated right hepatic arterial injury. Another injury was similar: clip ligation of the distal common duct with proximal ligation and division of the cystic duct, resulting in biliary obstruction and leakage. Three complications arose from excessive use of cautery or laser in the region of the common duct, resulting in biliary strictures. Evaluation of persistent diffuse abdominal pain led to the recognition of ductal injury in most patients. Ultimately, 10 patients required a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy to provide adequate biliary drainage. One patient had a successful direct common duct repair, and the remaining patient underwent endoscopic dilatation."
CD009323,0,1341493,0,Bile duct injury in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Bile duct injury is an unusual complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Although the exact incidence is yet to be determined, it does appear to be more common than bile duct injury during open cholecystectomy. Previous publications have attempted to document the incidence of bile duct injuries and methods to prevent it. We reviewed our experience with 11 bile duct injuries from laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Such injuries were manifested by abdominal pain, low-grade fever, and hyperbilirubinemia or biliary fistula. These patients' injuries were treated by using drainage or reexploration and ligation of cystic duct and subcholecystic duct leaks and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy for common duct strictures and lacerations."
CD009323,0,1532295,0,Electrosurgical laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Though laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become widespread, questions remain as to its success rate, its role in acute cholecystitis, the role of cholangiography, and whether laser use is necessary. To attempt to answer these questions, the first 100 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy at Emory University using electrosurgical diathermy were reviewed. Patients underwent cholecystectomy for biliary colic (87), gallstone pancreatitis (1), and acute cholecystitis (12). The average length of hospital stay was 29 hours (range: 12 hours to 5 days). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was not possible in 7 patients because of gangrenous cholecystitis (2), adhesions from previous surgery (2), equipment failure (2), and choledochoduodenal fistula found at surgery (1). Two patients developed bile leaks from accessory bile ducts that healed spontaneously. There were no other complications. The average time required to complete the laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 115 minutes (range: 45 to 238 minutes) and was not significantly different in those patients undergoing intraoperative cholangiography (117 minutes) versus those without (109 minutes). Common duct stones were uncommon in this series. Thirty-three patients underwent intraoperative cholangiogram. One patient was found to have a common duct stone, which was pushed into the duodenum using a Fogarty catheter (American Edwards Laboratories; Anasco, Puerto Rico) inserted through the cystic duct at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Twelve patients with acute cholecystitis underwent an attempt at laparoscopic cholecystectomy that was successful in nine. These procedures were difficult and lengthy (mean of 143 minutes). Causes for failure were gangrenous cholecystitis (2) and equipment failure (1). In conclusion, laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed with a high success rate (93%) and low morbidity (2%). No complications seemed attributable to electrosurgical dissection."
CD009323,0,1531442,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and choledocholithiasis.,"Between November 1990 and March 1991, five patients with cholelithiasis and associated choledocholithiasis were treated by laparoscopic cholecystectomy and common-bile-duct exploration (CBDE). Three patients had a successful CBDE, but in two common-bile-duct stones had to be extracted surgically. Two patients had formal laparoscopic CBDE, and three patients had CBDE performed through the cystic duct. All patients recovered from surgery without complication. Laparoscopic CBDE is difficult to perform because of lack of adequate instrumentation and limited experience. Although the authors do not recommend that this procedure be performed widely at present, they believe it will eventually replace many open CBDEs. The authors review the pertinent literature and evaluate diagnostic means for preoperative and peroperative detection of choledocholithiasis. They discuss the alternatives to laparoscopic CBDE, their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, they summarize their own policy with respect to laparoscopic CBDE."
CD009323,0,1531273,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and choledochoscopy for the treatment of cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis.,"A 33-year-old woman with symptomatic cholelithiasis underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Preoperative evaluation did not suggest the presence of choledocholithiasis, but intraoperative cholangiography showed a totally obstructing stone in the distal common bile duct. Laparoscopically directed, transperitoneal choledochoscopy was performed by passing a 9.4 F flexible ureteroscope through the cystic duct into the distal common bile duct. A single calculus was visualized and removed with a basket. The patient was discharged the next day, returned to full activity within 1 week, and has done well in the subsequent postoperative interval. The management of incidentally discovered common bile duct stones during performance of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is discussed."
CD009323,0,1364212,0,Endoscopic approaches in the diagnosis of obstructive jaundice--with special reference to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.,"Duodenofiberscopy with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed in 102 patients with obstructive jaundice. Peritoneoscopy and peritoneoscopic cholecystocholangiography were done in patients whose ERCP was inconclusive. The causes of obstructive jaundice were carcinoma of the pancreas in 14 cases, carcinoma of the papilla of Vater in 12 cases, choledocholithiasis in 37 cases, carcinoma of the common bile duct in seven cases, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in seven cases, intrahepatic cholestasis in three cases and miscellaneous causes in eight cases. No final diagnosis was made in 14 patients. The duodenofiberscopic examination with biopsy revealed the cause of obstructive jaundice directly in eight cases, when carcinoma of the pancreas or papilla of Vater extended to the duodenal mucosal surface. In 34 of the 37 patients with choledocholithiasis, ERCP alone was successful in making the diagnosis. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and ERCP were used together to reach a diagnosis in the remaining three patients. We propose a classification for HCC on ERCP which may be useful for the study of icteric type HCC."
CD009323,0,1728064,0,Cystic duct remnant fistulization to the gastrointestinal tract.,"Cystic duct remnant (CDR)-enteric fistulization is a rare entity, with only four recorded cases in the literature. CDRs can be found in at least 30% of patients after cholecystectomy and have been reported in as many as 83% of these patients. Calculous obstruction of the CDR or the common bile duct in a patient with a CDR must be present for fistulization to occur. Patients with a CDR-enteric fistula will have biliary tract symptoms after cholecystectomy and may have biliary sepsis. The septic episode or cholangitis may and can resolve when the CDR decompresses through the fistula. In a patient with persistent biliary tract symptoms, CDR should be considered as a possible cause, and common bile duct stones are often associated with CDRs. Signs of systemic infection in patients with biliary symptoms after cholecystectomy may indicate CDR fistulization. If a CDR is suspected, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is the diagnostic and potentially therapeutic test of choice. If the patient cannot be successfully treated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or has recurrent symptoms, operative therapy is indicated, including division of the fistula, excision of the CDR, and common bile duct exploration. There may be an increase in the number of complications associated with CDRs, considering the increasing frequency of laparoscopic cholecystectomy resulting in more lengthy CDRs."
CD009323,0,1557348,0,Diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. Imaging techniques and tumor markers.,"In view of the increasing number of new imaging techniques and serum tumor markers, it is not well established which combination or which order of tests may provide the most information for diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. This review determines the diagnostic value of the various tests and evaluates which combination of tests may provide the most information and what may be considered to be a current rational approach to the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. In the present analysis endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) provided a 92% sensitivity that exceeded the 83% and 74% sensitivities calculated for computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound, respectively. The specificity of all three imaging techniques exceeded 90%. Serum determination of CA 19-9 yielded an 83% sensitivity, which was considerably higher than sensitivities of carcinoembryonic antigen and various other tumor markers. The combination of CA 19-9 and ultrasound improved the sensitivity of each test performed alone by 10-15%. Fine-needle biopsy allows diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma with a sensitivity of 83% and an almost perfect specificity of 99%. On the basis of these data, the combination of ultrasound and determination of CA 19-9 is recommended as the initial tests when pancreatic carcinoma is suspected. CT also must be performed if ultrasound is indeterminant or inconsistent with the clinical evaluation, as well as in patients with negative ultrasound but abnormal CA 19-9. Negative results of CT, ultrasound, and CA 19-9 will exclude pancreatic carcinoma in most patients. A positive ultrasound or CT result usually leads to fine-needle biopsy, which helps avoid most diagnostic laparotomies. ERCP must be performed in patients where ultrasound, CT, and fine-needle biopsy do not clarify the diagnosis. In the majority of patients with pancreatic carcinoma, noninvasive imaging techniques such as ultrasound and CT also allow adequate staging. In some patients, however, laparoscopy and angiography may need to be performed for strategic planning of further therapy. Although modern imaging techniques and serum tumor markers allow diagnosis of pancreatic carcinomas as small as 2-3 cm and help avoid most diagnostic laparotomies, this improvement in diagnostic capability has as yet not significantly improved the prognosis."
CD009323,0,1531107,0,Laparoscopic transcystic common bile duct exploration.,"This study reviews the results of transcystic common bile duct exploration (CBDE) for unsuspected stones found during laparoscopic cholecystectomy by a single surgeon in 150 consecutive patients. Fluoroscopic cholangiography was attempted in all but four patients. If the cholangiogram appeared to show common bile duct (CBD) stones, a 5 Fr, 8-mm ureteral stone basket was passed through the cystic duct into the duodenum, opened, and trolled through the CBD. Routine cholangiography was successful in 131 of 144 attempts (90%). An indication for CBDE was found by cholangiogram in seven patients (5%). Two cholangiograms were falsely positive. Stones were removed in five patients. Completion cholangiograms were normal in all patients. One patient developed mild pancreatitis but was discharged 2 days after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The remainder were discharged on postoperative day 1. One patient was readmitted on postoperative day 2, possibly having passed a retained stone. Fluoroscopic CBDE was successful in clearing the CBD in all patients in this small series and deserves further evaluation."
CD009323,0,1531004,0,Curative resection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Results of a 10-year prospective study.,"Since 1980, 73 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) without radiographic evidence of liver metastases were studied on a prospective protocol including medical management of gastric acid hypersecretion, extensive radiographic tumor localization, and exploratory surgery to find and resect gastrinoma for potential cure. Each patient had gastric acid hypersecretion effectively controlled with either H2-blockers or omeprazole. Patients were divided prospectively into two groups, with all patients undergoing the same preoperative localization studies and extensive laparotomy. In contrast to group 1 (1980-1986) (36 patients), group 2 (1987-Oct. 1990) (37 patients) also underwent additional procedures (transillumination and duodenotomy) at surgery to find duodenal gastrinomas. Preoperative imaging studies localized tumor in 38 (52%) patients, and portal venous sampling for gastrin determinations was positive in 49 (67%) patients. Gastrinomas were found and resected in 57 (78%) patients. Significantly more gastrinomas (92% of patients) were found in group 2 than in group 1 patients (64%) (p less than 0.01). This increase was due to increased numbers of duodenal gastrinomas in group 2 than in group 1 patients (43% versus 11%; p less than 0.01). The increased ability to find duodenal gastrinomas did not significantly improve the immediate disease-free rate, which was 58% for all patients. Duodenal primary gastrinomas were found to have a significantly greater incidence of metastases (55%) and a significantly shorter disease-free interval (12 months) than pancreatic gastrinomas (22% and 84 months, respectively) suggesting that duodenal gastrinomas may be more malignant and not more frequently curable than pancreatic gastrinomas. Operations were performed with no deaths and 11% morbidity rate. Long-term follow-up showed that 50% of patients initially rendered disease free would develop recurrent disease by 5 years. Survival was excellent for all patients, and none died of malignant spread of the tumor or uncontrolled peptic ulcer disease, with a mean follow-up of 5 years. This finding is in contrast to patients who presented with metastatic disease on imaging studies and had a 20% 5-year survival rate. This study suggests that all patients with localized sporadic ZES can have the gastric acid hypersecretion managed medically, that overall survival of these patients is excellent, most (78%) can have all gastrinoma found and resected, and some (30%) will be cured (long-term disease-free survival)."
CD009323,0,1453630,0,[Laparoscopy in the diagnosis of abdominal diseases in children].,"The results of laparoscopy performed in 1988-1990 in 112 children with tumours and cysts of the abdominal cavity, with diseases of the liver and bile ducts are presented. Of them in 60%, the puncture biopsy was performed. Use of laparoscopy in 64.28% of the sufferers with closed abdominal trauma permitted to avoid performance of needless laparotomy. For suspected acute appendicitis, laparoscopy was performed in 80 patients: in 36 of them, no signs of the disease were revealed, in 14--other diseases were detected, in 30--diagnosis was confirmed. A high informative value of the given method in the diagnosis of abdominal diseases in children was noted."
CD009323,0,1439564,0,Laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery.,"The growth and scope of laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery are outstripping the ability of medical journals to print series and reports of experience, and much data remain anectodal and preliminary. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become established, although, unfortunately, peroperative cholangiography has not yet become normal practice, despite convincing published evidence that it is likely to reduce the increased number of bile ducts that are damaged by laparoscopic surgeons. Imaging the bile ducts and the overall management of choledocholithiasis need re-evaluation, and the approach will change as more surgeons explore the bile ducts laparoscopically. Laparoscopic hiatal anti-reflux surgery will soon be routine, and a whole range of laparoscopically assisted operations on the oesophagus, colon, and rectum will become commonplace. Operations on the liver remain anecdotal. Throughout this rapid progress, surgeons must not forget the principles of (open) surgical practice, whilst carefully kept registers and regular audit of operations will provide new surgical standards."
CD009323,0,1387115,0,Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now the standard approach to gallbladder disease. While laparoscopic cholecystectomy offers many advantages over the conventional laparotomy procedure one of its drawbacks is that a synchronous common bile duct exploration, for so long a cornerstone of management of choledocholithiasis, is not yet widely practised laparoscopically. Endoscopic sphincterotomy or open surgery, with their attendant hazards and morbidity, remain the most common approaches. A flexible choledochoscope with an operating channel may in future facilitate laparoscopic management of choledocholithiasis but as yet this is not widely available. We report the removal of a common duct stone by dormia basket extraction through the cystic duct at laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,1386169,0,[The cystic duct stump after laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the length of cystic-duct stumps after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 113 patients underwent intravenous cholangiography 2 to 3 months postoperatively, whereby a cystic-duct remnant of up to 1 cm was found in 34.5% (n = 39) and between 1 and 2 cm in 36.3% (n = 41). In 24.8% (n = 28) a stump measuring 2 to 3 cm was registered and in 4.4% (n = 5) the cystic-duct remnant was more than 3 cm. Possible consequences with regard to the development of the postcholecystectomy syndrome are discussed. In our experience laparoscopic cholangiography seems to be a useful procedure to detect cysticolithiasis and as preliminary measure to undertaking the correct therapeutic steps. Adherence of this strategy might avoid possible later complications by elimination of their principal cause."
CD009323,0,1385601,0,[Laparoscopic hysterectomy. Results in 44 cases].,"Laparoscopic hysterectomy is a recent procedure. We present our preliminary results about 44 patients. In 77.3% of cases (34 patients) the operation was carried out completely by laparoscopy and 10 patients (22.7%) required conversion of the laparoscopy to a standard laparotomy. The indications for laparotomy were: hemostasis difficulties (6 cases); bladder injury (1 case); inability to expose the uterine pedicles and or the ureter (3 cases). Three post-operative complications occurred: one small bowel occlusion which was explored by laparoscopy, and two infection treated by antibiotics only. These preliminary results enable us: to affirm that laparoscopic hysterectomy is feasibility without an important risk of per and or post-operative complications. to specify the four situations in which laparoscopic surgery is particularly advantageous for hysterectomy: absence of genital prolapse; when uni or bilateral adnexectomy is required; previous past-history of abdomino-pelvic surgery, salpingitis, endometriosis ...; neoplastic pathologies (lymphadenectomy); to propose a laparoscopic hysterectomy classification."
CD009323,0,1344788,0,[Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Apropos of 450 cases].,"450 successive celioscopic cholecystectomies (May, 1990-April, 1992) are reported for 312 cases of uncomplicated gallstone (69%) operated electively and 138 cases operated in emergency, including 120 cases of acute cholecystitis, 17 cases of biliary pancreatitis and 1 case of angiocholitis. Immediate conversion into laparotomy was required in 10 cases (2.2%) either for technical reasons (1.1%) or because of lithiasis of the common bile duct (1.1%). The stay in hospital lasted an average of 2.2% days for elective admission and 3.3 days for emergent admission. The average operating time was 65 minutes (75 minutes until May, 1991, and 55 minutes between May, 1991 and April, 1992). Preoperative retrograde cholangiography was performed in 67 cases and intraoperative cholangiography in 16 cases. Second surgery was required for suture in one case because of cholerrhagia in a secondary duct of the gallbladder bed. This cholerrhagia would not have been amenable to simple aspiration. One patient (0.2%) died of myocardial infarction at D + 10. Complications include 4 cases of pulmonary embolism, 3 cases of cystic biliary fistula without second surgery and 4 cases of umbilical hernia. A more peculiar case is that of a patient admitted 5 months after surgery for gangrenous acute cholecystitis. This patient was admitted for fever and epigrastric pain. He had a very low-flow duodenocutaneous fistula of uncertain origin. This patient was not operated again. This may not be a complication connected to celioscopic surgery. Celioscopic cholecystectomy is superseding conventional cholecystectomy. Surgeons' efforts should strive at eliminating operative errors, reducing postoperative morbidity, improving techniques and instruments, teaching celioscopic surgery and extending its indications to other intraabdominal operations."
CD009323,0,1344577,0,Bile leak after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has now become the preferred surgical approach to symptomatic cholelithiasis. With the widespread use of this technique there have appeared reports of complications. We report the case of a patient who developed a cystic duct stump bile leak after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Percutaneous drainage of the biloma, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and papillotomy led to resolution of the problem. The literature on cystic duct stump leaks after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is reviewed and the various therapeutic modalities are outlined."
CD009323,0,1344571,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy combined with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction or laparoscopic choledochoscopy and electrohydraulic lithotripsy for management of cholelithiasis with choledocholithiasis.,"Six hundred twenty-two laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed at St. Vincent Hospital over a 14-month period. We reviewed the records of 366 of these patients who were referred to the authors. Thirty-six patients had suspected choledocholithiasis. The primary author (M.E.A.) performed 38 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCPs) on these patients for diagnosis and management. Seventeen of the 36 patients had common bile duct stones; 19 patients had negative studies. Of the 17 patients with choledocholithiasis, 15 had successful cannulation of the common bile duct, and, of these, 10 underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy plus endoscopic sphincterotomy and extraction of the common duct stone(s). In one high-risk elderly patient, we extracted the stone from the common duct and left the gallbladder in situ. Two patients failed endoscopic cannulation and underwent open cholecystectomy with common bile duct exploration. Four additional patients, cannulated successfully, had unsuccessful endoscopic stone removal because the stones were too large or were impacted. Two of these patients underwent open cholecystectomy and common duct exploration. The two other patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and choledochoscopy through the cystic duct with the flexible choledochoscope. An electrohydraulic lithotripsy probe was then inserted through the choledochoscope to fragment the stones, and stone fragments were allowed to pass through the previously created sphincterotomy. We believe our data, supported by data in the literature, show that these alternative methods for treating choledocholithiasis are safe and effective and should be considered primary modalities for treating this condition now that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for cholelithiasis."
CD009323,0,1339727,0,[Biliary cysts. Resection of the protruding dome using celioscopy].,"After giving the highlights on the few surgical indications of biliary cysts, the authors present a film of the resection of the protruding dome with celioscopy for an 80-mm cyst of the 3rd segment of the liver, in association with cholecystectomy for lithiasis. The simple technique and uncomplicated postoperative period emphasize the merits of this procedure, although this should not lead to inappropriate indications."
CD009323,0,1339725,0,[Peroperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,"The aim of this study was to assess the ease and the success of a laparoscopic technique of cholangiography. Following an initial period of training to gain expertise in laparoscopic surgery, 70 patients were included in the study. Six of them had a history of suggestive choledocholithiasis. Intraoperative cholangiography was performed using an angled catheter (Judkins) and a specific tubular cannula (Olsen, Storz) designed to guide and maintain the catheter in the cystic duct. Catheterization of the cystic duct and cholangiography were achieved in 61 patients. In 3 cases, stones were found in the common bile duct. The mean duration of the examination was 11 minutes (6.21). Cholecystectomy was performed after cholangiography. No biliary injuries were observed. These results show that intraoperative laparoscopic cholangiography is easy and not time-consuming. It obviates the need for preoperative investigations looking for biliary stones and provides an excellent definition of the biliary anatomy for safety purposes."
CD009323,0,1306433,0,[Complications of cholecystectomy by laparoscopic approach. Apropos of 6512 cases].,"6,512 laparoscopic cholecystectomies have been performed by 141 surgeons. The lithiasis was uncomplicated in 80% of cases. Conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy was necessary in 350 cases (5.37%), for technical problems (22 cases), complications (87 cases) or surgical difficulties (241 cases): 107 cholecystitis, 68 adhesions, 14 difficulties in finding the cystic duct and 25 common bile duct stones were the principle surgical difficulties. Among the 304 complications, we have observed 35 general and 251 local complications: 58 haemorrhages, 12 common bile duct lesions (10 cases of iatrogenic trauma and 2 accidental ligations), 4 cystic duct problems and 3 cases of intestinal trauma were the principle per-laparoscopic complications. Among the 164 post-laparoscopies cholecystectomy's complications, we have observed 50 biliary fistulae with 32 requiring further surgery (damage to the common bile duct in 14 cases), 3 common bile duct strictures, 20 haemorrhages (7 requiring further surgery), 31 deep or sub-phrenic abscesses (16 requiring further surgery) and 2 peritonitis after intestinal trauma. We have had 7 deaths (0.10%). Prognostic factors are: 1) The degree of surgeon's experience; the first 50 laparoscopies cholecystectomies performed are more likely to require further surgery (P < 0.05). 2) Cholecystitis with an significantly higher rate of conversion to laparotomy (P < 0.001) and morbidity (P < 0.01). For an experienced surgeon the biliary morbidity is near to that observed in classical cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,1296230,0,Nonsurgical management of gallstones.,"Nonsurgical management of gallstones has made considerable progress within the past 20 years. More than 95% of all patients with bile duct stones can be treated successfully by peroral endoscopic or percutaneous techniques. In the case of very large or impacted calculi, intracorporeal or extracorporeal lithotripsy is available (Figure 9-10). Mortality from these approaches is low (in the range of 1%) despite the fact that most patients are elderly and frail, and open surgery is rarely required. While nonsurgical management of bile duct stones is commonly accepted, there is disagreement as to whether gallbladder stones should be managed nonsurgically, especially in view of the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. For patients in good general health who are willing to undergo surgery, removal of the gallbladder is the treatment of choice. However, there are some patients in whom a nonsurgical procedure ought to be considered. These are patients with a patent cystic duct, a functioning gallbladder, and symptomatic, radiolucent stones who can be scheduled for elective treatment. In patients with small floating stones, solitary radiolucent stones or even multiple large stones with a CT density lower than 50 HU, the chance of complete clearance of the gallbladder ranges between 80% and 90% using oral dissolution therapy, direct contact dissolution, or a combination of extracorporeal lithotripsy and dissolution. Each method has its ideal candidates (Table 9-1). The overall percentage of patients with gallstones for these nonsurgical therapeutic options is probably not higher than 20%. Therefore, the impact on surgery is still minor. Controlled clinical comparisons of the different therapies are lacking at the moment. However, these approaches have already stimulated further research into the pathogenesis of gallbladder stone disease and will no doubt undergo further improvement. Drugs that, in addition to ursodeoxycholic acid, further reduce cholesterol saturation in bile such as 3-hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are already under investigation for oral treatment of gallstones in combination with bile acids. Further studies will also clarify the influence of gallbladder motility and certain bile constituents, such as proteins, on clearance of gallstones and recurrence after successful nonsurgical management. Thus, nonsurgical options, which obviate the necessity for general anesthesia and eliminate the risk of bile duct injury, will certainly continue to play a role in the management of gallbladder stones."
CD009323,0,1292590,0,Acute calculous cholecystitis. What is new in diagnosis and therapy?,"The management of patients with acute calculous cholecystitis has changed during recent years. The etiology of acute cholecystitis is still not fully understood. Infection of bile is relatively unimportant since bile and gallbladder wall cultures are sterile in many patients with acute cholecystitis. Ultrasonography is first choice for diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and cholescintigraphy is second best. Percutaneous puncture of the gallbladder that can be used for therapeutic drainage has also diagnostic qualities. Early cholecystectomy under antibiotic prophylaxis is the treatment of choice, and has been shown to be superior to delayed surgery in several prospective trials. Mortality can be as low as 0.5% in patients younger than 70-80 years of age, but a high mortality has been reported in octogenerians. Selective intraoperative cholangiography is now generally accepted and no advantage of routine cholangiography was shown in clinical trials. Percutaneous cholecystostomy can be successfully performed under ultrasound guidance and has a place in the treatment of severely ill patients with acute cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be done safely in patients with acute cholecystitis, but extensive experience with this technique is necessary. Endoscopic retrograde drainage of the gallbladder by introduction of a catheter in the cystic duct is feasible but data are still scarce."
CD009323,0,1839431,0,[Endoscopic surgery of the digestive system: state of the art. Opinion of an endoscopic surgeon].,"The Authors review the possible applications of surgical endoscopy in oesophageal, gastric, biliary, pancreatic and colic diseases. This critical assessment, performed under the abdominal endoscopic surgeon's point of view, is based on the overall experience of about 20 years of surgery, with particular regard to the sclerosis of oesophageal varices, neoplastic obstructions of oesophagus, biliary tract, colon and localized Laser treatment of neoplasms. Based on the results achieved, thanks to selective indications and monitoring by conventional surgical experience, the Authors conclude by staging a better reliability of the surgeon who performs surgical endoscopy to obtain good results after an accurate selection of those cases which can really benefit from endoscopic management."
CD009323,0,1838942,0,Carcinoma of the gallbladder found during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a case report and review of the literature.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become an accepted appropriate method for removal of the diseased gallbladder. With cancer of the gallbladder to be expected in 1-2% of all biliary tract operations, it is likely that surgeons may be confronted with the unsuspected finding of gallbladder carcinoma during the course of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We present here a case of gallbladder carcinoma found at laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and discuss the interesting clinical findings associated with this entity, including the preoperative suggestion of Trousseau's syndrome. A review of the pertinent literature is included."
CD009323,0,1838940,0,Laparoscopic exploration of the common bile duct: experience in 16 selected patients.,"The authors' initial experience with transcystic duct and direct laparoscopic approaches to the exploration of the common bile duct is reported. The technique requires standard laparoscopic equipment, specialized endoscopes, and instruments developed for urologic stone manipulations. After cholangiography confirmed the presence of common bile duct stones, common duct stone extraction was performed in 16 selected patients age 20-88 years. Stones ranged in size from 1 mm to 30 mm and they were unsuspected in 60% of the patients. Five patients had normal liver function tests and only 3 had clinical evidence of jaundice. Ductal exploration and stone extraction was successful in all 16 patients. One patient required a direct laparoscopic ductal exploration due to the presence of a common hepatic duct stone and the anatomy of the cystic duct. No major complications or deaths were observed in this series. Appropriately trained surgeons can safely and effectively perform laparoscopic common bile duct exploration and stone extraction in selected patients."
CD009323,0,1670228,0,Results of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a university hospital.,"This study analyzed the first 100 laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed at a university teaching hospital by a single surgeon. Patients presented with chronic cholecystitis (92), acute cholecystitis (5), acalculus cholecystitis (2), and asymptomatic cholelithiasis (1). The operative time ranged from 59 minutes to 185 minutes (mean: 110 minutes). Cholangiography was performed in 88 patients, and common bile duct stones were discovered in 3. Choledocholithiasis was managed successfully through the cystic duct in all cases. Two procedures were converted to open cholecystectomy. Operative complications included ductal injury in one patient, bile leak in two, wound cellulitis in four, and atelectasis in one. Ninety-seven patients were released within 24 hours after surgery. Mean hospital charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were $828 less than the cost incurred for open cholecystectomy. These early results support the view that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe, cost-effective method for performing cholecystectomy with a remarkable improvement in patient recovery time."
CD009323,0,1835552,0,[Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The first 45 operations].,"During a period of 13 weeks, 45 patients with symptom-producing gall bladder stones (attacks of gall stone colic n = 39 (87%); acute cholecystitis n = 6 (13%)), corresponding to approximately 85% of the total number of gall bladder stone patients during the period were selected for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Two patients had previously undergone upper abdominal operations and had adhesions and one patient suffered from cirrhosis of the liver with portal hypertension. It proved necessary to convert five of the laparoscopic cholecystectomies to open cholecystectomies (11%) on account of technical difficulties (severe acute changes due to cholecystitis (n = 3), indeterminable anatomical conditions (n = 1) and one case of liver metastases (n = 1)). The median duration of operation was 90 minutes with a range from 30 to 360 minutes. Peroperative cholangiography was not undertaken routinely. No cases of forgotten stones in the common bile duct occurred. No deaths occurred and, in all, three slight complications occurred (7%): two patients had haematoma in the abdominal wall and one patient minimal leakage of bile from the stump of the gall bladder on account of insufficient ligation of the cystic duct. This patient was treated with an endoscopically placed drain in the common bile duct for two weeks, after which she was well. No lesions of the common bile duct occurred. None of the complications required laparotomy. The median duration of hospitalization was 24 hours with a range from one to 14 days. All of the patients were at work or could manage their usual activities after 14 days. The median duration of sick leave was seven days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009323,0,1835346,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Experience with 375 consecutive patients.,"Three hundred seventy-five consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy from September 1989 to January 1991. Three hundred forty-one (91%) presented on an elective basis, and the remaining 34 patients (9%) were admitted for acute cholecystitis (24), gallstone pancreatitis (9), and cholangitis (1). Of the 375 patients, 20 were converted to laparotomy and cholecystectomy, for an overall success rate of 95% for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Three hundred nineteen patients (90%) were discharged within 24 hours of surgery. Operative cholangiography was completed in 141 patients, showing choledocholithiasis in five (managed by postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP] in 4, common bile duct exploration [CBDE] in 1). Two retained stones (0.9%) were detected in 214 patients not undergoing cholangiography. Three patients (0.8%) were reoperated on because of perioperative complications. Overall morbidity for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 3.5%. Major complications (0.6%) included a single common hepatic duct injury and a delayed cystic duct leak at 10 days. Minor complications occurred in 11 patients (2.9%). The single perioperative death (0.3%) was due to a myocardial infarction on postoperative day 3, after an otherwise uncomplicated laparoscopic procedure. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to offer significant advantages to patient recovery, and these data suggest that it can be performed with an efficacy, morbidity rate, and mortality rate similar to those of open cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,1833848,0,Complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"As laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become more widely practiced, the full spectrum of complications associated with this technique is being realized. We have performed 283 consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies with no deaths and a morbidity rate of 5.3% (15 of 283 patients; six major complications, nine minor complications). Major complications included one bile duct injury requiring laparotomy and t-tube insertion and two patients with retained stones. Symptomatic bile leakage occurred in three patients (1%). Two of these bile leaks were from accessory ducts entering the gallbladder bed; the third leak was secondary to a cystic duct leak. Eight patients (2.8%) required conversion to open cholecystectomy. Minor complications included three patients with subumbilical wound infections, two patients with urinary tract infections, one patient with costochondritis after operation, and three patients with prolonged hospital stays (more than 48 hrs) caused by ileus or fever. Several patients with life-threatening complications, including two patients who ultimately died, were transferred to our care from other centers. These included two patients with common duct injuries combined with duodenal perforations (one of whom died), one patient with a complete common duct transection, one patient with major common hepatic duct injury, and two patients with further instances of bile leakage. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely, and it can be associated with life-threatening complications. Prevention of complications is dependent on proper patient selection, meticulous technique, and an accepting attitude toward conversion to ""open"" cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,1837543,0,Endoscopic management of common duct stones with laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"In the first year from October 1990 since starting the procedure 65 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were carried out on one surgical service. There were 4 planned open cholecystectomies and 8 laparoscopic procedures converted during the same period: 7 of these were in the first 3 months with only 1 of the last 53 being opened. Surgery was carried out during the same admission in 22 patients presenting as emergencies: acute cholecystitis (9), colic (6), pancreatitis (3), jaundice (4). Two patients had later laparotomies for complications; one patient bled from the umbilical stab and with ongoing peritonism had a pelvic haematoma drained on day 5 and a second was opened following a bile leak caused by a displaced cystic duct clip--both recovered uneventfully. Peroperative cholangiography was performed in 13 patients; 2 were positive (15%) and had ERCP papillotomy 3 days post op without complication. One patient who presented with pancreatitis had ERCP performed post-op without incident. Seven patients had laparoscopic cholecystectomy following papillotomy for common duct stones. The gallbladder was extracted per umbilicus in 45 (3 wound infections) and per right subcostal stab in 20 (no infections). Mean hospital stay was 48 hours (1-4 days) in uncomplicated cases. In conclusion, the learning curve is associated with higher conversion rates. Extraction through pliable hypochondrial muscles is easier and may be safer and less traumatic. Perioperative endoscopic papillotomy is safe and effective for choledochal stones."
CD009323,0,1688289,0,Minimally invasive colon resection (laparoscopic colectomy).,"The successful application of laparoscopic surgery to gallbladder disease and acute appendicitis has encouraged clinical investigators to develop this technology further in an attempt to manage other pathologic disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. After gaining experience with various laparoscopic skills while performing clinical biliary tract surgery, appendectomy and then in a controlled animal laboratory, a pilot program for laparoscopic colonic surgery was initiated. Twenty patients with ages ranging from 43 to 88 years (mean age of 57 years) underwent laparoscope-assisted colon resection. In nine patients, a right hemicolectomy was performed and a sigmoid colectomy in eight. A low anterior resection, Hartman's procedure, and abdominal perineal resection were each performed in one patient. Indications for surgery were large villous adenomas or adenocarcinoma in 12, diverticular disease in 5, sigmoid endometrioma in 1, cecal volvulus in 1, and inflammatory bowel disease in 1. Eighty percent of patients were able to tolerate a liquid diet on the first postoperative day and 70% were discharged within 96 h eating a regular diet and having normal bowel movements. There were three operative complications: a 3 unit postoperative bleed managed without surgery, one patient developed marked edema of the rectosigmoid anastomosis requiring decompression with a rectal tube, and one individual with metastatic colon cancer was operated on for a mechanical small bowel obstruction 7 days after the initial laparoscopic surgery. Although laparoscope-assisted colonic surgery may still be considered a procedure in evolution, we feel that in time it has the potential to be as popular as laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,1683393,0,[Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: the first 50 patients].,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has rapidly gained wide acceptance in the United States. The applicability, safety and efficacy of this new procedure for the treatment of cholelithiasis in Taiwan, however, needs evaluation. We performed LC in 50 out of 98 cases of cholelithiasis at Cathay General Hospital from 28 December 1990 to 28 April 1991. We found that the applicability rate was 51%. The reasons for not selecting LC in the 48 open cases were: acute and gangrenous cholecystitis (13), common bile duct stones (11), concomitant intra-abdominal malignancy (5), intrahepatic stones (5), multiple upper abdominal incisions (4), pancreatitis or pancreatic abscesses (3) and other causes (7). In the LC group, there were 44 patients with symptomatic chronic calculus cholecystitis, 3 patients with acute calculus cholecystitis and 3 patients with gall bladder polyps. The age of the patients ranged from 27 to 79. There were 14 males and 36 females. All of the patients had a detailed preoperative workup including complete liver function test and sonographic examination of the hepatobiliary system. Additional pre-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies were done in 3 and operative cholangiograms were done in another 3 to confirm the absence of common bile duct stones or to delineate anatomy. Although we encountered a few problems during the operations, such as severe adhesion, bleeding, difficult dissection, CO2 leakage, difficult insufflation, or large stones, all of the 50 patients completed the LC successfully without conversion to open cholecystectomy. The average operation time was 60 minutes, ranging from 30 to 135 minutes. Drain tubes were used in 7 cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

From June 1989 to October 1990, laparoscopic fenestration was performed for four symptomatic solitary cyst and one polycystic liver disease patients, without any morbidity. Mean hospital stay was short: 6.8 days (range of 3-14 days). No recurrence was observed on ultrasound controls with a mean follow-up of 6.4 months (range of 2-15 months).

This high-risk patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystostomy and gallstone removal as treatment for symptomatic gallstone disease. On cholecystography the patient was found to have a small stone fragment in the cystic duct. Under intravenous sedation this stone fragment was fragmented and removed using an 8.5F flexible ureteroscope and a coumarin pulsed-dye laser lithotriptor. The stone was fragmented and washed into the common bile duct. Follow-up cholecystogram prior to removal of the cholecystostomy tube demonstrated no stones in the gallbladder, cystic duct, or common bile duct. The management of percutaneous removal of retained stones is reviewed."
CD009323,0,1834271,0,Laparoscopic ligation of a leaking cystic duct.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has rapidly become an acceptable surgical technique. Indeed it may become the preferred method for cholecystectomy, with the open method reserved for complicated cases. Early series of LC have shown a mortality rate of 0-1%, comparing favorably to the open method. However, complications such as bile duct injury, cystic duct leaks, and biliary collections may be more frequent. We report the first case of cystic duct leakage after LC successfully managed by subsequent laparoscopic ligation."
CD009323,0,1834270,0,Laparoscopic cannulation of an accessory hepatic duct: a case report.,"Anomalies of the cystic duct are commonly encountered by the operating surgeon. Accessory hepatic ducts directly entering the gallbladder are among the most difficult of these to identify. Because of magnification, laparoscopy provides oftentimes superior visualization of the biliary tree. Herein, we describe a case in which an accessory hepatic duct was identified, cannulated, and evaluated with cholangiography enabling appropriate operative treatment."
CD009323,0,1834269,0,Cholecystcholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: cholecystcholangiography or cystic duct cholangiography.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is being used more frequently in the treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis. The procedure as originally described was performed with cystic duct cholangiography. An alternate technique of performing cholangiography is cholecystcholangiography. Because of the objections that have been voiced concerning direct gallbladder injections namely, reliability of the technique, quality of the studies, and the risk of forcing stones into the common bile duct this study was performed. Subjects were 25 consecutive patients who underwent cholecystcholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A standard technique was developed and used. Studies were graded from 0 to 5 depending upon quality with 5 being the best and 0 the worst. A 5 consisted of visualization of all of the biliary tract structures and the duodenum and a 0 consisted of visualization of only the gallbladder. Acceptable studies (graded 3, 4, or 5) were obtained in 20 patients (80%). An inability to obtain an acceptable study could usually be determined prior to contrast injection. Accordingly there would be no time delay in proceeding directly to cystic duct cholangiography. In our patients, 48% had stones in the gallbladder smaller than the caliber of the cystic duct. Based upon the results of this study we believe that cholecystcholangiography is the technique of choice for intraoperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In patients in whom this technique is not feasible the surgeon should proceed directly to cystic duct cholangiography. There was no added risk to the patient when cholecystcholangiography was performed. There was a benefit in terms of the ease of the procedure and the performance of the procedure over cystic duct cholangiography. The determination of ductal anatomy prior to cystic duct dissection may be important in minimizing the risk of ductal injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,1830737,0,The role of cholangiography in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Cholangiography is not routinely performed in open surgery, but there are reasons why it should be in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. These include finding common duct stones, identifying the cystic-common duct junction, and noting an inadvertent injury. Thirty-six (7.0%) of 516 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were converted to open surgery; 24 before attempting cholangiography and 12 based on roentgenographic findings. In 73 patients (14.1%), cholangiography showed abnormal findings. Common duct injury was identified in one patient and common duct stones were found in 35. Twenty-one patients were treated laparoscopically and eight underwent open choledocholithotomy. In 22 patients, a short cystic duct was seen that might otherwise have been overlooked, and possible injury was avoided. Cholangiography should be attempted routinely, so that in cases with abnormal findings, open cholecystectomy may be considered."
CD009323,0,1655553,0,Giant metastatic VIPoma in the liver.,"A case of giant metastatic liver VIPoma manifesting WDHA syndrome is described. The patient was a 33-year-old Japanese male who was admitted because of persisting watery diarrhea and weight loss. Laboratory examinations revealed marked hypokalemia, mild hypercalcemia and highly elevated plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and glucagon levels. Intensive imaging examinations disclosed two large tumors in the liver but not in other organs, including the pancreas. Laparoscopy disclosed a slightly elevated purplish-colored large tumor on the surface of the apparently normal liver. At operation, however, a small hard nodule was observed in the tail of the pancreas. Histologically, it was revealed to be a VIPoma resembling a carcinoid or an islet cell tumor, and was identical to the liver tumors. Thus, this neoplasm was considered to be a VIPoma of pancreatic origin, with metastatic lesions in the liver."
CD009323,0,1829588,0,Avoidance of bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Common bile duct (CBD) injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to have a higher incidence than during open cholecystectomy. This may be a function of inadequate instruction, inadequate caution, or inexperience, or may represent an inherent flaw in laparoscopic exposure. The aim of this study was to identify several steps in laparoscopic exposure of the gallbladder, cystic duct, and Calot's triangle to minimize the risk of surgical disorientation and CBD injury. A review of the first 180 laparoscopic cholecystectomies from the author's series was performed. Maneuvers that provided optimal exposure of the critical anatomy were culled from the video record. These maneuvers were (1) routine use of a 30 degree forward oblique viewing telescope, (2) firm cephalic traction on the fundus of the gallbladder to reduce redundancy in the infundibulum of the gallbladder and best expose the cystic duct, (3) lateral traction on the infundibulum of the gallbladder to place the cystic duct perpendicular to the CBD, (4) dissection of the cystic duct at the infundibulum of the gallbladder, and (5) routine fluoroscopic cholangiography. If these steps do not provide the surgeon with comfortable anatomic orientation, the procedure should be converted to open cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,1751827,0,Mirizzi's syndrome: a contraindication to coelioscopic cholecystectomy.,"An impacted gallstone in the cystic duct with subsequent inflammation and edema resulting in extrinsic compression of the common bile or common hepatic duct with obstructive jaundice is known as Mirizzi's syndrome. An uncommon complication of cholelithiasis, Mirizzi's syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of any patient who has extrahepatic biliary obstruction. We present a case of a patient who underwent open rather than coelioscopic cholecystectomy based upon the preoperative diagnosis of Mirizzi's syndrome. A multidisciplinary approach to such patients facilitates the decision between open and endoscopic cholecystectomy. Mirizzi's syndrome may represent a contraindication to endoscopic cholecystectomy."

Initially, common duct stones presented a barrier to this treatment modality and are said to be unsuspected in 5-9 per cent of patients. A technique is described that removes common bile duct stones through the cystic duct with a flexible nephroureteroscope, thereby extending the range of laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
CD009323,0,1826993,0,Cystic duct cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"At present, there is no consensus regarding the routine use of intraoperative cholangiography during cholecystectomy. We describe a reliable technique for performing cystic duct cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Using this technique, we were able to cannulate the cystic duct in 97% of patients, completely visualize the biliary tree and duodenum in 93% of patients, and identify unsuspected choledocholithiasis in 3% of patients. Treatment options for the management of choledocholithiasis demonstrated by cholangiograms during laparoscopic cholecystectomy include conversion to an open cholecystectomy and common duct exploration, or endoscopic sphincterotomy and common duct stone extraction following laparoscopic cholecystectomy."

Twenty-three patients were selected for surgical resection because the tumour was smaller than 5 cm, not centrally located and at least 1 cm away from main structures; there was no evidence of multicentricity or metastatic disease; and the Child-Pugh classification was A or B and the urea-nitrogen synthesis rate at least 6 g/day. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was used routinely to identify oesophageal varices which were present in 17 cases; ten patients with a history of variceal haemorrhage (43 per cent) had preoperative endoscopic sclerotherapy. In cases with recurrent haemorrhage, surgery was used to prevent intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. Tumour resection was carried out using controlled hypotension and hepatoduodenal ligament clamping. Twelve bisegmentectomies, ten segmentectomies and one atypical resection were performed. The operative mortality rate was 13 per cent with liver failure and sepsis as the causes of death. The 'recurrence rate' was 26 per cent and the late mortality rate for the whole group up to 1 January 1990 was 30 per cent; 13 patients were still alive. The 12-month survival rate was 77 per cent and after 5 years it was 49 per cent. Thus, surgical resection of small liver tumours is the treatment of choice in this selected group of patients."
CD009323,0,1825762,0,The Los Angeles experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Surgeons should be competent in diagnostic laparoscopy before performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Well-structured and endorsed courses with experienced faculty are important. Within 12 months, 418 LCs were performed in our hospital. The number of open cholecystectomies decreased to one third of all cholecystectomies performed. Cholangiography was attempted routinely and the duct was successfully cannulated in 90%. Inquiries were made at 6 other hospitals within a 5-mile radius where a total of 220 LCs were performed. The following gray areas need to be addressed: patients with slightly increased liver function tests but no jaundice, and unsuspected stones discovered by cholangiography. New projects are in progress to explore the common bile duct via the cystic duct or directly through the common bile duct with insertion of a T tube. The authors recommend proper training as well as caution and sound judgment before commencing with LC."
CD009323,0,1825757,0,Routine or selected intraoperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy?,"Intraoperative cholangiography can be helpful in cases in which the anatomy is obscured, unsuspected stones are discovered, or anatomic anomalies of surgical importance are found. There is a difference between open and closed laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It is more difficult to locate the common bile duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. During this procedure, the anatomy is distorted due to the extreme traction at the infundibulum. With a short cystic duct, the common bile duct can become ""tented"" and simulate the appearance of the cystic duct. Ductal injuries may be avoided by knowing where the clips should be placed in relation to the ductal system and by obtaining information about the intact display of the distal and proximal ductal system. The image can be observed immediately by using a modern fluoroscopic system, and permanent documentation can be obtained. We attempted intraoperative cholangiography in 415 cases and were successful in 90%. We strongly recommend the routine use of intraoperative cholangiography."
CD009323,0,1669370,0,Safety and efficacy of laparoscopic cholecystectomy using monopolar electrocautery in the porcine model.,"Recent reports suggest that laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy may become the preferred therapy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. To assess the efficacy and safety of this technique, using monopolar electrocautery instead of laser for the gallbladder dissection, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed on 11 pigs. Under general anesthesia, a pneumoperitoneum was established, and four sheaths were placed into the abdomen for introduction of instruments. Using video laparoscopic guidance, the cystic duct and artery were isolated, clipped, and divided. Monopolar electrocautery was used to dissect the gallbladder from its fossa. Five animals were sacrificed immediately, without visible evidence of injury to the bile ducts, liver, or intestine. The remaining six pigs were allowed to recover. One animal died 10 days postoperatively due to adhesive small bowel obstruction. The remainder survived in good health until sacrifice at 1 month. Histologic examination of the gallbladder bed and liver revealed no evidence of ongoing local hepatocyte destruction or chronic cholestasis. Cholangiography demonstrated the bile ducts to be intact. Mean (+/- SEM) total serum bilirubin (TB), alkaline phosphatase (AP), and glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) at the time of sacrifice were similar to nonoperated swine (n = 10): TB, 0.12 +/- 0.02 versus 0.11 +/- 0.01 mg/dl; AP, 175 +/- 23 versus 162 +/- 10 IU/L; SGOT, 37 +/- 4 versus 55 +/- 7 IU/L, respectively (p > 0.05). We conclude that laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed using monopolar electrocautery without significant acute injury to the liver, bile ducts, or surrounding viscera. Furthermore, the porcine model can be utilized by surgeons to attain competence in this technique prior to instituting clinical application in humans."
CD009323,0,1831522,0,[Possibilities of laparoscopic decompression of the gallbladder in middle-aged and elderly patients with diseases of the biliary tract].,"It is established that laparoscopic cholecystostomy presents the most acceptable method of gall bladder decompression in acute cholecystitis patients of advanced age comprising a high-risk group for surgery. Cholecystostomy efficiency reaches 97.2%. In case the procedure is not feasible in acute cholecystitis patients with intrahepatic position of the gall bladder or perivesicular adhesions the preference should be given to transhepatic drainage of the gall bladder whose effectiveness is 88.5%. An expedient method of laparoscopic decompression of the biliary tracts in mechanical jaundice due to tumor obstruction of the terminal part of the common bile duct is the formation of an external biliary fistula and ""continuous"" direct drainage of the gall bladder warranting satisfactory results in 93.3 and 100% of cases, respectively. Patients with a 1.5-week history of mechanical jaundice are not recommended transhepatic drainage, in longer duration of the jaundice (more than 1 month) it becomes contraindicated."
CD009323,0,1828286,0,[Endoscopic and sparing surgical interventions in the treatment of patients with acute cholecystitis and high surgical risk].,"Laparoscopic gallbladder drainage was performed as an alternative intervention to an emergency operation in 97 patients with acute cholecystitis whose ages ranged from 60 to 89 years. One patient died from thromboembolism of the pulmonary artery. After acute inflammation was arrested, 37 patients underwent cholecystectomy. The risk of a radical operation was ascertained to be very high in 58 cases. In 19 of these cases endoscopic cleansing of the cystic cavity was performed through cholecystostomy formed during laparoscopic drainage of the gallbladder. In 39 cases the therapeutic process was completed by a sparing operation--sanative cholecystostomy which was carried out under local anesthesia. There were no fatal outcomes in these groups. Endoscopic papillosphincterotomy was conducted in 17 patients, with stones in the gallbladder and choledocholithiasis, after which the stones were removed. The performance of endoscopic and surgical interventions which cause minimal injury provides for adequate sanative treatment of the gallbladder in cases in which cholecystectomy is an extremely high risk."

The procedure was successful in 150 patients, while in ten patients the procedure was converted to conventional cholecystectomy for the following reasons: suspected malignancy (2), cystic duct stone (1), dysfunction of equipment (2), adhesions (1), concomitant liver tumor (1), abscess in the hepatoduodenal ligament following endoscopic papillotomy (1), and chronic cholecystitis (2). Four patients developed substantial complications. Two patients developed biliary leakage requiring laparotomy and endoscopy placement of a nasobiliary tube in one case each. The other two patients developed intraabdominal bleeding that forced an emergency laparotomy in one case. With increasing experience in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, we would only consider a preoperative suspicion of malignancy as an absolute contraindication."
CD009323,0,1837814,0,[Technique of laparoscopic cholecystectomy].,"A new technique for laparoscopic cholecystectomy is described which regards as far as possible the conventional approach to cholecystectomy. Positioning of the operating team is identical to normal cholecystectomy, and the surgeon is able to use both hands to operate since the camera is handled by the assistant. Dissection of the infundibulum is performed in the socalled ""tease-and-tear"" technique. The peritoneal layer is opened by coagulation. The cystic duct and artery are bluntly dissected by a commercially available dissector. Fat and connective tissue are gently torn off from both structures. After closure of cystic duct and artery by clips, the gallbladder is cut out by thermocoagulation. 178 operations were performed by 8 surgeons; mean duration of the operation was 60 min. A change to open cholecystectomy was necessary in 2.5%. Three complications occurred, requiring reoperation in one case of insufficiency of the cystic duct and another one with intestinal perforation. In the third case, bile leakage from an aberrant bile-duct occurred but dried up spontaneously after a few days. No death occurred nor were there any lesions of the common bile-duct. Conclusively, this new technique seems to be safe and simple to teach due to its approximity to the conventional technique and is recommended as a standard procedure."

Catheterization of the cystic duct was successfully performed in 89 of 99 attempts. The cholangiogram altered the course of the procedure in 9 (10%) of these cases. In three subjects, the information obtained revealed unsuspected choledocholithiasis. In the remaining six patients, unusual and potentially hazardous anatomic relationships were discovered that were not visible via laparoscopic exposure alone. Arguments for the selective use of cholangiography during open cholecystectomy are based only on the identification of unsuspected stones. The strongest argument for routine cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the additional anatomic information obtained. Based on our experience, we advocate that routine cholangiography be a part of all laparoscopic cholecystectomies."

This instrument facilitates intraoperative cholangiography. A plastic trocar stylet eliminates the metal shadow of the trocar during cholangiography. A new ""laparocamera"" is described where camera and telescope are built together in one unit decreasing the need for additional manipulation during the procedure. A camera holder driven by air helps the operator to keep his/her hands free. The need for a third assistant is avoided by inserting the camera into a (presterilized) holder, the position of which is controlled by press buttons."

Fifty-two patients had successful completion of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy (87%). The reasons for conversion to open cholecystectomy were acute cholecystitis (four patients), inability to define the cystic duct-common duct junction (three patients), and one patient with an unexpected choledochal cyst variant. Forty patients (77%) were discharged on the first post-operative day, and the remaining 12 patients on the second post-operative day. Thirty-three patients (63%) required only oral pain medication, and 11 patients (21%) needed no pain medication post-operatively. Fifty-one patients (98%) had resumed normal activities by the seventh post-operative day. Cholecystectomy remains the treatment of choice for biliary colic. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy minimizes length of stay in the hospital, lessens post-operative pain, allows quicker return to normal activities, and has a superior cosmetic result."
CD009323,0,1824811,0,Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy.,"Cholecystectomy remains the most effective form of therapy for patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis. An alternative method of gallbladder removal, laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy, was attempted in 100 patients. Five patients required conversion of the laparoscopic procedure to an open laparotomy for the following reasons: discovery of a pancreatic malignancy in one patient, extensive adhesions in one, presence of an aberrant accessory right hepatic duct in one, common hepatic duct injury in one, and avulsion of the cystic duct in one. Both ductal injuries occurred during the early phase of the clinical program. In those patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 93 were discharged within 24 hours of surgery and 94 returned to normal activity within 1 week. Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy appears to offer a number of advantages in patient care as well as a significant reduction in health care expenses for gallbladder disease. Appropriate training in laparoscopic surgery is necessary in order to avoid operative complications."
CD009323,0,1824810,0,Implications of peritoneal cytology for staging of early pancreatic cancer.,"Cytologic examination of peritoneal washings was performed in 40 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (35 head, 5 body) whose tumors had been selected as potentially resectable by computed tomographic (CT) findings. Saline (100 mL) was instilled and aspirated at laparoscopy in 27 patients and at laparotomy in 13. Malignant cells were found in the peritoneal washings in 12 of 40 patients (30%): 29% in cancers of the pancreatic head versus 40% in the body; 33% at laparoscopy versus 23% at laparotomy; and in 4 of 8 patients with ascites versus 8 of 32 without ascites. The cytology was positive in 6 of 8 patients (75%) who had a prior percutaneous needle biopsy versus 6 of 32 (19%) of those who did not (p less than 0.01). Liver metastases were found in six patients, all with negative cytology. One of 10 pancreatic head cancers with positive cytology was resectable versus 13 of 25 with negative cytology (p less than 0.05). Survival was significantly longer in patients with negative cytology. We conclude that (1) pancreatic cancer sheds malignant cells into the peritoneum early and commonly; (2) laparoscopic lavage is an effective means of cytologic study; (3) ascites is not a precondition for cytologic study, nor does its presence necessarily imply carcinomatosis; (4) intraperitoneal spread of cancer cells may be promoted by tumor biopsy; (5) cytologic findings provide an additional index of resectability; and (6) cytologic findings appear to correlate with duration of survival. This study shows that even ""localized"" pancreatic cancer is often not contained and suggests caution with biopsy of potentially curable lesions."

Resectability was proved in 16 (29%) of 55 patients for the head of the pancreas, 1 (6%) of 17 for the body and tail of the pancreas, and 14 (88%) of 16 for the ampulla. The combined findings of computed tomography and angiography showed that more than 87% of pancreatic head tumors were unresectable because of vascular encasement, but neither modality sufficed alone. Small liver and peritoneal metastases were found in 15 (27%) of 55 cancers of the head of the pancreas, 11 (65%) of 17 cancers of the body and tail of the pancreas, and 1 (6%) of 16 cancers of the ampulla; computed tomography missed all but 2 of these instances of metastasis, but laparoscopy with biopsy identified 22 (96%) of 23 instances. Magnetic resonance imaging findings did not differ significantly from computed tomography and conferred no added benefit. Ninety percent of unresectable tumors were identified. Seventy-eight percent of pancreatic head cancers were resectable when all test results were negative vs 5% (2/37) when any test result was positive.

CD009323,0,2151853,0,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: instrumentation and technique.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is rapidly evolving as a therapeutic modality for the treatment of gallstone disease. The technical details of this procedure and the method by which the gallbladder is dissected and removed are critical to the safe, effective execution of the procedure. Our technique has been developed through extensive practice in porcine models and through experience with more than 250 patients. To perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy we employ a high-resolution video endoscopy system, two high-resolution color monitors, a high-flow CO2 insufflator, a 300 W Xenon light source, electrocautery and/or lasers, and an endoscopic suction-irrigation system. This equipment permits the surgeon to obtain a clear field of view within the abdomen. With these tools, appropriately designed for laparoscopic surgery, including a laparoscope, graspers, dissectors, cholangiography equipment, scissors, and clip appliers, the surgeon can remove the gallbladder without opening the abdomen. The procedure requires the induction of a CO2 pneumoperitoneum, insertion of four trocars, and placement of a grasping retractor to set the operative field. An additional retractor placed on Hartmann's pouch provides countertraction for dissection of the hilum. Careful dissection around the cystic duct and cystic artery with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection allows the surgeon to skeletonize the cystic duct and artery. After intraoperative cholangiography confirms the anatomy, the cystic artery and cystic duct are clipped and divided. Electrocautery or laser techniques can be used to perform retrograde dissection of the gallbladder from the liver bed and insure hemostasis. The gallbladder is detached and removed intact through the large trocars. This basic technique can be applied in a wide variety of patients with cholelithiasis. The surgeon proficient in this technique may apply it to a broad range of patients with gallbladder disease."

In 3 cases the laparoscopic procedure was abandoned, twice because of a sever bleeding, one for too compact surrounding adhesions. The mean follow up is 9 months. 123 were drained 1 day 16 had no drain. The mortality is zero. 2 patients without drainage developed a sub hepatic and douglas pouch abscess. They were cured by a lavage drainage laparoscopically made. 1 patient with drainages had a 7 days bile leak, which disappeared spontaneously. The 136 others have had a short stay in the hospital (2-4 days) a painless post operative time. They could go back to work and sport within 1 week. They have minimal scars and no danger of incisional herriae. The magnification of the optical system enables the dissection of the cystic duct and artery easier and safer than it is by mini laparotomy mostly in obese people. At the beginning of our experience only the patients with frequent biliary colics have been selected for the laparoscopic procedure. At that time 13 patients with subacute cholecystitis and 9 patients with stones in the commun bile duct have had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy associated with an endoscopic sphincterotomy in the last cases without complications."

Because of evidence supporting the effectiveness of both single agent platinum (P) and the combination of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (CA), patients were treated with alternating cycles of CA and CP. Primary surgery to remove the bulk of tumor to less than 2 cm was possible in 45% of the 85 eligible patients, and an additional 17% had similar surgery after two to four cycles of chemotherapy. Fifteen percent of patients progressed on chemotherapy. Of the 68 who were clinically and radiologically without disease at the completion of chemotherapy, 91% had second-look surgery. Forty-eight percent of these women had residual disease. All patients but one are at risk for greater than 60 months, with a median follow-up of 86 months. Overall 5-year survival is 26%, with a median survival of 33 months. Twenty patients survived over 5 years with 11 continuing to be free of disease (13% of all eligible patients).

The group comprised 7830 women (57.27%) and 5842 men (42.73%). Cystic changes were detected in 39 patients (0.28%). During subsequent examinations they revealed that in four patients metastases of tumours were involved. The correctness of the ultrasonographic diagnosis was confirmed in 35 patients (89.7%). Non-inflammatory and non-parasitic cysts were present in 31 patients (0.23%), incl. 20 women (0.26%) and 11 men (0.19%) with a sex ratio of 1.4:1. Concurrent cystic changes on the kidneys were found in 22.6% and on the pancreas in 12.9%. The spleen was not affected by cystic changes in any of the patients. The diagnosis of cysts was supplemented by laboratory, laparoscopic, scintigraphic, computed tomographic peroperative and aimed bioptic examinations, depending on the character of changes.

CD009323,0,2530642,0,Percutaneous stone clearance of the gallbladder through an access cholecystostomy. Laparoscopic-guided technique.,"A laparoscopic-guided technique of percutaneous gallstone fragmentation/removal has been developed in the pig. The procedure entails the creation of a percutaneous access cholecystostomy. The access tract can be safely dilated after 7 days to F16, thereby allowing the introduction of both the Olympus flexible and the Berci-Shore rigid choledochoscopes. Following endoscopic occlusion of the cystic duct by a biliary balloon catheter, stone fragmentation can be conducted under direct visual control. In this particular study, electrohydraulic lithotripsy was performed of human cholesterol and bile-pigment stones inserted into the gallbladder of 16 pigs. The gallstone debris resulting from lithotripsy was then washed out with saline. Larger residual fragments could easily be extracted with the Dormia basket under visual guidance. There was a significant positive correlation between stone size (r = 0.98) and weight (r = 0.96) and the number of pulses needed to achieve satisfactory stone fragmentation. The gross composition of the stones (predominantly cholesterol or pigment) did not influence the number of pulses required. Electrohydraulic lithotripsy caused an explosion effect (the fragments hit the gallbladder wall), causing submucosal haematoma formation. This, however, was not followed by any untoward effect until sacrifice of the animals 10-16 weeks later. Electrohydraulic shocks delivered to the gallbladder wall itself resulted in larger haematoma formation and breach of the gallbladder mucosa with active bleeding into the gallbladder lumen, but again no instance of gallbladder perforation was encountered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009323,0,2970682,0,Value of diagnostic laparoscopy in young women with possible appendicitis.,"Removal of a normal appendix because of suspected appendicitis occurs most frequently in women of reproductive age. We investigated the value of laparoscopy in the diagnostic evaluation for possible appendicitis in women of childbearing age. Fifty-one women were entered in a management protocol, which included diagnostic laparoscopy in instances with atypical features. Twenty patients underwent immediate appendectomy because of history and physical findings classical for appendicitis; 31 women with atypical history and physical findings underwent an initial diagnostic laparoscopy. In the group of patients who underwent immediate appendectomy because of classical presentation, five of the appendices removed were normal. At laparoscopy, appendicitis was diagnosed in five patients, another disease in 15 and no diagnostic abnormality was found in six. Five patients had a normal appendix removed, two because of questionable inflammation and three because of nonvisualization of the appendix. There were no false-negative examination results. Twenty-one patients required no further operative intervention after laparoscopy. The negative appendectomy rate remained unchanged (ten negative appendectomies of 30 performed). Definitive diagnoses of eight instances of pelvic inflammatory disease, six of ruptured ovarian cysts and one instance of ileitis of the small intestine were made earlier than would have been possible without diagnostic laparoscopy in this setting. Diagnostic laparoscopy permits earlier definitive diagnosis and prompt institution of appropriate therapy for disease of the female reproductive tract that simulates appendicitis. Caution is advised, however, when diagnostic laparoscopy is applied more frequently than right lower quadrant exploration in the management of probable appendicitis. The improvement in diagnostic accuracy may be offset by an increased number of negative appendectomies resulting from nonvisualization and false-positive inflammation."
CD009323,0,2471182,0,Carcinoma of the gall bladder--can we do anything?,"A retrospective review of 143 cases of carcinoma of the gall bladder is presented. The disease was more common in females in the 5th and 6th decades. Pain, anorexia, weight loss and jaundice were the common presenting symptoms, and hepatomegaly and palpable gall bladder the common signs. Laboratory and radiological investigations were merely confirmatory as the diagnosis in a majority of the cases was clinically obvious. Aspiration cytology and laparoscopic biopsy were of help in obtaining histological diagnosis. Only 47 patients were considered fit enough to undergo laparotomy. In a majority of these patients biopsy alone was possible while palliative procedures were performed in the others. The operative mortality was 18% even in this selected group of patients, due to the poor general condition and the advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Curative resection may be possible and long term survival is expected in incidentally found carcinoma at cholecystectomy. The only hope lies in prevention by prompt treatment of patients with benign biliary disease."
CD009323,0,2964382,1,Laparoscopy for pancreatic cancer: does it benefit the patient?,"The findings in 73 patients undergoing laparoscopy for pancreatic cancer have been reviewed. The procedure was performed immediately prior to a proposed laparotomy which was undertaken in 51 patients. In this subgroup, 42 patients were correctly staged as having incurable/inoperable disease by laparoscopy but only four out of nine patients judged to be resectable were found to be operable at laparotomy. Laparoscopic target biopsy/fine needle cytology of the primary or its secondary deposits confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in 61 out of 65 patients (92%). Whereas the majority of hepatic deposits visualized by laparoscopy had been detected by the prelaparoscopic imaging tests, peritoneal and omental deposits were only identified by laparoscopy. Laparoscopy is a useful procedure in the staging of patients with pancreatic cancer and establishes the diagnosis of advanced disease thereby, obviating a laparotomy in all those patients in whom surgical palliation is not indicated. The procedure should be performed in those patients in whom a laparotomy is contemplated."

A low-density mass was observed with the computed tomographic scanning. A tomographic guided needle biopsy was informed as normal liver cells. Angiography showed tortuous hepatic arteries. Laparoscopy revealed a solid formation blood was obtained when it was punctured. Laparotomy was indicated. A tumor in the right hepatic lobe was found but a surgeon did not resect the lesion because a congelation biopsy failed to demonstrate tumoral cells. The diagnosis of hepatic adenoma was reached with the definitive biopsy.

Clinical pearls and perils revisited.,"I recount some clinical ""pearls and perils"" to help reassess the contributions of abdominal ultrasound, cholangiography, needle biopsy of the liver, and laparoscopy. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrates stones in the gallbladder in approximately 98% of cases, but in only 15% in the common bile duct, whereas computerized tomography scan reveals them in greater than or equal to 50%. On cholangiography a blood clot (in hemobilia) may closely resemble a common duct stone, as may spasm or tumor of the distal duct. Iatrogenic stricture at the junction of the left and right hepatic ducts may be indistinguishable from a Klatskin tumor. Differentiation of extrahepatic from intrahepatic cholestasis is frequently impossible in needle specimens of the liver. Needle biopsy provides the best means of establishing a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis. Laparoscopy is particularly valuable in the diagnosis of cirrhosis missed in blind biopsy specimens."

Injury involved the small intestines in 75% and the large intestines in 25% of the cases. Sixty-nine percent of all lacerations were minor, and 31% were major. Seventy-two percent of the lacerations occurred during uncomplicated gynecologic operations. All lacerations were repaired with one or more of four basic procedures: one- or two-layer closure of intestinal lacerations, partial bowel resection, intestinal reanastomosis, and colostomy. It is suggested that gynecologists acquire basic knowledge in the prevention of intestinal injury and the principles of repair of intestinal lacerations.

Of the 470 cytologic malignancies, only one was a false-positive. The most frequently diagnosed malignant neoplasms were carcinomas of the colon, breast, pancreas, lung, and liver. The overall accuracy rate of cytologic examination was 96%, with a sensitivity of 94%, and a specificity of 100%. Predictive values for both positive and negative results, were high: 100% and 95%, respectively. Reviewing the literature on aspiration cytology of the liver, we found that our results confirmed the findings of others: that cytologic examination of liver aspirates and brushings is a safe, useful, and accurate technique and may obviate tissue biopsy in cases of tumors metastatic to the liver."

CD009323,0,2936262,1,Laparoscopy in the staging and planning of therapy for pancreatic cancer.,"Although staging of pancreatic cancer is critical to the planning of therapy, many patients come to laparotomy with liver or peritoneal metastases not suspected or detected during conventional preoperative testing. We performed laparoscopic examinations as part of the staging evaluation of 40 patients with proved pancreatic cancer who were candidates for curative resection or intraoperative radiotherapy. In each patient, laparoscopy was the last test before laparotomy and was carried out only if all other test results were negative for metastases. In 14 of 40 patients, single, small (1 to 2 mm) metastatic nodules were detected and verified by biopsy in the liver (6 patients), on the parietal peritoneum (7 patients), and in the omentum (1 patient). It is likely that several of these lesions would have been overlooked at routine exploration. Because of the positive findings, therapy was altered in all 14 patients. None received intraoperative radiotherapy, nine who did not have jaundice were discharged without operation, three had biliary or gastric bypass only, and two were treated by percutaneous biliary stenting. Of the 26 patients who had negative findings on laparoscopic examination, the absence of gross metastasis was confirmed at laparotomy in 23. Three false-negative findings were caused by incomplete examination of the liver in two patients and a central liver lesion in one patient. Therefore, 43 percent of all patients (17 of 40) had demonstrable but unsuspected nonlocal metastases, and laparoscopic examination detected 82 percent (14 of 17) of these. The overall accuracy of laparoscopy was 93 percent and that of examination with negative findings, 88 percent. In eliminating useless laparotomy and redirecting treatment plans, laparoscopy contributes significantly both to the proper management of patients with pancreatic cancer and to increased efficiency of resource utilization."

These combinations were high-dose methotrexate-leucovorin plus cyclophosphamide (MECY) or cyclophosphamide, hexamethylmelamine, doxorubicin, and DDP (CHAD). Patients with no clinically measurable disease after 6 months of therapy were evaluated by laparoscopy. In the absence of disease progression at the time of the laparoscopy the study design called for a repeat cycle of four weekly DDP courses and another five monthly courses of the assigned multidrug combination. All patients with no evidence of disease after 1 year of treatment had a second-look laparoscopy which, if negative, was followed by a second-look laparotomy. This report includes all of the consecutively entered patients observed for a minimum of 1 year or to death. DDP-MECY and DDP-CHAD were similarly active for overall response rates and complete response rates according to laparoscopic criteria. However, DDP-MECY had a statistically significantly lower relapse rate (P less than 0.02) and a statistically significantly higher negative second-look laparotomy rate than did DDP-CHAD. Using all entered patients, with no exclusions from analysis, eight of 17 patients (47%) treated with DDP-MECY had negative second-looks after 1 year of treatment. This compares with one of 16 (6%) negative second-looks in patients treated with DDP-CHAD (P less than 0.02). The high negative second-look rate with DDP-MECY is exciting. Positive cytologic washings at the 6-month laparoscopic evaluation were highly predictive that residual disease would be found at the 1-year second-look surgery.

CD009323,0,6650665,0,Modification of pancreatic carcinogenesis in the hamster model. 6. The effect of ductal ligation and excision.,"The effect of ligation and excision of the pancreatic duct in pancreatic carcinogenesis was examined in the hamster model. Animals were treated with a single dose (20 mg/kg body weight) of N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine (BOP) either immediately (Group 1) or on Days 1 (Group 2), 3 (Group 3) or 7 (Group 4) after ligation and excision of the duct of the splenic lobe. Group 5 received BOP shortly after laparoscopy, and Group 6 consisted of BOP-treated controls. All hamsters were killed 46 weeks after BOP treatment. The results showed that despite advanced atrophy of the splenic lobe distal to the excised duct in Groups 1-4, some hamsters in Groups 2, 3, and 4 showed hyperplasia, dysplasia, and increased mitotic activities of ductal and ductular cells. However, carcinomas in the duct-excised atrophic lobe were found only in Groups 1-3. These data indicate that BOP carcinogenesis is mediated through blood circulation, and that cancer development is not inhibited in the duct-excised lobe for up to 3 days after surgery. However, in the entire pancreas, a significant reduction in tumor incidence was seen when the carcinogen was given immediately, or to a lesser extent, 1 day after surgery, regardless of whether or not excision was made. On the contrary, BOP, when given 3 and 7 days after duct excision, enhanced tumor development in the nonexcised (intact) pancreas, compared with other test groups and with BOP controls. Both inhibition and enhancement seemed due to a proportional decrease and increase, respectively, of BOP-responsive cells throughout the intact pancreas."

CD009323,0,6838748,0,Effect of anaesthesia and surgery on the pre-S-phase cell cycle kinetics of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes of previously healthy people.,"The influence of general anaesthesia, and of operative surgery, on immune responsiveness was studied in blood obtained from 26 women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization (minor operation group) and in 14 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy (major operation group). Since immunity depends ultimately on clonal expansion of lymphocytes, the growth potential of peripheral blood lymphocytes was studied in tissue culture by mitogen stimulation. There was no evidence of any change in either the number of responding cells (those that have left the resting G0-phase and responded to mitogen stimulation by entering the G1-phase of the first cycle of growth) or in the rate at which cells grow in volume during the period of study. It was concluded that there was no evidence that anaesthesia, or surgery, impaired this aspect of the immune response in our patients, but the design of the experiments does not allow comment on other aspects of the immune response such as antigen presentation, immunoregulation and effector mechanisms, which are superimposed on the basic clonal expansion mechanisms studied in this investigation. Incidentally, we noted that the standard method for isolation of lymphocytes from peripheral blood frequently yielded highly contaminated preparations: if this fallacy was not appreciated, tests with contaminated lymphocytes could be misinterpreted as showing depression."

The most frequent symptoms of PBC are itching, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly; from the laboratory tests--most characteristic is the increase of serum 5'-nucleotidase, AP, LAP, gamma GTP, GOT, cholesterol, cholic acid and antimitochondrial antibodies and IgM (AP, 5'-nucleotidase and antimitochondrial antibodies, being most significant in making the early diagnosis). The laboratory results in PBC are compared with those of the chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, extrahepatic cholestasis, with outlining the characteristic differences, depending on the diagnosis. The diagnostic advantages of the various methods are discussed (mainly laparoscopy and liver biopsy) and the histologic and electron microscopic changes of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, via echography--81 per cent, laparoscopy--73 per cent, scintigraphy--61.53 per cent and liver biopsy--50 per cent. The results from the treatment with cholestrimine, corticosteroids and azathioprine and surgical treatment, observing a temporary improvement and progressing of PBC, are reported. With the follow-up care of 20 patients, it was established, that 9 had died 5 years, on the average, after making the diagnosis, 11 survived after the 5 years and they are still followed up. The longest survival was reported in two females--11 and 15 years after the onset of PBC."

By the effected changeover from compound scanning to the high-resolution real-time B-process, it has become possible to recognize at an early date even small locoregional recurring tumours (1.5 cm diameter), metastases of lymph nodes (1-1.5 cm diameter) and hepatic filiae (1.0 cm diameter); it has also been possible to detect typical changes, such as stenoses or thromboses, at the major vessels of the upper abdomen, well in time. If the findings are not clear, CT examination will be mandatory, if necessary in conjunction with bolus injection of a contrast medium. These methods have been able to largely replace the well-known invasive procedures, such as ERCP, angiography and laparoscopy in follow-up controls."

During a follow-up of 1 1/2 to 6 years (median, 3 years and 1 month), the survival rate without evidence of recurrent ovarian carcinoma was 95%. Moreover, there was a total absence of complications with the use of the sequential steps of pretherapy peritoneoscopy, a normal preinjection peritoneogram, injection of chromic phosphate in large volumes of solution, frequent change of position of the patient after injection, and abdominal scans after injection. This method appears to be safe and is associated with a significantly high survival rate."

Although there have been many reports dealing with intraabdominal lesions other than those of the liver, there have been few concerning the pancreas. Because of its anatomical characteristics, the laparoscopic approach to the pancreas has been extremely difficult. For endoscopic diagnosis of pancreatic lesions, we have developed a 2-channel operating laparoscope.

Consequently, now endoscopists can diagnose minute (or micro) cancer less than 5 mm in diameter in the digestive organs, particularly in the stomach and the colon. However, early detection of esophageal, biliary tract, or pancreatic cancer is still insufficient in spite of application of a new apparatus or subsidiary method. Among them, regarding recent increment of the cases with pancreatic cancer, it is absolutely necessary for the improvement of a prognosis to reveal small cancer less than 2 cm in diameter, endoscopically. Usefulness of laparoscopy for the diagnosis of hepatocellular cancer is less as compared with hepatic angiography. In this paper, we summarize the present status of gastro-enterological endoscopy in Japan and point clearly the issue to solve in the future."

GSU is the most suitable method to demonstrate the cystous character, but the connection with the biliary tract can be verified by ERCP. Peritoneoscopy is the best procedure in the diagnosis of the polycystic liver; the congenital liver fibrosis can be recognized by biopsy, only.

Considering the relatively advanced disease of pancreatic carcinoma in our six patients the sonographic diagnosis was correct in all of them and with pharmacoangiography we failed on one case. In chronic pancreatitis correct diagnostic results with pharmacoangiography could be obtained in 8 of 18 cases and with sonography in 14 of 18 patients.

Histologic examination of the tumor revealed bland features of bile duct adenoma despite extensive spread within the liver. Over its subsequent course, the tumor progressively replaced the liver, achieving huge size, although there was no evidence of metastases until shortly before the patient's death. This clinical course was very unusual for either bile duct adenoma or cholangiocarcinoma, but would be more characteristic of another tumor of intrahepatic bile duct origin, the biliary cystadenoma. However, this latter diagnosis was excluded with both gross and microscopic pathologic criteria. Evidence is presented to support classification of this tumor as an unusual varient of peripheral cholangiocarcinoma which requires correlation of the clinical and pathologic findings for correst diagnosis."

In cases of urological complications after irradiation therapy, radionephrography, infusion urogram, blood count, cystoscopy, and cystometry should also be carried out after two months. Depending on the clinical picture, radionephrography, blood count and urinalysis are to be repeated in regular intervals. After lymphography with positive findings, x-ray controls are necessary after two and four months. In cases of increasing hydronephrosis and hydroureter due to fibrostenosis of the ureter plastic surgery is recommended. Most urological complications are to be expected after radical operation and postoperative irradiation. In patients with endometrial uterine cancer, metastases mostly occur paraurethrally and in the lungs. Chest x-ray is to be taken every six months. Suspicious paraurethral hardening is cytologically diagnosed by needle biopsy. In ovarian carcinoma stage III and IV repeated x-ray controls of the lungs during longterm polychemotherapy are advisable. Prior to second look operations after combined treatment a second look laparoscopy is particularly important. Urological complications are more frequent after therapy of cervical cancer while ovarian carcinoma is more likely to develop complications of the small bowel."

Study by scanner confirms its cystic nature. This dysembryoplasic nature of this lesion is now generally accepted, its origins lying in the vestiges of the hepatic ducts. Resection of the overling dome is the usual treatment of exteriorised biliary cysts.

Experimental work on endoscopic treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding is under way in several medical centers. A variety of methods are being tested: laser photocoagulation, suture clip placement and the use of bioco+mpatible tissue glues. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography now is established as a useful technic in the diagnosis of biliary tract disease. Its diagnostic usefulness in the pancreas is confined to certain diseases in which it is desirable to determine the need for operative intervention. The initial success of endoscopic papillotomy and stone extraction promises further future therapeutic uses for ERCP. Colonoscopy may well prove to be the most useful of the gastrointestinal endoscopic methods. It is particularly helpful in diagnosing colonic cancer, in determining the source of occult colonic bleeding and in providing information regarding idiopathic colonic inflammatory disease. The success of polypectomy indicates the possibility of substituting endoscopic treatment for invasive surgery. Laparoscopy in conscious patients is a well-established technic that is useful in gastroenterology, hepatology, oncology and gynecology.

The risk however is low if an appropriate technique is used. In our series the gallbladder was punctured in 110 cases; a local peritonitis subsiding under conservative treatment occured as a complication in only one case. Peritoneoscopic puncture of the gallbladder is indicated in the following conditions: extrahepatic occlusion of the bile duct system of unknown origin, nonvisualization of the gallbladder during cholangiography, biliary dyskinesia, typical biliary colics with normal X-ray findings. In addition, gallbladder puncture should be done if any suspicion of gallbladder disease arises during peritoneoscopy.

Histologic examination was necessary to confirm whether the lipid metabolism in the liver of patients would be influenced by hepatic disease or not. The most significant differences between malignant and benign cases were observed when the ratio of fatty acid content of the phospholipid fraction to that of triglyceride was calculated for each patient. These ratios were over 2.20 in 40 cases out of 47 malignant neoplastic cases without benign hepatic diseases and in 3 out of 4 malignant neoplastic cases combined with benign hepatic diseases, but were under 2.19 in 35 benign cases.

In 6 cases these effects persisted with spironolactone and low salt diet only, probably because of better renal perfusion and re-established sensitivity to the diuretic treatment. One year follow up revealed 4 cases out of 13 without relapse. Rapid emptying of the peritoneal cavity permitted two laparoscopies, which revealed the tumoral origin of the ascites in two cases, and one laparotomy for porto-caval shunt in bleeding esophageal varices at the earliest possible juncture. This method of treating cirrhotic ascites is simple and well tolerated. It considerably shortens the hospitalization and may rapidly improve general conditions of life in these chronic patients."
CD009323,0,129699,0,[Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis (author's transl)].,"The large number of pancreas tests recommended today shows that no single method is satisfactory. In general, the rule holds that invasive methods are relatively conclusive and non-invasive are unreliable. In this report it is shown that by a rational combination of simple tests, a reliable procedure for pancreatic diagnosis in about 75% of cases is possible for the general practitioner. The methods described in recent years, such as scintigraphy, ultrasonography, angiography and retrograde pancreaticography are complicated and require great experience. In combination, they raise the accuracy to about 95%. Individual investigators can specialize in only one or a few of these methods. Diagnosis of pancreatic conditions which exceed the facilities of the doctor in practice is only possible in large centers or through co-operation of several specialists."
CD009323,0,128666,0,[Carcinoma of the pancreas: clinical signs and diagnostic procedures (author's transl)].,"The patients seen at the medical clinic of a community hospital over 6 years included 291 with diseases of the pancreas, 52 of whom had carcinoma of the pancreas. Their signs and symptoms are listed. The triad of weight loss, icterus, and abdominal pain was the commonest symptom cluster. In one third of the cases the serum lipase was raised though the blood level of amylase was normal. Laparoscopy led to exploratory laparotomy in 94 percent of cases, which was performed an average of 14 days later. The future will show whether ERCP (+cytology) and CEA will improve the possibility of early diagnosis."

CD009323,0,130232,0,"[""Surgical"" laparoscopy indications and value].","From 1971-1973, 1046 patients underwent laparoscopy in the gynecological department; 256 of the cases were surgical problems. In contrast to gastroenterological laparoscopy, surgical laparoscopy was performed in the operating room under general anaesthesia and everything prepared for immediate surgery. Major surgical interventions--if necessary--were performed immediately after laparoscopy. Indications for surgical laparoscopy were the following: preoperative evaluation of nature, extent and eventual metastases of tumors. Preoperative differentiation of acute and chronic appendicitis from other affections, particularly in younger female patients. Suspected intraabdominal hemorrhage of traumatic or non-traumatic origin. Evaluation of pathological palpatory findings in the abdominal cavity. Differential diagnosis of chronic relapsing intraabdominal complaints of unknown origin. Differential diagnosis of putrid, tuberculous or carcinomatous peritonitis with eventual biopsy. Preoperative evaluation of questions concerning surgery of liver, gallbladder or pancreas in connection with occlusive jaundice, hepatic cirrhosis or malignancy. The results of this study show, that by laparoscopy in over 50% of the patients, major surgical interventions could be avoided. Contraindications were primarily limited to pulmonal or cardiac insufficiency. The only complication (intestinal perforation), was adequately dealt with under the given operative conditions."
CD009323,0,123500,0,[Prognosis of cirrhosis of the liver (15-year follow-up from time of first manifestation (author's transl)].,"114 patients with cryptogenic or ""hepatitic"" cirrhosis of the liver (toxic or biliary causes excluded) were followed for a period of 15 years. The time of first manifestation of the disease was known because all patients had been in hospital or under serial outpatient observation, with clinical and biopsy studies every six months for chronic hepatitis. In addition, diagnosis of the liver cirrhosis was confirmed by laparoscopy and histomorphology, which further confirmed the exact timing of first manifestation. In 37 patients (32.5%) the disease healed out completely by way of reactionless fibrosis after, in some of them, a long period of observation, while in 47 (41.2%) the active disease continued, and 30 (26.3%) died in liver coma or bleeding from varices or surgical shunt procedures or from carcinoma of the liver. Prognosis of cirrhosis of the liver is thus much better than previously thought."
CD009323,0,122796,0,Recent developments in gastrointestinal endoscopy.,"Endoscopic findings can be extremely valuable in directing or altering specific treatment. Endoscopy also has therapeutic applications, such as removal of polyps (gastric or colonic), coagulation of bleeding sites in cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and the removal of foreign objects from the gastrointestinal tract. Laparoscopy is an easily performed procedure with minimal risk. On of its greatest values is in investigating diseases of the liver. Coloscopy has many uses, including evaluation of equivocal x-ray findings and histologic confirmation of cancer. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a new, highly sophisticated procedure that offers a major advantage in investigating pancreatic disease and evaluating jaundice."

CD009323,0,4256596,0,Fibrin degradation products and ovarian tumours.,"Fibrin degradation products (F.D.P.) were determined in the serum of 163 women in whom ovarian tumours had been suspected on palpation at gynaecological examination and who were afterwards examined by laparoscopy or subjected to laparotomy. F.D.P. were found in the serum (0.5-30 mg/100 ml) of 23 (72%) out of 32 patients with malignant tumours. Of 131 patients with benign findings F.D.P. (traces to 2 mg/100 ml) were found in six (4.5%), and in most of these the occurrence of F.D.P. could be explained on other clinical grounds. The findings suggest that the examination of F.D.P. in suspected malignant ovarian tumour may be of diagnostic value.Determination of F.D.P. in malignant ascitic fluid showed very high values, ranging between 40 and 350 mg/ 100 ml. This argues for the occurrence of F.D.P. in the blood being due to an extravascular breakdown of fibrin caused by tumour cells, but they may also be due to thromboplastic and fibrinolytic agents from the tumour entering the blood stream."
