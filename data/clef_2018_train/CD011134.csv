CD011134,0,23132294,0,KiSS-1 methylation and protein expression patterns contribute to diagnostic and prognostic assessments in tissue specimens for colorectal cancer.,"KISS1 is a metastasis suppressor lost in several solid malignancies. We evaluated the clinical relevance of KiSS-1 methylation and its protein expression in colorectal cancer. The epigenetic silencing of KiSS-1 by hypermethylation was tested in colon cancer cells (n = 5) before and after azacytidine treatment. KiSS-1 methylation was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR in colorectal cancer cells, and normal, benign, and tumor tissues (n = 352) were grouped in a training set (n = 62) and two independent validation cohorts (n = 100 and n = 190). KiSS-1 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on tissue arrays. KiSS-1 hypermethylation correlated with transcript and protein expression loss, being increased in vitro by azacytidine. Methylation rates were 53.1, 70.0, and 80.0 % in the training and validation sets, respectively. In the training set, KiSS-1 methylation rendered a diagnostic accuracy of 72.7 % (p = 0.002). Combination of KiSS-1 methylation and serum CEA (p = 0.001) increased the prognostic utility of CEA alone (p = 0.022). In the first validation set, KiSS-1 methylation correlated with tumor grade (p = 0.011), predicted recurrence (p = 0.009), metastasis (p = 0.004), disease-free (p = 0.034), and overall survival (p = 0.015). In the second validation cohort, KiSS-1 methylation predicted disease-specific survival (p = 0.030). In the training set, cytoplasmic KiSS-1 expression was significantly higher in nonneoplastic biopsies as compared to colorectal tumors (p < 0.0005). In the validation set, loss of cytoplasmic expression correlated with tumor stage (p = 0.007), grade (p = 0.035), recurrence (p = 0.017), and disease-specific survival (p = 0.022). KiSS-1 was revealed epigenetically modified in colorectal cancer. The diagnostic and prognostic utility of KiSS-1 methylation and expression patterns suggests their assessment for the clinical management of colorectal cancer patients."
CD011134,0,21901559,0,Peripheral blood guanylyl cyclase c (GCC) expressions are associated with prognostic parameters and response to therapy in colorectal cancer patients.,"Guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) is expressed exclusively in normal intestinal mucosal cells, primary and metastatic colorectal cancers (CRC). The aim of this study was to determine the possible association between the GCC expressions in peripheral blood, prognostic parameters and response to chemotherapy in CRC patients. Fourty-nine metastatic CRC patients and 41 healthy controls with similar age and sex were included to this study. Peripheral blood GCC expressions are measured by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Interstingly, no GCC expression was measured in healthy controls but GCC expressions of the patients were detectable. Although there was a significant reduction in GCC expressions in 30 patients with regression (from 5.46 ± 4.12 to 0.06 ± 0.03, p < 0.0001), marked increase in GCC expressions was observed in 19 patients with progression following chemotherapy (from 0.43 ± 0.19 to 1.38 ± 0.52, p = 0.0174). Significant correlation was found between the GCC expressions and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels (p = 0.0041) in 30 patients with regression before chemotherapy. Marked correlation was also detected between the GCC expressions and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (p = 0.0072) in 19 patients with progression before chemotherapy. The results of the present study suggest that peripheral blood GCC expressions along with CEA and CA19-9 can be used to determine the early respose to chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRC. These findings imply that higher expression of GCC in peripheral blood seems to be an indicator of good therapeutic response to chemotherapy and remission. Monitoring the peripheral blood GCC expressions may allow employing different treatment options to metastatic CRC patients."

To be able to determine patients prone to early recurrence, the use of different markers with a better prognostic value than the routinely employed tumor markers is required."
CD011134,0,16864976,0,Nucleosomes in colorectal cancer patients during radiochemotherapy.,"Apoptotic markers and tumor-associated antigens might be suitable to indicate the response to radiochemotherapy early. We analyzed the courses of nucleosomes, CEA, CA 19-9 and CYFRA 21-1 in 25 colorectal cancer patients during radiochemotherapy (4 postoperative, 13 preoperative, 8 local relapse therapy). Blood was taken before therapy, daily during the first week, once weekly during the following weeks, and at the end of the radiochemotherapy. After a temporary decline 6 h after the first irradiation, nucleosomes rose in most patients rapidly reaching a maximum during the first days which was followed by a subsequent decrease. In patients receiving postoperative therapy after complete resection of tumor, nucleosome levels generally were lower than in patients with preoperative or relapse therapy. Correspondingly, CEA, CA 19-9 and CYFRA 21-1 levels of postoperatively treated patients were the lowest whereas those with tumor relapse had the highest ones. During preoperative therapy, lower nucleosome concentrations were found in patients with response to therapy resulting in a smaller area under the curve of days 1-3 (AUC) than in those with progressive disease (p = 0.028). The other parameters did not indicate the response to therapy at the initial treatment phase. In conclusion, the course of nucleosomes (AUC) might be valuable for the early prediction of therapy response in preoperatively treated colorectal cancer patients."

CD011134,0,8146525,1,Use of CA 19-9 in the early detection of recurrences in colorectal cancer: comparison with CEA.,The serum levels of CA 19-9 were determined in the follow-up of 370 patients with colorectal cancer and compared with CEA. An increase in CA 19-9 preceded clinical diagnosis of recurrence in 25% of 72 patients. The mean time between the rise in CA 19-9 and clinical diagnosis of relapse was 3.7 months (median 3). Sensitivity of CA 19-9 in the early diagnosis of recurrence was much lower than that obtained for CEA (75%). Only 1 patient had elevated CA 19-9 levels and normal CEA.
CD011134,0,7863220,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen in staging and follow-up of patients with solid tumors.,"The presence of a tumor antigen in human colonic carcinomas and their metastases was described about 25 years ago. This antigen, called carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), is one of the first known tumor markers. Since then, many more have been described, but CEA, determined alone or in combination with others, is still one of the most used. CEA is not organ specific and abnormal values may be found in a wide range of carcinomas, especially those with gastrointestinal involvement. CEA assay should not be used for cancer diagnosis because its sensitivity in patients without cancer metastases is low. In addition, abnormal CEA values may be found in patients with benign diseases. However, the probability of malignancy increases directly with CEA concentration. Its main clinical applications are prognosis, early diagnosis of recurrence and follow-up of patients with carcinomas. In a wide range of malignancies, CEA serum levels are clearly related to tumor stage. Presurgical CEA serum levels are a well-established prognostic factor in colorectal, breast and lung cancer. Patients presenting with increased preoperative CEA serum levels have both a shorter disease-free interval and lower survival than those with normal CEA levels. In the early diagnosis of recurrence, CEA also plays an important role: in about 70-85% of patients with colorectal tumors and in 40-50% with breast cancer, CEA serial increase is the first sign of tumor recurrence. In patients with disseminated tumors, serial determinations are also a useful tool for therapy monitoring: CEA values decrease with effective treatment while stable or increasing values are observed when treatment is not effective."
CD011134,0,2437641,0,"Clinical usefulness of three monoclonal antibody-defined tumor markers: CA 19-9, CA 50, and CA 125.","This article reviews the clinical usefulness of three monoclonal antibody-defined tumor markers: CA 19-9 or GICA, CA 50, and CA 125. These markers have been regarded as worthwhile tools for diagnosis and monitoring the management of patients with cancers in selected sites. The CA 19-9 test in combination with the CEA test is a useful adjunct for staging in some advanced cases and for monitoring therapy in the majority of patients with carcinoma of the stomach. Sensitivity of these assays performed concurrently is comparable to CEA alone in colorectal carcinoma. The CA 19-9 test alone is useful for staging and monitoring management of patients with carcinoma of the pancreas. In colorectal carcinoma the CA 19-9 test is redundant because of significantly lower sensitivity than that of the CEA assay; the latter remains the test of choice. The CA 50 test per se is redundant since the CA 19-9 antigen is the target for both the C50 MAb and the NS 19-9 MAb. The CA 125 test contributes to staging and is a useful adjunct for monitoring management of patients with non-mucinous carcinomas of the ovary. If positive after initial surgery and chemotherapy, this test provides evidence of the presence of residual or metastatic tumor and thus may obviate the need for second-look surgery. These conclusions are based on a review of recent relevant publications as well as on our own results obtained from preoperative evaluation and postoperative follow-up of about 600 patients with cancers in relevant sites."
CD011134,0,24451945,0,Role of paxillin in colorectal carcinoma and its relationship to clinicopathological features.,"Colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common malignant tumors. Despite advances in therapy, mortality is still very high. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of paxillin in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW480 and its role in cell cycle and apoptosis. We also investigated the expression of paxillin in colorectal carcinoma tissues and its relationship to clinicopathological features and survival."

CD011134,0,24423964,0,[A case of advanced sigmoid colon cancer with metastases in the liver and the paraaortic lymph nodes successfully treated with 5-FU/l-LV and FOLFOX4 followed by S-1 leading to long-term complete response].,"The patient was a 70-year-old woman with sigmoid colon cancer and metastases in the liver and the paraaortic lymph nodes. We performed sigmoidectomy along with lymph node dissection. The solitary hepatic metastasis was 3 cm in diameter; however, hepatectomy was not performed because metastases in the paraaortic lymph nodes persisted. The serum carcino embryonic antigen(CEA)level was above 200 ng/mL, both preoperatively and postoperatively. After surgery, chemo- therapy was initiated. Initially, weekly 5-fluorouracil and l / -Leucovorin(5-FU/l-LV)therapy was administered 4 times. Subsequently, 5-FU/folinic acid plus oxaliplatin(FOLFOX4)therapy was administered 12 times every 2 weeks. Thereafter, S-1 therapy(orally, 40 mg twice a day, 28 days, followed by 14 days of rest)was initiated. After 3 months of chemotherapy, serum CEA levels decreased rapidly to within the normal limit. Paraaortic lymph node metastases and the hepatic metastasis disappeared after 3 months and 11 months, respectively. S-1 therapy was continued for over 7 years. Currently, it has been over 1 year since the discontinuation of S-1 therapy, and complete response has been maintained for over 9 years since the surgery."

This study prospectively investigates the diagnostic accuracy of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for staging and detection of recurrence in primary CC.
CD011134,0,24195503,0,The role of tumor markers and biomarkers in colorectal cancer.,"A steady increase in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality has been observed in Europe, despite the continuous advancement in diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Accordingly, further progress is very much desirable in non-invasive diagnostic methods to enable early diagnosis, preand postoperative staging, and to assist in selecting the most suitable neo-adjuvant and adjuvant therapeutic methods and post-treatment follow-up. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about the role of tumor markers and biomarkers in CRC diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. New biomarkers which are absent in healthy persons and present in CRC are still being investigated, especially those that can be detected at early development stage of the disease and used in screening tests. Unfortunately, no molecule that would meet all of the foregoing criteria has been identified so far. Carcinoembryonic antigen still remains the only tumor marker of recognised efficacy in monitoring patients during and after CRC therapy. Clinical studies and retrospective analyses allowed to discover and introduce to the clinical practice several bioindicators that assist in selecting the proper chemotherapeutic drug. There are attempts to ""personalise"" chemotherapy based on presence or absence of specific biomarkers. Therapy with anti-EGFR antibodies is desirable in patients with advanced CRC and absence of KRAS or BRAF mutation. Defining tumor phenotype - microsatellite instability (MSI) or microsatellite stability (MSS) and testing for the presence or absence of 18q chromosome deletion is very much desirable in standard 5-FU-based therapy. Analysis of UGT1A1 alleles may be the basis for modified dosing and reducing the potential toxicity of irinotecan. Studies on CRC biomarkers need to continue to closely examine the relationship between therapy and CRC curability. Targeted therapy against membrane receptors appears to be the future of CRC therapy."
CD011134,0,24393990,0,[A case of pathologically complete response of local recurrence in the mesorectum after multidisciplinary therapy].,"The patient was a 68-year-old man who had undergone sigmoidectomy 1 year previously. Adjuvant therapy with tegafur- uraci(l UFT) and Leucovorin( UZEL) was administered. Seven months later, the carcinoembryonic antigen( CEA) level increased to 7.5 ng/mL. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a 4-cm mass in the mesorectum, and the patient was diagnosed as having local recurrence. Chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and Leucovorin( mFOLFOX6) and radiation therapy( 60 Gy) were administered. As the tumor could not be detected after chemoradiotherapy, abdominoperineal resection was performed. Pathological examination showed no cancer and indicated a complete response. The patients CEA level has not increased and no recurrence has been detected on enhanced CT for 3.5 years. The tumor could be decreased in size by chemoradiotherapy and the operation could be safely performed without resecting other organs. Although surgery is generally performed for local recurrence, multidisciplinary therapy could be useful in performing such surgery safely."
CD011134,0,24393859,0,[Analysis of the eligibility of elderly colorectal cancer patients for adjuvant chemotherapy combined with polysaccharide K].,"We enrolled 62 elderly patients( ≥70 years of age) with colorectal cancer who had undergone surgery and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy at our department and analyzed the overall surviva(l OS) and disease-free surviva(l DFS) to identify the patients who responded to treatment. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was performed with oral anticancer agents, including doxifluridine( 5'-DFUR), uracil/tegafur( UFT), and UFT/Leucovorin( LV); all patients also received polysaccharide K( PSK), an immunomodulator, in combination with chemotherapy. The 3-year OS and DFS rates for all patients were 83.4% and 78.6%, respectively, with no significant differences in these rates based on the chemotherapeutic agents used. The patients were assigned to low and high groups on the basis of the median cut-off values of each clinical laboratory parameter and the data obtained were subjected to univariate analysis. The results of the univariate analysis suggested that carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) levels were significant prognostic factors. Further multivariate analysis using Cox regression analysis identified the preoperative CEA level alone as an independent factor. When stratification analysis was performed using a preoperative CEA level of 4.0 ng/mL as the cut-off value, the results indicated that the outcome of patients with a high preoperative CEA level may be 8-fold worse than that of patients with a low preoperative CEA level. For these patients, the use of chemotherapeutic drugs that elicit a more potent antitumor effect should be considered."

CD011134,0,24335376,0,[A case of local recurrence of rectal carcinoma 10 years after initial surgery].,"Here, we report an extremely rare case of local recurrence of rectal cancer 10 years after initial tumor resection. A 53-year-old man underwent abdominoperineal resection for advanced rectal cancer at a local hospital. The tumor was graded as pStage II (pA, pN0, pH0, pP0, pM0, curA)as per the Japanese Classification of Colorectal Carcinoma, seventh edition, and diagnosed as a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma on histopathological examination. Subsequently, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy for 5 years. Although the patient lived without any recurrences after adjuvant chemotherapy, unfortunately, blood examination showed a high carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA)level 10 years after the initial surgical treatment. Computed tomography(CT)and positron emission tomography(PET)/CT revealed a perineal tumor, 40mm in size, without other distant metastases. On diagnosis of local recurrence of rectal cancer, the patient underwent surgical tumor resection at Okayama University Hospital. The tumor was determined to be a well- to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma by histopathological examination, suggesting local recurrence of the primary rectal adenocarcinoma. Moreover, the radial margin was free of cancer. The patient is now doing well without any re-recurrence 30 months after the second surgical treatment, without any adjuvant chemotherapy."
CD011134,0,24331320,0,Microsatellite instability in the management of stage II colorectal patients.,"Up-to-date it is unclear whether stage II colorectal cancer patients should receive adjuvant chemotherapy.The presence of high risk features (T4, CEA 5 ng dl, less than 12 lymph nodes examined) is an indication for Oxaliplatin based treatment. In their absence, there is no consensus, 5 Fluorouracil regimens, or observation only being equally recommended by oncologists. Microsatellite instability is associated with good prognosis in stage II colorectal cancer and also with poor response to 5 Fluorouracil and should be used as a predictive marker."

CD011134,0,24231712,0,"[A case wherein bevacizumab/XELOX combination therapy was remarkably effective for the treatment of extensive dissemination in advanced colon cancer, and the primary lesion could be resected].","Here, we report a case wherein bevacizumab/XELOX combination therapy was remarkably effective for the treatment of a patient with unresectable advanced cecum cancer and carcinomatous peritonitis. A 52-year-old man was diagnosed with cecum cancer with extensive carcinomatous dissemination. He underwent open laparotomy, and the findings indicated a unresectable cecal tumor attached to the retroperitoneum; therefore, ileo-transverse colostomy was performed. After 6 courses of bevacizumab and XELOX therapy, the primary tumor as well as ascites and carcinomatous dissemination had disappeared, and a marked decrease in the serum carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA)level was noted. However, subsequently, positive emission tomography/computed tomography(PET/CT)indicated a recurrence of the primary tumor. Therefore, ileocecalectomy and D2 lymph node dissection were performed. Thus, we believe that bevacizumab/XELOX therapy may be useful as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced colon cancer with peritonitis carcinomatosa."

CD011134,0,24133632,0,Metformin use and improved response to therapy in rectal cancer.,"Locally advanced rectal cancer is commonly treated with chemoradiation prior to total mesorectal excision (TME). Studies suggest that metformin may be an effective chemopreventive agent in this disease as well as a possible adjunct to current therapy. In this study, we examined the effect of metformin use on pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and outcomes in rectal cancer. The charts of 482 patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated from 1996 to 2009 with chemoradiation and TME were reviewed. Median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (range 19.8-63). Nearly, all patients were treated with concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (98%) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (81.3%). Patients were categorized as nondiabetic (422), diabetic not taking metformin (40), or diabetic taking metformin (20). No significant differences between groups were found in clinical tumor classification, nodal classification, tumor distance from the anal verge or circumferential extent, pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level, or pathologic differentiation. pCR rates were 16.6% for nondiabetics, 7.5% for diabetics not using metformin, and 35% for diabetics taking metformin, with metformin users having significantly higher pCR rates than either nondiabetics (P = 0.03) or diabetics not using metformin (P = 0.007). Metformin use was significantly associated with pCR rate on univariate (P = 0.05) and multivariate (P = 0.01) analyses. Furthermore, patients taking metformin had significantly increased disease-free (P = 0.013) and overall survival (P = 0.008) compared with other diabetic patients. Metformin use is associated with significantly higher pCR rates as well as improved survival. These promising data warrant further prospective study."

CD011134,0,23888604,0,Role of carcinoembryonic antigen as a marker for colorectal liver metastases.,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a marker for colorectal adenocarcinoma, can monitor disease progression and treatment response. This study aims to determine the accuracy of CEA in the detection and resectability of colorectal liver metastases. Patients with primary colorectal cancer were divided into three groups: resectable hepatic metastases (group 1), unresectable metastases (group 2), and disease-free cases (group 3). The CEA concentration was recorded pre- and post-hepatectomy in group 1 and on radiological confirmation of disease state in the other groups. It was expressed as median (95% confidence interval [CI]), with predictors of concentration determined. Group 1 (n=141) had pre-operative CEA of 8.9 (4.6-13.1), with 38.1% of patients being normal. Maximum tumour diameter correlated with CEA level (r=0.41, P<0.0001). Post-hepatectomy CEA was 2.3 (1.9-2.7; P<0.0001), with 81.1% of patients being normal. Group 2 (n=158) had CEA of 20.6 (9.4-31.9). Group 3 (n=361) had CEA of 2.0 (1.8-2.2). Sensitivity of CEA pre- and post-hepatectomy was 61.2% and 69.3%, respectively, while specificity was 79.8% for both groups. Concentration was elevated in hepatic colorectal metastases but is not a marker of resectability. A CEA reduction post-resection indicates that it may be used as an indicator of treatment response, while CEA is increased by tumour burden and lesion size."

The surgical findings were sSE, sN2, sP3, sStage IV, and histopathological findings were signet-ring cell carcinoma, pSE, pN2, pP+, pStage IV. After 8 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with modified 5-fluorouracil/Leucovorin/oxaliplatin(mFOLFOX6), carcinoembryonic antigen( CEA)decreased to a normal level, and positron emission tomography-computed tomography(PET-CT)showed no abnormal accumulation that suggested metastasis. To evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure, laparoscopic peritoneal biopsy was performed 5 months after surgery, revealing histopathological disappearance of the peritoneal dissemination lesion. The patient has been followed up and has been receiving S-1 for 1 year after the first surgery. No evidence of recurrence has been observed."

CD011134,0,23692875,0,[History of tumor markers for cancers of the digestive system].,"Tumor markers are gene products which signal the occurrence of tumors in different organs as well as their response to surgery and chemotherapy. The discovery of tumor markers occurred after the demonstration of tumor-specific transplantation antigens in chemically or virally induced tumors in syngenic rodents. The history of currently used tumor markers began in the 1940s, the first discovered being alpha-fetoprotein in 1956, followed by that of carcinoembryonic antigen in 1965. Since then the range of tumor markers has widened continously. Their chemical structure and genetics is now well known. Some may play part in tumor growth and development of metastases. The potential uses of tumor markers are general or high risk population screening, adjunct in diagnosis of cancer, preoperative indicator of tumor burden, indicator of therapeutic success, evidence of postoperative recurrences and use in tumor localization. However, there is no ideal tumor marker fulfilling all the criteria.

CD011134,0,23642239,0,Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-armed oncolytic measles virus is an effective therapeutic cancer vaccine.,"Oncolytic measles viruses (MV) derived from the live attenuated vaccine strain have been engineered for increased antitumor activity, and are currently under investigation in clinical phase 1 trials. Approaches with other viral vectors have shown that insertion of immunomodulatory transgenes enhances the therapeutic potency. In this study, we engineered MV for expression of the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). For the first time, therapeutic efficacy and adaptive immune response in the context of MV oncolysis could be evaluated in the previously established immunocompetent murine colon adenocarcinoma model MC38cea. MC38cea cells express the human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), allowing for infection with retargeted MV. Intratumoral application of MV-GMCSF significantly delayed tumor progression and prolonged median overall survival compared with control virus-treated mice. Importantly, more than one-third of mice treated with MV-GMCSF showed complete tumor remission and rejected successive tumor reengraftment, demonstrating robust long-term protection. An enhanced cell-mediated tumor-specific immune response could be detected by lactate dehydrogenase assay and interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Furthermore, MV-GMCSF treatment correlated with increased abundance of tumor-infiltrating CD3(+) lymphocytes analyzed by quantitative microscopy of tumor sections. These findings underline the potential of oncolytic, GM-CSF-expressing MV as an effective therapeutic cancer vaccine actively recruiting adaptive immune responses for enhanced therapeutic impact and tumor elimination. Thus, the treatment benefit of this combined immunovirotherapy approach has direct implications for future clinical trials."

CD011134,0,23560382,0,Diagnostic use of epitope detection in monocytes blood test for early detection of colon cancer metastasis.,"A follow-up strategy in cancer aftercare can result in early detection of metastasis and/or recurrence. Therefore, sensitive and reliable diagnostic tests that are easy to perform are needed. Here, the authors present the combined use of the epitope detection in monocytes (EDIM)-TKTL1 and EDIM-Apo10 blood test in aftercare monitoring of a patient with colon carcinoma. Whereas the established tumor markers CEA and CA19-9 did not indicate metastasis even at a timepoint where clinical signs and imaging techniques already demonstrated metastasis, the combined application of the EDIM-TKTL1 and the EDIM-Apo10 blood tests was positive 9 months before detection of metastasis. These findings - taken together with recently published evaluation data of the EDIM-TKTL1 blood test - suggest that the combined application of the EDIM-TKTL1 and the EDIM-Apo10 blood tests might indicate metastasis earlier than established tumor markers and could serve as sensitive and noninvasive methods that might be used for early detection of colon cancer metastasis."
CD011134,0,23557862,0,Detection of cadherin-17 in human colon cancer LIM1215 cell secretome and tumour xenograft-derived interstitial fluid and plasma.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most prevalent cancers in the western world, is treatable if detected early. However, 70% of CRC is detected at an advanced stage. This is largely due to the inadequacy of current faecal occult blood screening testing and costs involved in conducting population-based colonoscopy, the 'gold standard' for CRC detection. Another biomarker for CRC, carcinoembryonic antigen, while useful for monitoring CRC recurrence, is ineffective, lacking the specificity required early detection of CRC. For these reasons there is a need for more effective blood-based markers for early CRC detection. In this study we targeted glycoproteins secreted from the human colon carcinoma cell line LIM1215 as a source of potential CRC biomarkers. Secreted candidate glycoproteins were confirmed by MS and validated by Western blot analysis of tissue/tumour interstitial fluid (Tif) from LIM1215 xenograft tumours grown in immunocompromised mice. Overall, 39 glycoproteins were identified in LIM1215 culture media (CCM) and 5 glycoproteins in LIM1215 tumour xenograft Tif; of these, cadherin-17 (CDH17), galectin-3 binding protein (LGALS3BP), and tyrosine-protein kinase-like 7 (PTK7) were identified in both CM and glycosylation motifs. Swiss-Prot was used to annotate Tif. Many of the glycoproteins identified in this study (e.g., AREG, DSG2, EFNA1, EFNA3, EFNA4, EPHB4, ST14, and TIMP1) have been reported to be implicated in CRC biology. Interestingly, the cadherin-17 ectodomain, but not full length cadherin-17, was identified in CM, Tif and plasma derived from mice bearing the LIM1215 xenograft tumour. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the cadherin-17 ectodomain in plasma. In this study, we report for the first time that the presence of full-length cadherin-17 in exosomes released into the CM. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: An Updated Secretome."

Total 470 patients who fulfilled inclusion criteria were selected for a further 10-year follow-up study. We found that there were statistical significance between non-transfused and transfused group in mortality (P=0.018), local recurrence (P=0.000) and distant metastasis (P=0.040). Local recurrence and distant metastasis between 1 to 3 units and more than 3 units group did not show any significant differences. There was no difference in survival rate between non-transfused and 1 to 3 units group (log rank =0.031, P=0.860). The difference between different blood transfusion volume in transfused patients was found (78.77% vs 63.83%, P=0.006). Meanwhile, the significant difference of survival rate was existed between non-transfused group and more than 3 units group (84.83% vs 63.83%, P=0.002 ). Univariate analysis showed the following 3 variables to be associated with an increased risk of allogeneic blood transfusions: preoperative CEA level (P<0.05), location of tumor (P<0.01) and diameter of tumor (P<0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that location of tumor and diameter of tumor are two independent factors for requirement of perioperative transfusions. Therefore, allogeneic transfusion increase the postoperative tumor mortality, local recurrence and distant metastasis in patients with stage II colon cancer. The postoperative tumor mortality, local recurrence and distant metastasis were not associated with the blood transfusion volume. The blood transfusion volume was associated with the survival rate. Location of tumor and diameter of tumor were the independent preoperative risk factors for blood transfusion."

CD011134,0,23420146,0,Serum tumor markers and PET/CT imaging for tumor recurrence detection.,"When confronted with a suspicious rise in CA 15.3 in asymptomatic breast cancer patients following primary treatment and negative or equivocal conventional imaging findings, FDG PET/CT allows assessment of the site and extent of the recurring disease with an accuracy of 83%. Both FDG PET and FDG PET/CT are superior when compared to CT alone for the purpose of recurrence detection in patients suffering from ovarian carcinoma who have completed primary therapy but demonstrate a rising serum CA-125 level. As the global accuracy of CT alone for detection of recurrence of ovarian cancer approximates 80%, CT scan should be performed upfront to identify the site of recurrence. When confronted with negative or equivocal CT findings, FDG PET alone or FDG PET/CT should be added. In patients with rising serum CEA levels that have undergone primary treatment for a colorectal carcinoma, both FDG PET and FDG PET/CT allow detection of tumor recurrence with an accuracy of 95%, well above that of CT and MRI. Available studies further suggest that FDG/PET findings will affect treatment management in 28-50% of these patients. The detection rate of both 11C-choline and 18F-choline PET and PET/CT for local, regional, and distant recurrence in prostate carcinoma patients with a biochemical recurrence increases with rising PSA value at the time of imaging and reaches about 75% in patients with PSA > 3 ng/mL.

CD011134,0,23252563,0,Prognostic factors after resection of colorectal liver metastases: from morphology to biology.,"Despite improved overall survival rates after potentially curative liver resection (~50-58% at 5 years), almost half of patients experience disease recurrence highlighting the need for a precise definition of outcomes to stratify patients for clinical trials and to guide treatment decisions. In the past, several factors, such as an advanced primary T stage, the primary N+ status, a large tumor size, multiple tumors, a disease-free interval of <12 months, an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level, the presence of an extrahepatic disease, and the margin width (<1 cm) and status (positive), have been recognized to predict poor outcomes, but most of them lack the sensitivity for accurate individual prognostication. Thus, in recent years, new factors, such as response to chemotherapy, either clinical or pathological, that more closely reflect tumor biology have been established and adopted in the clinical practice. Similarly, biomarkers of poor prognosis, especially mutations in KRAS and BRAF and the expression of thymidylate synthase, have been studied, yielding promising results. However, robust evidence of their prognostic utility awaits prospective validation."

Serum biomarkers involved in immunogenic cell death are potentially valuable for early predicting therapy response and estimating prognosis. In a prospective observation study, blood samples were taken from 49 consecutive colorectal cancer patients with extensive hepatic metastases before, 24 and 48 hr after RE. Serum levels of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), receptor of glycation end products (RAGE) and activity of desoxyribonuclease were compared with response to therapy regularly determined radiologically 3 months after therapy and with overall survival. Serum levels of HMGB1 were increased already 24 hr after RE, while RAGE levels were decreased and DNAse remained unchanged. In radiological staging, 35 patients demonstrated disease progression while 14 patients had stable disease or remission. Serum HMGB1 levels 24 hr after RE were significantly higher in progressive than in nonprogressive patients while for RAGE and DNAse no difference was observed between the response groups. Concerning overall survival, high pretherapeutic (0 hr) and 24 hr levels of HMGB1 were associated with poor outcome. Multivariate analysis including HMGB1, tumor, liver and inflammation markers revealed HMGB1 and CRP as independent prognostic parameters. HMGB1 is a valuable serum biomarker for early estimation of therapy response and prognosis in colorectal cancer patients with liver metastases undergoing RE therapy."
CD011134,0,23040007,0,Transient therapy-related surge in serum tumor biomarkers: characterizing behavior and postulating its biologic role.,"A phenomenon of serum tumor biomarker surge or flare that ensues shortly after initiating cancer therapy and that may precede the actual therapeutic response-related decline is poorly understood and remains under-appreciated. However, it may have a significant clinical implication as it could be misinterpreted in clinical practice as therapeutic failure and lead to a premature discontinuation of potentially effective therapy. Therefore, in the present study, attempts have been made to understand the behavior of this phenomenon with respect to a reported median incidence, duration, and its relationship to clinical response. The results of these analyses suggest a significantly lower incidence of this phenomenon with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as determined in colorectal cancer and prostate specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer as compared to the other biomarkers studied (p=0.006). Furthermore, regardless of the type of biomarker or the extent of its incidence, a therapy-related initial surge appears to correlate with eventual response to therapy. Although, the biologic significance of this phenomenon is currently elusive, two distinct hypothesis-generating cases with CEA and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) are presented that, if supported by further research, would provide insights into the role of a biomarker surge in overall tumor growth control by cancer therapy."

CD011134,0,10228469,0,[Monitoring colorectal cancer after surgical resection].,"POSTOPERATIVE FOLLOW-UP: Despite adjuvant therapy, approximately 50% of all patients undergoing curative surgery for Dukes C colorectal cancer will develop a recurrence within 3-5 years and 95% of these will die from their cancer shortly thereafter. ENDOSCOPY: Generally performed every 3 years after checking that all cancerous foci have been removed, colonoscopy is required to detect adenomes and metachronic cancers. Its contribution to screening for local recurrence is however rather limited since most recurrences develop in an extraluminal localization. CEA: Assayed at 8 months, repeated carcinoembryonic antigen assay can detect asymptomatic recurrence in 50 to 60% of the cases, usually 4 to 8 months prior to other explorations. Specificity is high (85% to 95% depending on the series), allowing exploratory laparotomy if CEA alone is elevated. However, the only randomized study evaluating CEA was unable to demonstrate any prolongation of survival with monthly tests. OPTIMAL FOLLOW-UP: There is some debate about the usefulness of intensive clinical and radiographic follow-up as the 4 randomized studies available were unable to demonstrate any beneficial effect. It must be noted however that the number of patients included in these studies was too low to evidence a small improvement in survival rates. In France, a 6% improvement at 5 years would result in 200 fewer deaths due to Duke C colorectal cancer annually. A large multicentric randomized study will be initiated shortly in France to evaluate the impact of intensive CEA monitoring versus no monitoring and intensive versus periodical radiological follow-up."

It is also important to evaluate impact of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on local recurrence rate and survival. We used the data of 514 patients with rectal carcinoma treated at Clinic of surgery at University Hospital Centre in Osijek, during the period from 2000 to 2007. Routine follow-up was carried out until March of 2012 or death. Median life expectancy for all patients who underwent surgery was 98 months. 47% of patients with resection without residual tumor (R0) did not develop local recurrence after median of observation of 90 months. 5-year survival rate for patients with R0 resection was 76.4%. The patients who had preoperative serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) within the normal range (< 5 microg/mL) had a significantly better prognosis with 5-year survival of 75.8%, than patients with elevated levels who had 5-year survival of 46.5%. Tumor stage had great influence on survival and was defined by UICC TNM (International Union against Cancer, Tumor Node Metastases) classification, 7th edition. 5-year survival rate was (93.5% for stage I, 87.4% for stage II, 58.2% for stage III, 8.1% for stage IV). Patients with low grade differentiation tumors had 5-year survival rate of 73.5%, and those with high-grade had 38.2%. We have found that preoperative CRT significantly reduces the rate of local recurrence (5.3% vs. 14.1%), but patients who were treated with preoperative CRT did not appear to benefit significantly in terms of their long-term prognosis, because there was no difference in overall survival between the patients who received preoperative radiochemotherapy and those who did not receive it (66.2% vs. 67.8%). It was found that the R-classification, anatomical extent of tumor described by the TNM classification of the UICC, tumor grade, and preoperative CEA serum level were prognostic factors that influenced survival."

The measurement of S-p53 Ab was performed preoperatively and postoperatively in 16 stage II/III colorectal cancer patients with a high level of S-p53 Ab. A time course analysis of both S-p53 Ab and CEA levels was performed in 6 of these patients who were carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) positive. The median S-p53 Ab level was 29.9 U/mL and the half-life of the S-p53 Ab level was 40.3 days. In 4(25%) cases, the level of S-p53 Ab recovered to within normal limits by 79-142 days. When the half-lives of S-p53 Ab and CEA were analyzed in 6 patients who were both S-p53 Ab and CEA positive, the half-lives of S-p53 Ab and CEA were 32.3 and 13.2 days, respectively. In the case of recurrence with liver metastasis after resection of ascending colon cancer, the S-p53 Ab level did not respond quickly while the CEA level increased. Therefore, it is difficult to use the level of S-p53 Ab as a marker for monitoring treatment, and priority should be given to the examination of CEA and imaging modality."

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between preoperative nutritional conditions, including prealbumin and albumin concentrations, and the risk of recurrence in cases with operable colorectal carcinoma. One hundred fifty-eight patients who underwent elective colorectal resection were analyzed in this study. Of the eligible cases, 56 (35.4%) had decreased serum prealbumin and 15 (9.5%) had decreased serum albumin preoperatively. Among 158 cases in this study, 18 (11.4%) had disease recurrence. In the univariate analysis, the depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, serum albumin, prealbumin, and carcinoembryonic antigen were the factors significantly associated with disease recurrence. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only serum albumin was a predictor of the recurrence; however, serum prealbumin lost its significance on multivariate analysis. Time to tumor recurrence by Kaplan-Meier curves significantly differed among patients with low serum albumin and prealbumin level. Our results suggest that prealbumin and albumin may be sensitive indicators of the risk of recurrent disease; however, low serum albumin levels are more useful than prealbumin in predicting short-term disease recurrence in operable colorectal cancer."

The aim of the present study was to analyse the association between serum hCGβ recurrence, and survival, in patients with colorectal cancer. The concentrations of hCGβ were determined in serum collected preoperatively from 324 patients with colorectal cancer, of whom 270 were curatively treated. The serum concentrations of hCGβ were associated with increasing age and they were higher in women than in men. Using the 75th percentile (1.55 pmol/L) as a cut-off for serum hCGβ, overall survival (OS) was shorter in patients with elevated concentrations (HR 1.95; 95% CI 1.39-2.74; P=0.004), and this association was stronger in women (P=0.022) than in men (P=0.061). In multivariate analyses including age, disease stage, tumour differentiation, vascular invasion and CEA, high serum hCGβ concentrations remained an independent prognostic factor for adverse OS in women (HR 2.26; 95%CI 1.39-3.67), but not in men (HR 0.78; 95%CI 0.41-1.51).

In this work, a novel label-free resonance light scattering (RLS) spectral CEA assay was developed based on the combination of highly selective immunoreaction and ultrasensitive RLS technique. In Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 7.5), the specific immunoreaction between CEA antigen and mouse anti-CEA formed immune complexes which had a maximum RLS spectral peak at 389.0 nm, with the existence of physiological saline and polyethylene glycol 20,000 (PEG 20,000). Under the optimal conditions, the magnitude of enhanced RLS intensity (ΔI(RLS)) was proportional to the concentration of CEA in the range from 0.1 to 60 ng mL(-1), with a detection limit (LOD, 3σ) of 0.03 ng mL(-1). The characteristics of RLS, the CEA immunocomplex, the immune response, the ratio of CEA antigen and mouse anti-CEA, and the optimum conditions of the immunoreaction have been investigated. The CEA concentrations of 20 serum specimens detected by the developed assay showed consistent results in comparison with those obtained by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit.

There is much controversy not only regarding the most appropriate therapeutic approach in the neoadjuvant setting but also after surgery is performed. Many patients will experience early relapses but others will be long survivors. We need to establish reliable prognostic and predictive factors to offer a tailored treatment. Several prognostic factors after metastasectomy have been identified: high C-reactive protein levels, a high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, elevated neutrophil count and low serum albumin are related to a worst outcome. Elevated CEA and Ki 67 levels, intrahepatic and perihepatic lymph node invasion are also some of the markers related to a worst outcome. In contrast, the administration of preoperative chemotherapy has been associated with a better prognosis after hepatectomy. The administration of adjuvant chemotherapy should be done taking in consideration these factors. Regarding predictive factors, determination of ERCC1, TS, TP and DPD and UGT1 polymorphisms assessment could be considered prior to chemotherapy administration.

CD011134,0,22858794,0,Patient-clinician information engagement improves adherence to colorectal cancer surveillance after curative treatment: results from a longitudinal study.,"Introduction. Follow-up surveillance after curative treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is recommended to detect early cancer recurrences and improve survival outcomes. However, a substantial proportion of CRC patients do not undergo cancer surveillance. Several demographic and disease-related factors have been associated with cancer surveillance adherence. Thus far, patient-centered communication has not been studied as a determinant for undergoing cancer surveillance. The purpose of this study is to determine whether patient-clinician information engagement (PCIE) influences patients' self-reported adherence to recommended CRC surveillance procedures. Methods. The study was a longitudinal survey among Pennsylvanian patients diagnosed with CRC in 2005. CRC patients who were eligible for surveillance and participated in both the baseline and 1-year follow-up surveys were included in this analysis (n = 305). The main outcome measure was self-reported adherence to physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen testing, and colonoscopy according to recommended guidelines. Results. Controlling for potential confounders, higher PCIE at baseline predicted a higher odds for CRC patients reporting adherence to recommended surveillance 1 year later by 2.8 times. Other significant predictors of adhering to recommended surveillance were a higher education level and having received systemic therapy. Discussion. In this longitudinal study among CRC patients who received curative treatment, greater patient engagement with clinicians about cancer-related information was found to improve patients' subsequent adherence to recommended surveillance. This finding provides support for encouraging greater patient-physician communication among CRC patients."

A 56-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for the treatment of PALN recurrence in June 2005. She had undergone right hemicolectomy for ascending colon cancer two years earlier. The pathological diagnosis in 2003 was a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with positive PALN metastasis in 3 of 4 dissected nodes (T3, N1b, M1a, stage IVa). At our hospital, chemoradiotherapy was started, with the radiation field determined from positron emission tomography (PET) images. Oral tegafur/uracil (600 mg/day) plus leucovorin (75 mg/day) therapy was also started. Radiotherapy (1.5 Gy/ fraction, total of 45 Gy) was completed in August 2005, while oral chemotherapy was discontinued 3 weeks after it was started due to diarrhea and epigastric discomfort. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was 193 ng/ml (N < 5) before treatment and decreased to within normal limits 3 months after initiation of chemoradiotherapy. Complete remission was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) and PET in December 2005 and has continued for more than 6 years. This case shows that chemoradiotherapy is potentially curative for PALN recurrence from colorectal cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first report of more than 5 years disease-free survival in a patient with PALN recurrence from colon cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy."

CD011134,0,22159472,0,Regulatory T-cell-mediated inhibition of antitumor immune responses is associated with clinical outcome in patients with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.,"Adaptive regulatory T cells (Tregs) contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment in colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we examined whether the level of Treg-mediated inhibition of antitumor immune responses in patients with metastatic CRC (metCRC) selected for liver resection is associated with clinical outcome. Preoperatively and at follow-ups, we did flow-based phenotyping, examined antitumor immunity using peptides from carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) protein in the presence or absence of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(dim/-) cells (Tregs) and determined cytokine and PGE(2) levels in patient blood samples. At 18 months post-surgery, 8 patients were disease free (7 alive and 1 dead of unrelated cause) and 10 had experienced disease recurrence (7 alive and 3 dead of metCRC). Prior to surgery, the patients demonstrated Treg-mediated suppression of TNFα and IFNγ expression that could be perturbed through the PGE(2)/cAMP pathway and the immune suppression was significantly higher in the group that later developed disease recurrence (P = 0.046). Furthermore, the post-surgery plasma PGE(2) levels were related to the clinical outcome (PGE(2) levels of 280 ± 47 vs. 704 ± 153 pg/ml (mean ± SEM) for disease free and recurrent disease, respectively). T-cell phenotyping revealed higher frequencies of COX-2(+) cells in the patients with recurrent disease. These findings support the notion that the level of Treg-mediated suppression of adaptive antitumor immune responses at the time of surgery may influence later clinical outcome of metCRC and provide valuable prognostic information."

CD011134,0,21618511,0,Lymph node CEA and MUC2 mRNA as useful predictors of outcome in colorectal cancer.,"The aim was to explore the utility for staging and prognostic impact of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), guanylyl cyclase C (GCC), CUB (complement protein subcomponents C1r/C1s, urchin embryonic growth factor, and bone morphogenic protein 1) containing domain protein 1 (CDCP1) and mucin 2 (MUC2) mRNA levels in mesenteric lymph nodes of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Lymph nodes were collected at surgery and bisected; one half was subjected to biomarker mRNA analysis using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and the other half to routine histopathology. Lymph nodes from 174 CRC patients and 24 controls were analyzed. The median follow-up time was 59 (range 17-131) months. Cut-off levels were defined by analyzing quintiles by Cox regression model. CEA mRNA showed the best discriminating power between patients with recurrence in CRC after surgery and patients who were apparently disease-free (p = 0.015). The risk of recurrence for the CEA(+) patients was 4.6 times greater than for the CEA(-) patients (p < 0.0001). The other biomarkers gave lower hazard ratios. Cumulative survival analysis demonstrated that the average survival time was 99 months for CEA(-) patients compared to 39 months for CEA(+) patients, a difference of 60 months (p < 0.0001). Six to nine percent of the Stage I and Stage II patients [H&E(-)] had CEA(+), CK20(+), GCC(+) and/or MUC2(+) lymph nodes. Two of these patients died from recurrent CRC. Low lymph node MUC2/CEA mRNA ratio identified patients with high risk for recurrence (p = 0.011). Thus, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of CEA mRNA is a sensitive method to identify tumor cells in lymph nodes of CRC patients and, in combination with MUC2 mRNA, allows improved prediction of clinical outcome."
CD011134,0,21553105,0,Carbohydrate antigen 242 highly consists with carbohydrate antigen 19-9 in diagnosis and prognosis of colorectal cancer: study on 185 cases.,"The objective of the study was to compare the clinical value of preoperative serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and carbohydrate antigen 242 (CA242) in diagnosis and prognosis for 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Preoperative serum CA19-9 and CA242 concentrations were detected by C12 protein chip diagnostic system in 185 patients with CRC, and informative data were collected during 5-year follow-up periods. The value of CA19-9 and CA242 in diagnosis and prognosis for 5-year RFS as well as their consistencies and correlations were comparatively analyzed. The sensitivities of CA19-9 and CA242 were only 19.5 and 20%, respectively; the efficiencies of two TMs were 53.9 and 54.2%, respectively; and two TMs increased significantly with advancing clinical stages (P < 0.0001). Preoperative CA19-9 and CA242 levels correlated with stage (r, 0.411 and 0.408) and CEA concentration (r, 0.553 and 0.630). The concentrations of two TMs closely correlated with each other (r = 0.829), and two TMs had a very strong consistency in diagnosis (κ = 0.931). Among 88 of 185 cases with complete follow-up information on RFS, patients with positive preoperative serum CA19-9 or CA242 had higher 5-year recurrent rates (72.2% vs. 44.3%, P = 0.034; 76.5% vs. 43.7%, P = 0.015) and reduced median RFS (14 vs. 36 months, 12 vs. 36 months) compared with those with negative TMs. The consistency of predicting prognosis for RFS of two TMs was extremely strong (κ = 0.964). ROC curves analysis showed that CA242 test performed better than CA19-9 test (AUC, 0.648 vs. 0.605). Univariate analysis showed that preoperative serum status of both TMs was correlated with 5-year RFS (P < 0.05), whereas multivariate Cox regression model analysis revealed that none of them were independent prognostic factors for RFS. Both CA19-9 and CA242 had strong consistencies in diagnosis and prognosis for predicting 5-year RFS. CA242 demonstrated superior value to CA19-9 in CRC."

CD011134,0,22715592,0,Separation of circulating cancer cells by unique microfluidic chip in colorectal cancer.,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral blood are emerging as a useful tool for the detection of malignancy, monitoring disease progression, and measuring response to therapy. We describe a unique microfluidic chip that was capable of efficient and selective separation of CTCs from peripheral whole blood samples. The ability of microfluidic chip to capture CTCs from PBS and whole blood samples was tested. Sixty-eight peripheral blood samples from 68 colorectal cancer patients were investigated for the presence of CTCs by microchip technology. The frequency of CTCs was analyzed statistically for correlation with relevant clinical data. We also examined samples from 20 healthy individuals as controls. The calculated capture efficiency was 85.7% and decreased significantly at flow rates above 2.0 ml/h. The number of CTCs isolated ranged from 3 to 236/ml for colorectal patients [99 +/- 64 (mean +/- SD) CTCs/ml]. None of the 20 healthy subjects had any identifiable CTCs. We identified CTCs in 46 (67.65%) of the 68 patients: in two of nine (22.22%) Dukes A, in 10 of 24 (41.67%) Dukes B, in 21 of 22 (95.45%) Dukes C, and in all 13 Dukes D patients. The detection rate in Dukes C and D patients was much higher than in Dukes A and B patients (97.73% vs. 36.36%) (p < 0.01). A significant correlation between detection of CTCs and clinical stage (r = 0.792, p < 0.01) was found, which was higher than carcinoembryonic antigen (r = 0.285, p > 0.01), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (r = 0.258, p > 0.01), alpha-fetoprotein (r = 0.096, p > 0.01), and cancer antigen 125 (r = 0.134, p > 0.01). Microfluidic chip provides a novel method for capturing CTCs. The presence of CTCs correlated with clinical stage. It is important to evaluate CK-positive and DAPI-stained tumor cells together to determine the role of CTCs in tumor behavior and disease progression."

We report a case of 74-year-old man with a medical history of diabetes type II and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who underwent a right hemicolectomy for an adenocarcinoma of caecum in August 2004. In June 2007 the patient was diagnosed with high grade aortic valve stenosis as well as long segment stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch of left coronary artery. He was suggested aortic valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting but he refused the surgery. In October 2007 the patient underwent alpha 18FDG - PET scanning, due to increasing values of CEA serum level, which showed a 5 cm big isolated hypermetabolic lesion in the spleen. Due to operative risk, splenectomy was refused by surgeons. The patient underwent a chemotherapy with capecitabine in total of 8 cycles before his CEA level began to rise and MSCT showed a progression in size of splenic metastasis. The patients condition was reevaluated by a team of experts and splenectomy was performed in September 2008. In May 2009 during the postoperative follow up, MSCT scanning revealed enlarged lymph nodes in celiac region and hepatic lesion suspicious of metastasis and the patient was admitted for further chemotherapy treatment. There is still no standardized treatment for this condition due to small number of cases reported in literature. Splenectomy followed by chemotherapy seems to be an optimal treatment but still no final conclusions can be made."

CD011134,0,22128307,0,[Detection of multiple colon and rectal tumors during diagnostic treatment and follow-up].,"Recognition of the commonly encountered colorectal cancer (CRC) generally begins and takes place because of and based on symptoms and signs, due to the unsettled screening of this type of cancer. Sometimes, because of advanced stage cancer urgent surgical intervention could become necessary and, if this is the case, there is no time and possibility for searching for an eventual second tumor and perhaps the patient's status does not permit performing intraoperative investigations either. The incidence of multiple colon cancer is considered to be between 2.5 and 30% according to the literature. That is why one should exclude them even in the absence of pre- and intraoperative investigations and complaints. On the other hand, colonoscopy and perhaps irrigoscopy of seemingly healthy followed-up patients is mandatory. In the case of the presence of complaints/symptoms denoting impaired intestinal passage seen in a followed-up patient or during the adjuvant setting or metastatic/recurrent disease, treatment and even during hospice care we should evaluate the possibility of a second metachronous tumor. Moreover, if there is no urgency, the multidisciplinary team (oncoteam) should recommend the adequate treatment by balancing gain/utility and risk."
CD011134,0,22110233,0,Long-term vaccine therapy with autologous whole tumor cell-pulsed dendritic cells for a patient with recurrent rectal carcinoma.,"We performed continuous dendritic cells (DCs) vaccination to treat a patient with chemotherapy-resistant recurrent rectal carcinoma and lung and bone metastases. A patient has received a total of 66 DC vaccinations at 14-day intervals for 3 years until his death. Necrotic whole tumor cells (WTC) were selected as the tumor-associated antigen source because they showed a greater capacity for DC maturation and interleukin-12 secretion than both necrotic tumor lysate alone and necrotic tumor cell fragment alone. After the sixth vaccination, both skin test and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) response by peripheral blood T-cells to WTC-pulsed DCs were positive. Importantly, T-cell responses were positive towards DCs pulsed with several synthetic peptides including Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Melanoma associated antigen (MAGE)1 and MAGE3. A biopsy specimen collected from the pelvic bone metastasis after the 6th vaccination showed marked necrotic change of the carcinoma cells, with many infiltrating mononuclear cells. The patient did not show any particular adverse reactions to vaccination such as autoimmune phenomena. Our experience of this case suggests that continuous long-term vaccination with autologous WTC-pulsed DCs can elicit in vivo T-cell response against multiple tumor-associated antigens and induce tumor regression in disease that has proven resistant to intensive chemo- or radiation therapy."

CD011134,0,21901530,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and its receptor hnRNP M are mediators of metastasis and the inflammatory response in the liver.,"This article discusses the role of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a facilitator of the inflammatory response and its effect on colorectal cancer hepatic metastasis. Colorectal cancer accounts for 11% of all cancers in the United States and the majority of deaths are associated with liver metastasis. If left untreated, median survival is only six to 12 months. Resection of liver metastases offers the only chance for cure. Of the small number of patients who have operable cancer most will have further tumor recurrence. The molecular mechanisms associated with colorectal cancer metastasis to the liver are largely unknown. However CEA production has been shown both clinically and experimentally to be a factor in an increased metastatic potential of colorectal cancers to the liver. CEA also has a role in protecting tumor cells from the effects of anoikis and this affords a selective advantage for tumor cell survival in the circulation. CEA acts in the liver through its interaction with its receptor (CEAR), a protein that is related to the hnRNP M family of RNA binding proteins. In the liver CEA binds with hnRNP M on Kupffer cells and causes activation and production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-α. These cytokines affect the up-regulation of adhesion molecules on the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium and protect the tumor cells against cytotoxicity by nitric oxide (NO) and other reactive oxygen radicals. HnRNP M signaling in Kupffer cells appears to be controlled by beta-adrenergic receptor activation. The cells will respond to the β-adrenergic receptor agonist terbutaline resulting in reduced TNF-α and increased IL-10 and IL-6 production following CEA activation. This has implications for the control of tumor cell implantation and survival in the liver."

Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentrations, measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, were elevated in 26 (37.7%) of 69 patients with colorectal cancer and could not be detected among the 28 patients with benign intestinal conditions or 37 healthy individuals who comprised the control groups. Anti-CEA immuno globulin (Ig)G or IgM was detected by immunonephelometry in 44 (63.8%) patients with colorectal cancer, three (10.7%) with benign intestinal conditions and four (10.8%) healthy blood donors. Differences in antibody detection frequencies between the cancer patient group and the control groups were statistically significant. Titres of anti-CEA correlated significantly with CEA levels and Dukes' cancer stage. Antibody titre was an independent, significant, favourable predictor for 5-year recurrence-free survival. It is concluded that measurement of serum anti-CEA combined with CEA might be useful as a tumour marker and to assess prognosis.

CD011134,0,21645866,0,T3N0 rectal cancer: radiation for all?,"The optimal oncologic management for patients with T3N0 rectal cancer is currently controversial. Patients with pathologic T3N0 disease may have an ""intermediate"" risk of disease recurrence, suggesting that perhaps trimodality therapy may not be indicated for all patients. Adverse prognostic features, including a greater depth of perirectal fat invasion, poor tumor differentiation, the presence of lymphovascular invasion, abnormally elevated pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen levels (>5 ng/mL), circumferential margin involvement, and a low-lying position may identify T3N0 patients at high risk for local recurrence who may benefit from the addition of radiation therapy. However, recent randomized data suggest an improvement in local control and disease-free survival with preoperative radiation therapy compared with selective postoperative radiation therapy in all patient subgroups, arguing in favor of routine preoperative therapy. Additionally, rates of clinical understaging may exceed 20%, representing the percentage of patients who would require the delivery of postoperative radiotherapy with its associated sequelae. Future prospective randomized studies of T3N0 patients with upfront stratification by known prognostic factors and studies evaluating the molecular profile of rectal cancers hold the promise of better classifying patients at high risk of local and systemic recurrence, and thus, in need of adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy."

One of the reasons is the absence of tumor specific diagnostic and prognostic markers. The aim of this study was to examine the correlation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and -9 (MMP-9) expressions in serum and clinicopathological features of the colorectal adenocarcinoma. Another aim was to examine expression of MMP-9 in the tissue of the colorectal carcinoma in MMP-9 serum positive patients. In addition, we tried to establish the correlation between preoperative levels of serum markers (CEA and CA 19-9) and presence of MMP-2 or MMP-9. The study was performed on 32 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery and 11 patients in a control group who were operated for benign diseases. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine the molecular mass and SDS-PAGE zymography to determine levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Expression of MMP-9 was determined immunohistochemically in the tissue of the colorectal carcinoma of MMP-9 serum positive patients. MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were increased in the serum of the patients with colorectal cancer compared to the control group. There was significant correlation in MMPs levels among the patients with tumor stage I and II and the patients with tumor stage III and IV. Obtained results did not demonstrate correlation between levels of CEA, CA 19-9 and presence of MMP-2 or MMP-9. MMP-9 expression was positive in 85% of MMP-9 serum positive patients with colorectal carcinoma. The overexpression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 strongly suggests its association with colorectal adenocarcinoma. Detection of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in serum might be useful for identification of patients with higher risk for colorectal cancer recurrence."
CD011134,0,21540596,0,Complete radiological response of colorectal liver metastases after chemotherapy: what can we expect?,"Missing metastases, also called vanishing or disappearing liver metastases, concern about 5% of patients with colorectal liver metastasis undergoing chemotherapy, and this phenomenon is likely to become more frequent in the near future, with the widespread use of highly efficient chemotherapy. As their definition is highly dependent on the quality of initial imaging, a DLM on preoperative computed tomography scan should be systematically confirmed by a second imaging modality, ideally magnetic resonance imaging. It is important to note that a complete clinical response does not mean a complete pathologic response. Currently, there are no absolute criteria of a complete pathologic response. However, treatment with neoadjuvant and adjuvant hepatic arterial infusion in patients <60 years old with an initially low carcinoembryonic antigen level that normalizes under chemotherapy and who have no detectable lesion on both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is probably more likely to yield a complete pathologic response. Whatever their treatment, patients with DLM run a high risk of recurrence that could be decreased with the use of HAI. Despite a high recurrence rate, the overall 5-year survival rate of patients with DLM ranges from 40 to 80%. Having a DLM should no longer be a contraindication to hepatic surgery since long-term survival is expected in these highly chemosensitive patients. The use of adjuvant HAI in addition to efficient systemic chemotherapy could reduce the risk of hepatic relapse."

After cancer removal, detection of viable cancer cells could be useful to identify patients at risk for local recurrence. Thus, aim of the study was the detection of residual peritoneal cancer cells with a possible prognostic role for local recurrence. Twenty-nine patients were operated (R0) for low (extraperitoneal) rectal cancer, without neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. Before and immediately after cancer removal, a peritoneal lavage was done to evaluate by RT-PCR the cytokeratin 20 mRNA on isolated cells and in order to detect cancer cells by the Thin-prep test. After a median follow-up of 39 months, 5 patients died (17%), one for non-cancer-related disease, two (7%) for local recurrence and peritoneal carcinosis, and two for distant metastases. Preoperative cytology with Thin-prep test was positive in 4 patients (14%), while postoperative peritoneal cytology was positive only in 1 patient, different from the previous. No patient developed local or distal recurrence and all were disease-free at the end of the follow-up. RT-PCR analysis was positive on the peritoneal lavage after cancer removal in 11 patients. One died for unrelated cause and no one developed local recurrences. Local recurrence occurred in only 1 of the 2 patients with positive RT-PCR analysis on the first lavage and negative on the second lavage.

However, these tools only have a moderate ability to predict the development of liver metastases. Novel methods, including the detection of circulating tumor cells and carcinoembryonic antigens in serum, have been developed, and their prognostic and predictive characteristics have been assessed. In addition, several molecular and genetic markers in the primary tumor have been studied. Unfortunately, these studies are often small and their results have been mixed, yielding no consistent sets of externally validated predictors of colorectal liver metastases.

CEA is a protein used as a biomarker for several cancers; particularly, to monitor response to treatment in colon and rectal cancer patients. The nanocomposites can be easily separated and firmly attached to an electrode owing to their excellent magnetic properties. This represents a promising advantage for bioassay applications. More importantly, the nanostructures exhibit intense and stable ECL emissions in neutral solution, which makes them ideal for ECL immunosensing. The 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS) polyelectrolyte shell on the nanostructure surface not only enhances the intensity and stability of the ECL signal, but also acts as a crosslinker for immunosensor fabrication. A CEA antibody immobilized onto a nanocomposite/APS/electrode with gold nanoparticles comprises the ECL immunosensor. The principle of ECL detection for CEA is based on a change in steric hindrance after immunoreaction, which leads to a decrease in ECL intensity. A wide detection range (0.064 pg  ml(-1)-10 ng  ml(-1)) and low detection limit (0.032 pg  ml(-1)) are achieved. The immunosensor is highly sensitive and selective, and exhibits excellent stability and good reproducibility. It thus has great potential for clinical protein detection. In particular, this approach uses a novel class of bifunctional nanocomposites that display both intense ECL and excellent magnetism, which renders them suitable for a large range of bioassay applications."

CD011134,0,21568065,0,[Surveillance of patients after colonoscopic polypectomy and curative resection of colorectal cancer].,"The position paper of the GastrointestinaL Oncology Section of the Israeli Gastroenterological Association recommends specific guidelines for surveillance after polypectomy and curative resection of colorectal cancer. Periodic colonoscopy is necessary for early detection of metachronous lesions or cancer recurrence. After polypectomy of a simple hyperplasic polyp, colonoscopy is repeated in 10 years. Small adenoma dictates colonoscopy after 5-10 years. In the case of advanced adenoma, repeat coLonoscopy is to be conducted after 3 years. The personal impression of the colonoscopists may advance procedures to an earlier colonoscopy, especially after piecemeal polypectomy of a large sessile polyp. Fecal occult blood test or any other screening procedures are not needed after polypectomy. Colonoscopy, carcinoembrionic antigen examination (CEA) and liver imaging are necessary for surveillance after curative resection of colorectal cancer, and improve survival. Total colonoscopy should be performed before the operation or in cases with obstructive carcinoma, colonic imaging should be completed with virtual colonoscopy. Total colonoscopy should be performed 3-6 months after surgery if not conducted previously. The next follow-up is needed 3 and 5 years after the operation. After low anterior resection, the recurrence rate may be high and patients who have not undergone radiation therapy nor mesorectal resection should undergo sigmoidoscopy every 3-6 months for 2-3 years after surgery."

We present the case of a 69-year-old man with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and bone metastases treated with metronomic chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide based). He had had a colon adenocarcinoma ten years before. The atypical features of this case were an unusually long-lasting response to metronomic chemotherapy and an increase in serum levels of some non-prostate-specific tumor markers (CEA and CA 19-9) that was not related to a relapse of colon cancer.

The value of following serial CEA levels in patients who initially present with less than or normal levels of CEA (nonsecretors) is controversial. This study sought to determine the use of follow-up CEA levels in nonsecretors. A retrospective review was performed of patients with resected Stage I, II, and III CRC. We excluded patients who did not have a pretreatment CEA level, at least two follow-up CEA levels, or in whom CEA levels did not normalize after resection. The patients were grouped by initial CEA values: CEA 5 ng/mL or less (nonsecretors) and CEA 5 + ng/mL: (secretors). We identified 186 patients with CRC; 146 were initial nonsecretors. We identified 22 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer; 6 were secretors and 16 patients were nonsecretors. In the secretors group, CEA was elevated with recurrence in four (66%) of the patients. In the nonsecretors, CEA was elevated with recurrence in eight (50%) of the patients. In summary, many recurrences of CRC are marked by an elevation of CEA regardless of whether the patients initially presented as secretors or nonsecretors."

CD011134,0,20919526,0,Management of disappearing colorectal hepatic metastases.,"Disappearance of liver lesions during neoadjuvant chemotherapy is common and is the basis for the increasing number of patients suitable for potentially curative hepatectomy in patients with hepatic colorectal metastases. Many of the liver lesions disappearing on radiologic evaluation after successful chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer are still present and alive. In patients with only some disappearing lesions, exploration should be undertaken to thoroughly evaluate all sites of previous disease. Because many small residual lesions are scars and complete pathologic responses, treatment should include not only complete treatment of all remaining lesions but also parenchymal conservation techniques such as ablations and limited resections. For patients with completely disappearing lesions, the standard therapy is still exploration and direct intraoperative assessment. However, if the patient chooses observation in the setting of negative CEA, MRI, and PET, close follow-up should be undertaken to avoid missing treatable and resectable recurrences."
CD011134,0,20816019,0,Dendritic cell vaccination of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer is with more than 4000 new cases every year the third most common cancer in Denmark. Metastases are most often found in the liver, and 20-25% of the patients have synchronous metastases to the liver at time of primary diagnosis. Other frequent sites for metastases are lungs and lymph nodes. Without treatment the median survival for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is 7-9 months. Patients receiving systemic or regional chemotherapy now have a median survival of approximately 20 months. Up to 40% of the patients undergoing intended curative surgery subsequently relapse with local or distant disease, and approximately 80% of the relapses appear within the first 3 years. If the cancer metastasises, and the chances of radical surgery are eliminated, the prognosis is poor. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and immunological effects of treating patients with disseminated colorectal cancer with a dendritic cell based cancer vaccine (MelCancerVac). The vaccine consisted of dendritic cells generated from autologous mononuclear cells pulsed with an allogeneic tumor cell lysate, selected for its high expression of cancer associated antigens. A clinical phase I study evaluating tolerability and toxicity of the treatment was established. Six patients with progressive disease were included and the analysis revealed that the treatment was well tolerated and not associated with toxicity. A subsequent clinical phase II study evaluating the activity of the treatment with CT-scan based measurements of tumors (RECIST), self reported quality of life (SF-36), and clinical evaluation was established. Out of twenty included patients with progressive disease, seventeen received intervention with the vaccine. Stable disease was achieved in four patients and two of these remained stable throughout the entire study period. Quality of life remained for most parameters included in the evaluation high and stable. The immunological consequences of the treatment were evaluated with plasma- and serum-levels of inflammatory and non-inflammatory markers (the following 10 cytokines: GM-CSF, INF-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha, and in addition the inflammatory chemokines MIP-1beta, Eotaxin and IP-10) and biomarkers CEA and TIMP-1. These analyses showed that the vaccine induced increasing levels of Th1 cytokines such as GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-2 in patients achieving stable disease. Patients with progressive disease had increasing levels of CEA and TIMP-1, while patients achieving stable disease maintained relatively stable levels. Conclusively, treatment with this dendritic cell based cancer vaccine was non-toxic and safe, clinical response in terms of stable disease was achieved in 24% of the patients, and the patients maintained a high quality of life during treatment. The immunological analyses indicated that the treatment resulted in favourable anticancer responses in the patients' immune system in terms of polarisation towards a Th1 dominated response potentially directed against tumor cells. Since no partial or complete responses were observed and since the number of patients was relatively low these results have to be interpreted with caution. Moreover, phase II study designs do not lead to final conclusions regarding clinical efficacy, which must be validated in larger prospective, randomised and controlled studies."

Immunohistochemistry coloration is based on the antigen-antibody affinity, the antibody binding situs being identified either by antibody coloration direct methods or by using an indirect method where the marking is supplied by antibodies called secondary or even tertiary. The present study is based on the immunohistochemical investigation of some molecular markers with a prognosis value in colorectal cancers (CCR), like the antibody p53 immune expression and of some factors supposed to have prognosis value, such as CA19-9 (carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen or Lewis antigen). In the last decade, the studies have tried to define the prognosis of the molecular markers that allow the identification of the patients with recurrent risk after surgical treatment and who can benefit from chemotherapy in an efficient way. The purpose of the study on immunohistochemical markers is to aim towards the treatment based on molecular phenotypes of colorectal tumors. In 2000, according to the Consensus Conference of the Colorectal Working Group of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Prognostic Factors (AJC), there were established four categories of prognosis factors in colorectal cancers based on the practical importance and the number of studies referring to them.

CD011134,0,20162425,1,Lead time of carcinoembryonic antigen elevation in the postoperative follow-up of colorectal cancer did not affect the survival rate after recurrence.,The role of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the early detection of recurrence during the postoperative follow-up of colorectal cancer remains unclear. We hypothesize that the tumor with longer lead time of CEA elevation to the definite recurrence may have a better prognosis because of its slower growth rate and closer observation.
CD011134,0,20154498,0,[A case of complete response after treatment with UFT and leucovorin for synchronous multiple liver metastases of rectal cancer].,"The patient was a 55-year-old female who had multiple liver metastases of rectal cancer. This patient underwent hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy after low anterior resection for rectal cancer. Hepatic arterial infusion was discontinued due to severe diarrhea, and the administration of UFT (300 mg/day) and LV(75 mg/day) was then begun. The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was normalized immediately after the start of this administration. One year later, liver metastases disappeared on computed tomography (CT) and a complete response (CR) was achieved. No adverse events were noted, and CR was maintained for 2 years. This therapy can serve as one of the chemotherapies for advanced colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,20150437,0,Serum cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein is a potential prognostic marker for metastatic colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer has high rates of recurrence and metastasis. Many patients with similar histopathological features show significantly different clinical outcomes, and these differences are primarily related to metastases undetected by current diagnostic methods. There is no useful serological marker for metastatic disease. We investigated the cellular apoptosis susceptibility (CSE1L/CAS) protein in comparison with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a marker for metastatic colorectal cancer. Using serum from 103 patients with stage I, II, III, and IV disease, CSE1L was detected in 36.0% (9 of 25), 57.7% (15 of 26), 71.4% (30 of 42), and 88.9% (8 of 9) of patients, respectively; a pathological CEA level was found in 16.0% (4 of 25), 42.3% (11 of 26), 47.6% (20 of 42), and 77.8% (7 of 9) of patients, respectively; a combined CSE1L/CEA assay was detected in 48.0% (12 of 25), 65.4% (17 of 26), 88.1% (37 of 42), and 100% (9 of 9) of patients, respectively. Lymphatic metastasis is an important predictor of poor prognosis and crucial for determination of therapeutic strategy. Serum CSE1L was detected in 74.5% (38 of 51) of patients with lymph node metastasis, whereas a pathological CEA level was found in only 52.9% (27 of 51) of the same patients (P < 0.001); the combined CSE1L/CEA assay increased sensitivity to 90.2% (46 of 51). Animal experiments showed CSE1L reduction in B16-F10 melanoma cells correlated with decreased metastasis to the colorectal tract in C57BL/6 mice. These results indicate that assay of serum CSE1L may facilitate diagnosis of colorectal cancer lymphatic metastases; furthermore, CSE1L is a possible therapeutic target."

CD011134,0,20112971,0,Amperometric immunosensor for carcinoembryonic antigen in colon cancer samples based on monolayers of dendritic bipodal scaffolds.,"Detection of proteins that signal the presence or recurrence of cancer is a powerful therapeutic tool for effective early diagnosis and treatment. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has been extensively studied as a tumor marker in clinical diagnosis. We report on the development of an amperometric biosensor for the detection of CEA based on the immobilization of anti-CEA monoclonal antibody on a novel class of bipodal thiolated self-assembled monolayers containing reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester end groups. The current variations showed a linear relationship with the concentration of CEA over the range of 0-200 ng/mL with a sensitivity of 3.8 nA x mL x ng(-1) and a detection limit of 0.2 ng/mL, which is well below the commonly accepted concentration threshold (5 ng/mL) used in clinical diagnosis. Real time and accelerated stability studies of the reporter antibody under various storage conditions demonstrated that the enzymatic activity and antibody affinity of the conjugate is retained for long periods of time in commercial stabilizing buffers such as StabilGuard Biomolecule Stabilizer, and a prediction of the stability trends was carried out using the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters obtained from the Arrhenius equation. The developed immunosensor as well as a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit were successfully applied to the detection of CEA in serum samples obtained from colon cancer patients, and an excellent correlation of the levels of CEA measured was obtained. Ongoing work is looking at the incorporation of the developed biosensor into a platform for multiplexed simultaneous detection of several breast cancer related biomarkers."
CD011134,0,20110784,0,Colorectal cancer: response to sunitinib in a heavily pretreated colorectal cancer patient.,"A 64-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room in May 2000 due to pelvic pain, functional disability of the lower limb, and bleeding from a rectal fistula. The patient was diagnosed with a rectum-sigma adenocarcinoma (pT1N0M0 stage). After surgery by left hemicolectomy, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with tegafur for 6 months. Due to the development of subsequent recurrences (infravesical relapse, bone and lung progression) associated with CEA progression and pain worsening, the patient received treatment by every available agent for the metastatic colorectal cancer, including oxaliplatin and radiotherapy; irinotecan; FOLFOX schema; oral capecitabine; raltitrexed; irinotecan and cetuximab; cetuximab as a single agent; always in combination with zolendronic acid-based treatment for pain control. Once the patient had progressed to all the approved drugs available in the market, sunitinib (50mg/day given for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest) was proposed as compassionate use. The patient received sunitinib for a total of 6 months (four cycles). On account of the nonmeasurable disease nature of the metastatic presentation in the present case, the clinical benefit was measured in terms of reduction of painkiller intake, improvement in performance status of the patient, and CEA serum levels. In addition to all of these clinical and biological data, CT images showed an increase in necrotic area of the bone lesion without any decrease in tumor size by classical RECIST criteria. The patient is still under sunitinib treatment and has recovered his normal daily activity."

The tumor was a well differentiated adenocarcinoma, type 2 in the Japanese classification of colorectal carcinoma. The tumor was considered to be in stage II (ss, ly2, v0, n (-), P0, H0, M (-)). He did not receive any adjuvant chemotherapy. After 2 years and 3 months from the surgery, an abdominal MRI and an abdominal CT scan revealed a 30 mm hepatic nodule lesion. We diagnosed with liver metastasis of the cecum cancer. The patient refused both surgery and radio-frequency ablation therapy. We chose radiotherapy for liver metastasis. He was given a total dose of 50 Gy/25 fractions. After 3 months from the radiotherapy, the tumor was reduced gradually and tumor marker (CEA) was normalized. The disease was diagnosed as CR because no tumors were detected. There has been no liver recurrence. But after 4 years and 6 months from the surgery, 20 mm lung nodules in rt-lower lung were revealed by chest X-ray. Once more, we chose radiotherapy for lung tumor. He was given a total dose of 66 Gy/33 fractions. At present, the tumor was reduced gradually. There has been no recurrence since his irradiation. If the case was made a good choice, radiation therapy appears to be effective for liver and lung tumors from the colorectal cancer."

CD011134,0,19942831,0,Surveillance approaches among colorectal cancer survivors after curative-intent.,"Intensive surveillance among colorectal cancer patients receiving curative-intent, particularly during the first 2 to 3 years of follow-up, has a beneficial impact upon all-cause survival at five years. Intensive surveillance appears to be associated with the early detection of recurrences, and more often accompanied by a clinical presentation enabling surgical resection. The optimal combination and frequency of surveillance tests is unknown. Imaging of the chest and abdomen have increasingly been recommended by professional organizations, in addition to CEA levels, in order to detect resectable recurrences. Metachronous cancers are relatively uncommon, nonetheless, surveillance colonoscopy is typically recommended. Cau-tion is warranted in further advancing the intensity of surveillance, as increasingly aggressive surveillance programs risk increased detection of pseudodisease. Different types of information will enhance our understanding of the impact of follow-up programs, including data regarding quality of life, cost, and patient preferences."

She had a previous history of colectomy with a diagnosis of ascending colonic cancer 8 years later. Pathological examination was a moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma with lymph node metastasis (Stage IIIa). PET scan demonstrated hot spots of para-aortic and left supra-clavicular lesions. The serum CEA and CA19-9 levels regained the normal value. No malignancy was recognized by endoscopic examinations of upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. We supported that swelling of lymph nodes were due to lymphoma. Laparotomic biopsy of para-aortic lymph node was done after 6 months. Histologically metastatic adenocarcinoma was recognized. We performed systemic chemotherapy of UFT and LV on recurrent colonic cancer. After 9 courses, spots of para-aortic and left supra-clavicular lesions disappeared on the PET scan.

CD011134,0,19827341,0,Diagnosis and management of local and locoregional recurrence of colorectal carcinoma.,"All intraabdominal forms of recurrence of colorectal carcinoma, other than metastases in the liver, are considered a locoregional treatment failure. Maximum frequency of local recurrence of CRC occurs in the first two years following the initial potentially curative resection. Intensive follow-up in this period is therefore reasonable. It should be based on case history, clinical examination and examination of tumor markers (particularly CEA). Other examinations are indicated only for patients with abnormal findings or during normal annual check-ups. The salvage surgery for CRC recurrence covers a large scale of surgical performances from limited local resections up to extensive surgery including pelvic exenteration and peritonectomy. The potentially curative resection (R0 and R1) of colorectal carcinoma is a sole confirmed factor that has a direct positive influence on the overall survival of patients (Fig. 5, Ref. 21)."

Consecutive chemotherapy-naive MCRC patients treated with either standard chemotherapy-alone (FOLFIRI/FOLFOX) or chemotherapy+bevacizumab (FOLFIRI+bevacizumab) were included in the analysis. Patients had to have serial biweekly measurement of CEA and CA19.9 available for at least three months of treatment. Primary study endpoint was Progression Free Survival (PFS). Biomarker levels and type of treatment as well as major demographic and clinical factors were analyzed for their impact on PFS. Out of 243 evaluated MCRC patients, 87 had biomarkers available as per inclusion criteria. Among all evaluated factors only type of treatment (chemotherapy-alone vs chemotherapy+bevacizumab) and baseline CA19.9 (> vs < normal) were independently associated with PFS, whilst neither baseline CEA nor biomarker reduction during therapy reached statistical significance. When patients with different baseline CA19.9 levels were analysed separately, only patients with abnormal CA19.9 benefited significantly from the administration of bevacizumab.The current study demonstrated a significant predictive value of CA19.9, but not of CEA and biomarker reduction, for MCRC patients treated with new antineoplastic drugs.

CD011134,0,19635733,0,Pulmonary resection for metastases from colorectal carcinoma.,"A pulmonary resection of metastatic colorectal carcinoma is an accepted method of treatment. The purpose of this study was to confirm the role of resections for pulmonary metastases from colorectal carcinoma, and to determine the clinical course, outcome, and prognostic factors after surgery. A retrospective analysis was conducted of the records of all patients with pulmonary metastases from colorectal carcinoma who underwent a surgical resection between 1995 and 2008, at a single surgical center. The overall 5-year survival rate was 74%. Multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that the number of pulmonary metastases (HR: 9.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-82.2, P=0.0428) and prethoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (HR: 9.79, 95% CI: 1.11-86.8, P=0.0404) were statistically significant predictors of survival after the first pulmonary metastasectomy. In addition, a second resection for recurrent metastases was performed in eight patients, and a third resection was done in one patient.

CD011134,0,19581858,0,The role of carcinoembriogenic antigen in predicting response and survival to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for distal rectal cancer.,"Carcinoembriogenic antigen (CEA) is the most frequently used tumor marker in rectal cancer. A decrease in carcinoembriogenic antigen after radical surgery is associated with survival in these patients. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy may lead to significant primary tumor downstaging, including complete tumor regression in selected patients. Therefore, we hypothesized that a decrease in CEA after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy could reflect tumor response to chemoradiotherapy, affecting final disease stage and ultimately survival."

CD011134,0,19446404,0,Factors influencing histological response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy for rectal carcinoma.,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy is one of the standard therapeutic regimens for rectal carcinoma. Nevertheless, chemoradiation therapy is not completely devoid of adverse effects, and it would be interesting to try to predict which patient will respond to neoadjuvancy. This study aimed at analyzing factors influencing pathological response after therapy. We reviewed the clinical and morphological data of 39 patients after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. We performed immunohistochemistry for p53, cyclin D1, MIB-1 (Ki67), and bcl-2 protein in paraffin-embedded tissue. In our series, 12 patients did not respond to neoadjuvant therapy, 12 showed a complete response, and 15 a partial response. There was a statistically significant association between response and cardiomyopathy (p=0.02) and tenesmus (p=0.02) and a trend towards significance for age (p=0.08), preoperative TNM (p=0.08), peritumoral inflammatory response (p=0.07), and preoperative CEA (p=0.08). As for immunohistochemistry, we only found a trend towards significance for cyclin D1 (p=0.08).

Colonoscopic examination revealed a 7-mm 0-Is type polyp in the sigmoid colon. Endoscopic mucosal resection for this lesion completely removed the lesion and the histologic diagnosis was well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Cancer cells invaded the submucosa to a depth of 900 microm, and vascular invasion was found. Therefore, the patient underwent additional surgical resection with lymph node dissection. During follow-up, however, serum CEA increased beyond the normal limit 18 months after surgical operation, and a 15-mm single liver metastasis was found through enhanced CT scan abdominal imaging, the FDG-PET scan, and ultrasonography. We have to pay attention to metachronous liver metastasis especially when the vascular invasion is suspected in the resected sample, even if the lesion is completely removed."

CD011134,0,19384300,0,High expression of tumour-associated trypsin inhibitor correlates with liver metastasis and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer.,"Increased expression of tumour-associated trypsin inhibitor (TATI) in tumour tissue and/or serum has been associated with poor survival in various cancer forms. Moreover, a proinvasive function of TATI has been shown in colon cancer cell lines. In this study, we have examined the prognostic significance of tumour-specific TATI expression in colorectal cancer, assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarrays (TMAs) with tumour specimens from two independent patient cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were used to estimate time to recurrence, disease-free survival and overall survival. In both cohorts, a high (>50% of tumour cells) TATI expression was an independent predictor of a significantly shorter overall survival. In cohort II, in multivariate analysis including age, gender, disease stage, differentiation grade, vascular invasion and carcinoembryonal antigen (CEA), high TATI expression was associated with a significantly decreased overall survival (HR=1.82; 95% CI=1.19-2.79) and disease-free survival (HR=1.56; 95% CI=1.05-2.32) in curatively treated patients. Moreover, there was an increased risk for liver metastasis in both cohorts that remained significant in multivariate analysis in cohort II (HR=2.85; 95% CI=1.43-5.66). In conclusion, high TATI expression is associated with liver metastasis and is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer."

A 69-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for a clinical survey. She had been operated on for bilateral ovarian cancer in 1987 and was treated by postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. The patient's follow-up showed no abnormality until 2006. Colonoscopy revealed an elevated irregular lesion in the cecum. A biopsy of the lesion showed a group V, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. A right hemicolectomy with a partial resection of the ileum and a lymphadenectomy was performed. Immunohistochemical staining during the pathological diagnosis showed the lesion to be colon metastasis from a serous papillary adenocarcinoma of the ovary. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for cytokeratin 7, carbohydrate antigen (CA)-125, and estrogen receptors, and negative for cytokeratin 20, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA19-9.

CD011134,0,19187105,0,Localized eosinophilic (Langerhans' cell) granuloma of the lower lip. A lesion that may cause diagnostic error.,"Eosinophilic (Langerhans' cell) granuloma is most common in children and is unusual in the elderly. A cutaneous lesion as the sole manifestation of adult Langerhans' cell histiocytosis is rare. We report an 81-year-old man who presented with a noduloulcerative lesion on the lower lip. A punch biopsy suggested a lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma. In the absence of immunohistochemistry, the large pale cells with atypical lobular nuclei and patent nucleoli, with an overlying ulceration, were interpreted as carcinoma cells. Definitive diagnosis was established after complete resection of the lesion aided with the use of immunohistochemistry. The proliferating cells were S100, CD1a and CD207 (langerin) positive and cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, CD15, CD30, melan A and carcinoembryonic antigen negative. To our knowledge, eosinophilic (Langerhans' cell) granuloma of the lip has not been described. The case constituted a diagnostic challenge because of its unusual clinical presentation and its histopathological similarity to certain other benign and malignant entities. Because there was no other organ involved, the patient was treated with complete surgical excision without recurrence or other organ involvement in the 4-month follow-up period.

The objective of this retrospective multi-institutional study was to assess the influence of chemotherapy administered before and after hepatic resection on long-term outcomes among patients with initially resectable SCRLM treated from 1995 to 2005. Clinicopathologic data, treatments, and long-term outcomes from patients with initially resectable SCRLM who underwent partial hepatectomy at three hepatobiliary centers were reviewed. Four hundred ninety-nine consecutive patients underwent resection; 297 (59.5%) and 264 (52.9%) were treated with chemotherapy before and after resection. Chemotherapy strategies included pre-hepatectomy alone (n = 148, 24.7%), post-hepatectomy alone (n = 115, 23.0%), perioperative (n = 149, 29.0%), and no chemotherapy (n = 87, 17.4%). Male gender (p = 0.0029, HR = 1.41 [1.12-1.77]), node-positive primary tumor (p = 0.0046, HR = 1.40 [1.11-1.77]), four or more SCRLM (p = 0.0005, HR = 1.65 [1.24-2.18]), and post-hepatectomy chemotherapy treatment for 6 months or longer (p = 0.039, HR = 0.75 [0.57-0.99]) were associated with recurrence-free survival after discovery of SCRLM. Carcinoembryonic antigen >200 ng/ml (p = 0.0003, HR = 2.33 [1.48-3.69]), extrahepatic metastatic disease (p = 0.0025, HR = 2.34 [1.35-4.05]), four or more SCRLM (p = 0.033, HR = 1.43 [1.03-2.00]), and post-hepatectomy chemotherapy treatment for 2 months or longer (p < 0.0001, HR = 0.59 [0.45-0.76]) were associated with overall survival. Pre-hepatectomy chemotherapy was not associated with recurrence-free or overall survival. Patients treated with perioperative chemotherapy had similar outcomes as patients treated with post-hepatectomy chemotherapy only. We conclude that chemotherapy administered after but not before resection of SCRLM was associated with improved recurrence-free and overall survival. However, prospective randomized trials are needed to determine the optimal timing of chemotherapy."

CD011134,0,18672360,0,Evolving molecular classification by genomic and proteomic biomarkers in colorectal cancer: potential implications for the surgical oncologist.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent cancers in the Western world and represents a major health burden. CRC development is a multi-step process that spans 10-15years, thereby providing an opportunity for early detection and even prevention. As almost half of all patients undergoing surgery develop recurrent disease, surveillance is advocated, albeit with various means and intervals. Current screening and surveillance efforts have so far only had limited impact due to suboptimal compliance. Currently, CEA is the only biomarker in clinical use for CRC, but has suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. New and better biomarkers are therefore strongly needed. Non-invasive biomarkers may develop through the understanding of colorectal carcinogenesis. Three main pathways occur in CRC, including chromosomal instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI) and epigenetic silencing through the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP). These pathways have distinct clinical, pathological, and genetic characteristics, which can be used for molecular classification and comprehensive tumour profiling for improved diagnostics, prognosis and treatment in CRC. Molecular-biological research has advanced with the sequencing of the human genome and the availability of genomic and proteomic high-throughput technologies using different chip platforms, such as tissue microarrays, DNA microarrays, and mass spectrometry. This review aims to give an overview of the evolving biomarker concepts in CRC, with concerns on methods, and potential for clinical implications for the surgical oncologist."

A lateral segmentectomy was performed for a solitary hepatic tumor. Histopathological examination of the tumor indicated well differentiated adenocarcinoma compatible with the metastasis from the previous descending colon cancer. There have been no signs of recurrence for 5 years after the hepatic resection. This case suggests that distant metastasis from colorectal could be found several years after operation like in this case, and consequently long-term and strict follow-up is required after curative resection of the primary lesion."

The clinical response to such treatment is generally assessed by tumor measurement through imaging. This study was performed to evaluate the correlation between serial changes in imaging results and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. In 64 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving cetuximab plus FOLFIRI or FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy we retrospectively analyzed the relationship between changes in serum CEA and changes in imaging results throughout the treatment course. Response in terms of serum CEA change was defined as a >/=50% drop in CEA level for more than 4 weeks. The sensitivity and specificity of serum CEA changes after targeted chemotherapy in relation to imaging results were 80.5% (33/41) and 73.9% (17/23), respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 78.1% (50/64). The progression-free survival time of responders assessed by serum CEA change was significantly longer than that of nonresponders (p=0.0091).

The tumor was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, type 2 in the Japanese classification of colorectal carcinoma. The tumor was considered to be in stage I (mp, n (-), P0, H0, M (-)). He did not receive any adjuvant chemotherapy. After 6 months from the surgery, ultra sound sonography and an abdominal CT scan revealed a 30 mm hepatic nodule lesion. We diagnosed liver metastasis of the rectal cancer. The patient refused a surgery and chemotherapy. We chose radiotherapy for liver metastasis. He was given a total dose of 60 Gy/10 fractions/10 days with 3D-CRT. After 1 month from the radiotherapy, the tumor was reduced to 17 mm in size and regressed gradually. At 19 months from the radio therapy, the disease was diagnosed as CR because no tumors were detected.

CD011134,0,19102333,0,Telomerase activity of blood samples and recurrence of colorectal cancer.,"Recurrence, which occurs in about 20-30% of colorectal cancer patients after curative surgical treatment, is an important factor in determining prognosis. Therefore, early detection and prediction of recurrence is an important issue in the treatment of the disease. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that synthesizes telomere DNA, thereby compensating for telomere loss that occurs with each replication cycle, and limits proliferation cells. Telomerase is expressed in the majority of primary human tumors and hTERT is considered one of the most important proteins affecting telomerase activity. We evaluated telomerase activity in mesenteric and peripheral blood samples in addition to hTERT expression in cancerous tissues by means of immunohistochemistry in 120 patients who underwent curative surgical treatment at our department."

Pathological examination of omental dissemination demonstrated moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma. FOLFOX4 therapy was started on April, 2006. Primary lesion decrease and release from bowel obstruction after 4 cycles was judged as a partial response. The partial response continued, and the serum CEA decreased 18.5 ng/mL after completion of 16 cycles, but grade 3 neuropathy occurred. We started S-1 as second-line chemotherapy in May, 2007. There was primary lesion re-growth after 4 cycles, so we changed to S-1+CPT-11 therapy. The adverse events were grade 3 neuropathy and leucopenia throughout the course. Chemotherapy is now continued on an outpatient basis, 24 months after the medical treatment started. FOLFOX4 therapy is useful for patients with advanced colon cancer accompanied by peritoneal dissemination."

We report a case of colorectal carcinoma that presented with gastrointestinal symptoms 14 months after completion of treatment. Investigations showed rise in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Suspecting disease recurrence, complete radioimaging workup was performed; the only abnormality detected was a smooth, hypodense area in the posterior third of the spleen on contrast-enhanced computed tomography abdomen. In view of the previous diagnosis of carcinoma colon, the symptoms reported by the patient, the elevated CEA, and the atypical CECT appearance, a diagnosis of splenic metastasis was made.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is good for diagnosis of such an extraluminal lesion. A 51-year-old Asian female was diagnosed with uT3N0M0 rectal adenocarcinoma 31 months ago. She had undergone chemotherapy, radiotherapy and abdominoperineal resection (APR). Eight months ago, colonoscopy and computed tomography (CT) were unremarkable. Carcinoembryonic antigen was 1.1 ng/ml. Pelvic examination revealed a 3 x 2 cm firm soft-tissue mass palpable through the left vaginal wall. EUS revealed a mass in the left lateral vaginal wall measuring up to 21 x 27 mm in cross section without invasion of adjacent pelvic structures. Transvaginal EUS-FNA was performed with a 22-gauge needle. Final cytology confirmed recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma. Subsequent surgery also confirmed a 2.3 cm grade II adenocarcinoma.

CD011134,0,18638656,0,Pre- and postoperative levels in serum of mannan-binding lectin associated serine protease-2 -a prognostic marker in colorectal cancer.,"Mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) is the initiating enzyme of the lectin pathway of complement activation. High preoperative serum levels of MASP-2 are associated with recurrence and poor survival in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study we investigate the prognostic role of MASP-2 in patients curatively resected for primary CRC. Serum concentrations of MASP-2 were determined in 281 patients prior to surgery and 7 months postoperatively using a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay. End points were recurrent cancer and death within a median follow-up time of 7.9 years. The correlation between pre- and postoperative levels was 0.49. High postoperative levels of MASP-2 were significantly associated with poor survival [p = 0.04; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.35; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.80] and recurrence (p = 0.01, HR = 1.6, 95% CI, 1.1-1.6). The inclusion of age, gender, tumor localization, and Dukes stage in multivariate analysis demonstrated that high MASP-2 levels were independently predictive of survival (p = 0.01; HR = 1.5, 95% CI, 1.1-2.0) and recurrence (p = 0.01, HR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4). Combining pre- and postoperative MASP-2 levels did not improve the prediction of survival/recurrence. High postoperative levels of MASP-2 are associated with poor prognosis in patients curatively resected for CRC. A change of the MASP-2 level from preoperative levels was not, per se, predictive of recurrent disease or survival."

It is difficult to introduce cancer chemotherapy to hemodialysis patients, and limited chemotherapeutics are available. The case was a 57-year-old man who was undergoing continuous hemodialysis when rectal cancer was found with multiple hepatic metastases. After rectum elevation and anterior resection, we treated him with 5-FU/LV therapy. After three courses the number of hepatic metastatic foci decreased, and the ascites disappeared. Levels of carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA)decreased from 837 ng/mL to 29 ng/mL; carbohydrate antigen 19-9(CA19-9)decreased from 79.6 U/mL to 14.2 U/mL, and cancer-related antigen 72-4 (CA72-4)was reduced from 33.3 U/mL to 7.4 U/mL.

UFT-E granules were administered orally daily at 400 mg/body/day following surgery. He developed perineal pain and perineal discharges following an increase the CEA level in April 2006. PET revealed a tumor in the perineum and multiple lung metastases. Chemotherapy with mFOLFOX 6 for 8 courses and FOLFIRI 2 for 4 courses were administered since July in 2006. Although CT revealed a the reduction in multiple lung metastases, CEA was increased to over a maximum 109, high fever continued and the pinealtumor was enlarged in December 2006. The patient underwent resection of the perinealmass, but he developed perinealsevere pain and perinealdischarge. So radiotherapy of the pelvic region was given at a total dose of 40 Gy(given 2 Gy each fragment)followed by administration of FOLFIRI 2 for 12 courses. After chemoradiotherapy, the CEA level was remarkably decreased. PET could not detect any mass in lung fields and revealed a little accumulation in the pelvic region. Chemotherapy with FOLFIRI 2 is administered monthly now, and the CEA level has been within the normal range since July of 2007. The pineal pain and pineal discharge disappeared, so the quality of life has improved dramatically."
CD011134,0,18622956,0,[Tumor surveillance after resection of colorectal cancer].,"Because recurrent adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum (CRC) can still be treated with acceptable 5-year survival rates, tumor surveillance plays an important role. Early detection of recurrent disease from CRC allows for effective treatment with intention for cure. This is why, in 2007, an interdisciplinary group modified the popular ""FAGAS"" criteria, a proposition for surveillance after curative resection of colorectal cancer. Proposed are the 3-monthly follow-up of the tumor marker CEA (carcino embryonic antigen), which, in case of lower sigmoid or rectal cancer, would be completed by rectosigmoidoscopy and endosonography every 6 months. As a major change liver sonography is now proposed to be replaced by annual thoraco-abdominal CT scan. Colonoscopy within the first year after resection has its place in the surveillance due to a high rate of metachronous secondary tumors missed in the initial endoscopy. Once completed it needs not to be repeated for at least 3 years. Only in cases where early stage CRC was been completely resected no schematic surveillance must take place."

There has been a strong emphasis on early detection of colon cancer, and fecal DNA-based methods have been developed to assist with early screening. Tissue-based assays have been utilized for many years to assess tumor aggressiveness and to determine prognosis and response to chemotherapeutic interventions. The most widely used serum marker for colon cancer (carcinoembryonic antigen) remains a useful modality to assess for occult disease following curative resection. Identification of tumor mutations in circulating tumor cells and microarray analysis holds a great deal of promise in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer. The inhibitors of apoptosis may be important markers to determine resistance to radiation cytotoxicity in rectal cancer.

CD011134,0,18501075,0,Correlation between rash and a positive drug response associated with bevacizumab in a patient with advanced colorectal cancer.,"Bevacizumab is the fi rst vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted agent shown to increase survival in patients receiving first- and second-line intravenous 5-FU-based chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Bevacizumab is typically well tolerated and its major side effects include hypertension, proteinuria, bleeding, gastrointestinal perforation and arterial thrombotic events. Although exfoliative dermatitis has been described as a side effect in 19% of patients, skin rash (type unspecified) has rarely been described in patients following infusion of bevacizumab. We recently reported the fi rst patient with colon cancer manifesting a correlation between rash and a positive drug response with bevacizumab. A 49-year old male with T3 N1 M1 rectal carcinoma received modified FOLFOX-6/bevacizumab, which he tolerated very well except for grade 2 skin rash related to bevacizumab. The rash continued to progress as the serum carcinoembryonic antigen decreased significantly. Computed tomography and positron emission tomography scan confirmed response to FOLFOX/bevacizumab. We therefore believe that this rash was linked to bevacizumab administration and correlated with response to therapy. Grade 1/2 rash has been described in patients after infusion of bevacizumab in initial phase I and II studies. Skin rash was observed in 34% and 46% of patients in the Kabbinavar's study receiving 5 mg/kg dose and 10 mg/kg respectively but no patient developed > grade 3 rash. This toxicity was not well described in pivotal phase III studies. On the other hand, acneiform rash occurs in > 90% patients who receive cetuximab and panitumumab, severity of which appears to be predictive of response. To our knowledge, this case report is the second report of possible correlation between rash and a positive drug response associated with bevacizumab and warrants further investigation of similar observation."

Patients with stage IV metastatic colorectal carcinoma received lomeguatrib (40 mg) and TMZ (50-200 mg m(-2)) orally for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks. Response was determined every two cycles. Pharmacokinetics of lomeguatrib and TMZ as well as their pharmacodynamic effects in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were determined. Nineteen patients received 49 cycles of treatments. Despite consistent depletion of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase in PBMC, none of the patients responded to treatment. Three patients had stable disease, one for the duration of the study, and no fall in carcinoembryonic antigen was observed in any patient. Median time to progression was 50 days. The commonest adverse effects were gastrointestinal and haematological and these were comparable to those of TMZ when given alone. This combination of lomeguatrib and TMZ is not efficacious in metastatic colorectal cancer. If further studies are to be performed, emerging data suggest that higher daily doses of lomeguatrib and a dosing period beyond that of TMZ should be evaluated."

During the median follow-up period of 30 months, recurrence developed in 14% of gastric cancer and 23% of colorectal cancer patients. A false positive with the tumor marker was frequently observed in patients after gastrectomy compared with after colorectal surgery. The sensitivity of the marker monitoring regarding early detection of recurrence was higher in patients with colorectal cancer than those with gastric cancer, especially in cases of advanced stage. As a result, the accuracy of marker monitoring for the detection of recurrence was higher in patients after the resection of colorectal cancer than that of gastric cancer. Surgeons and oncologists should thus be aware that the role of the tumor marker monitoring after a curative operation differs between patients with gastric and colorectal cancers."

CD011134,0,18219932,0,[A case of refractory inguinal lymphorrhea cured by lipiodol lymphangiography].,"We report a case of inguinal lymphorrhea cured by Lipiodol lymphangiography. The patient was a 80-year-old female who underwent an abdomino-perineal resection with lateral pelvic lymph node dissection and inguinal lymph node extraction for anal canal cancer. Histologically, the tumor was a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and considered to be stage IV (a2, n3 (+), P0, H3, M (-), cur C) in the Japanese classification of colorectal cancer. We recognized a lot of lymph node metastases in dissected lateral pelvic lymph node and inguinal lymph node. By hepatic arterial infusion using 5-FU (1250 mg/body weekly), the liver metastases had a complete response after 15 courses. She noticed a left inguinal lymph node swelling and an elevation of serum CEA level (79.5 ng/mL) was observed. There was no evidence of recurrence except left inguinal lymph nodes. She underwent a left inguinal lymph node dissection. Serous discharge from a surgical site persisted despite of conservative therapy such as compression. She received lymphangiography using 8 mL of Lipiodol from left dorsum of foot. We found three lymph ducts heading to left groin and observed a lot of Lipiodol leakage from ducts. We determined not only the site of leakage but we also confirmed a gradual decrease and a complete stop of lypmphorrhea in 7 days after lymphangiography. Slight lymph edema of left lower extremity appeared but gradually relieved. Lymphangiography using Lipiodol helps determine the site of leakage and may be an effective therapeutic modality for treating refractory lymphorrhea."

In the 27 patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer, CPT-DSM therapy was performed 47 times. All of these patients were a contra indication of hepatectomy. We compared a tumor marker before and after the treatment, and measured a serum level of SN-38, which is an active substance of CPT-11 and resolved from CPT-11. Although the level of CPT-11 was wearing off after CPT-DSM therapy, the peak of SN-38 level delayed 1 hour after the infusion. The CEA and CA19-9 levels were decreased to 54.2% and to 45.1% of the level before the treatment, respectively. Nine of the partial response and stable disease patients underwent surgery. The response rate was 59%. A 3-year survival rate was 20%. These results suggest that CPT-DSM therapy is one of the most effective anticancer agents. This TACE can be a feasible therapy for colorectal liver metastases as the first-line therapy."

The patient was an 82-year-old female. She underwent radical resection for sigmoid colon cancer in 1998 and right lobectomy of the liver for metastatic liver tumor in 2001. A follow up CT revealed the metastasis to the bilateral lung on November 2003. Then she received a treatment with UFT plus low-dose CPT-11/CDDP and activated autologous lymphocytes. Although the response of the treatment was SD, the serum CEA level decreased to a normal range. The treatment continued with delayed administration for 30 months while CEA and the size of the tumors increased very slowly.

This resulted in disappearance of the pleural effusion and ascites, as well as negative tumor markers. Surgery was performed for sigmoid colon cancer on September 29, 2004. In February 2006, abdominal swelling was observed, and CEA increased to 15 ng/mL with multiple intraabdominal tumor nodules. The patient was diagnosed as having peritonitis carcinomatosis associated with recurrent sigmoid colon cancer, and was treated with FOLFOX 4. CEA was 134.9 ng/mL before treatment, but became negative after six courses, while his pleural effusion and ascites disappeared after 10 courses of treatment.

CD011134,0,18043108,0,Prognostic significance of multiple molecular markers for patients with stage II colorectal cancer undergoing curative resection.,The aim of this study was to determine whether our constructed high-sensitivity colorimetric membrane-array method could detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood of stage II colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and so identify a subgroup of patients who are at high risk for relapse.
CD011134,0,18023132,0,Resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal carcinoma.,"Although pulmonary metastases from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) often represent systemic and uncontrolled tumour growth, in a number of patients lung disease is limited and the patient remains well. When the metastases can be removed, long term survival is a possibility, with 5- and 10-year survivals in the order of 44% and 25%. Chemotherapy, the only alternative treatment only very rarely leads to survival beyond 24 months. Pulmonary metastases which are suitable for resection are usually detected on chest radiography, especially when carried out during monitoring of patients. They are rarely a cause of symptoms and the majority of patients have otherwise healthy lungs. CT scans supplemented by PET scans usually confirm the diagnosis, but percutaneous biopsy is sometimes necessary to exclude a primary lung cancer. The criteria for resecting CRC pulmonary metastases are (1) the primary tumour is controlled or is controllable; (2) complete resection is possible; and (3) the patient has adequate pulmonary reserve to tolerate the planned resection. Surgical approaches include posterolateral thoracotomy, staged bilateral thoracotomies, median sternotomy, clamshell incision, and video-assisted thoracic surgery. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. The majority of patients having resection of pulmonary metastases from CRC recover well with very few post-operative complications. Following resection favourable prognostic factors include a long disease-free interval, small number and small size of metastases, a normal carcinoembryonic antigen level, and an absence of concomitant liver metastases and mediastinal lymph node spread. Surgery for pulmonary metastases of CRC remains the best means of local control and the best way to render the patient disease-free. Patients with complete resection of pulmonary metastases have an improved long-term survival when compared to patients with unresected metastases."

CD011134,0,17921088,0,Colorectal cancer: imaging surveillance following resection of primary tumour.,"Most patients with colorectal cancer undergo treatment with curative intent and subsequently enter a surveillance programme. The primary aim of surveillance is to identify patients with disease relapse at a resectable stage. However, the identification of local recurrence and metachronous carcinoma are also important aspects of follow up. Patients under observation may be referred for imaging either because regular imaging forms part of the surveillance strategy, or because tumour relapse is suggested by the development of new symptoms or a rise in tumour markers. This paper reviews the use of new and existing imaging techniques during surveillance following resection of primary colorectal cancer. The use of imaging for this surveillance is an application of cancer imaging that is supported by evidence-based clinical guidelines. Computed tomography provides the mainstay modality on grounds of good overall diagnostic performance combined with high availability and low cost. Improvements in survival with more aggressive follow up and treatment are likely to demand more accurate imaging techniques in the future."

CD011134,0,17868775,0,Colorectal adenocarcinoma involving the prostate: report of 9 cases.,"We present 9 consult cases, the largest series to date, of colorectal adenocarcinoma involving the prostate. Mean age of patients at diagnosis was 61 years (range, 42-78 years). Six cases were initially diagnosed on needle biopsy and the others by transurethral resection. Three cases were diagnosed before biopsy of the colon, which led to the discovery of a primary colonic tumor. The mean interval between the detection of the primary colonic tumor and prostatic involvement in the other 6 cases was 30 months (range, 1-52 months). At diagnosis, the stages of colorectal carcinomas were pT1 (n=2), pT2 (n=2), pT3 (n=2), and pT4 (n=3). Two cases involved the prostate after the recurrence of rectal adenocarcinoma at the anastomotic site of the previous colonic resection. In most cases, the tumors were typical moderately differentiated with occasional poorly differentiated foci. Other histologic features included desmoplastic stromal reaction (100%, n=9), necrosis (77.8%, n=7), chronic inflammatory response (77.8%, n=7), cribriform pattern (66.7%, n=6), villous architecture (22.2%, n=2), mucin production (22.2%, n=2), signet-ring cells (11.1%, n=1), and perineural invasion (11.1%, n=1). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for beta-catenin in 6 of 6 cases, CDX2 in 6 of 6 cases, carcinoembryonic antigen in 7 of 7 cases, CK20 in 5 of 6 cases, high-molecular-weight cytokeratin in 5 of 6 cases, and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase in 3 of 6 cases. Stains were negative in all cases for prostate-specific antigen, P501S (prostein), and CK7. Six patients (66.7%) died of disease within an average of 34 months (range, 8-88 months) after diagnosis of prostatic involvement. There are critical therapeutic and prognostic implications for distinguishing between prostatic adenocarcinoma and colorectal carcinoma involving the prostate. Colorectal adenocarcinoma should be considered on prostate sampling when carcinoma exhibits either ""dirty"" necrosis, tall columnar epithelium with mucin production, mucin-positive signet-ring cells, villous architecture, or associated inflammation. Immunohistochemical stains for beta-catenin, CDX2, carcinoembryonic antigen, high-molecular-weight cytokeratin, prostate-specific antigen, P501S (prostein), CK20, and CK7 can be helpful in making a definitive diagnosis."

CD011134,0,17823231,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing in colorectal cancer follow up: what do patients think?,"The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) blood test is included in most colorectal cancer follow up protocols, despite little clear evidence for its cost-effectiveness and survival benefit. In this study, patients' views were sought on the use of the CEA blood test in their follow up. Strong associations were found between the age of a patient's children and their concern about cancer recurrence and between concern about recurrence and anxiety about CEA test results (p<0.0001). Many patients expressed a desire for prognostic information, however uncertain or poor. Patients' views should be sought when designing colorectal cancer follow up protocols to ensure their needs are adequately addressed."
CD011134,0,17786336,0,Rapid genetic diagnosis with transcription-reverse transcription concerted reaction system for peritoneal recurrence and survival in colorectal cancer patients.,"The prediction of peritoneal recurrence in colorectal cancer patients is required for improvement of prognosis. In this study, we focused on establishing a novel rapid RNA direct amplification system with transcription-reverse transcription concerted reaction (TRC) to detect carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mRNA in peritoneal washings, and its usefulness as a prophylactic tool for peritoneal recurrence and survival in patients with colorectal cancer. Peritoneal washes were obtained from 161 patients with colorectal cancer during laparotomy. CEA mRNA and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) mRNA levels of peritoneal washes were detected using the TRC method. Genetic detection in the CEA mRNA of peritoneal washes by TRC showed a significant correlation to the depth of invasion, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, lymph node metastasis, peritoneal dissemination and stage. The overall survival and peritoneal recurrence-free survival rates of CEA mRNA-positive patients were significantly poorer than those of marker gene-negative patients. CEA mRNA levels in peritoneal washes were a significant independent prognostic factor for overall survival and peritoneal recurrence-free survival. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the detection of CEA mRNA in peritoneal washings by TRC is a useful, rapid genetic diagnosis for the prediction of peritoneal recurrence and survival in patients with colorectal cancer."

The patient presented cancer recurrence after 12 months, and underwent a paraaortic lymphadenoctomy and a second adjuvant chemotherapy with the folfox regimen. Abdomen computerized tomography revealed two solid masses in the right kidney, without evidence of any other metastatic sites. A nephrectomy was performed in the right kidney followed by adjuvant chemotherapy."
CD011134,0,17762405,0,Adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil in a patient with colorectal cancer and Familial Mediterranean Fever.,"Colorectal cancer is a common malignancy often requiring adjuvant chemotherapy. Familial Mediterranean Fever is a chronic hereditary disease which is relatively prevalent in the Middle East and is associated with recurrent episodes of serosal, synovial or cutaneous inflammations. The aim of this paper was to describe a patient with Familial Mediterranean Fever who received fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. A 56-year-old man with Familial Mediterranean Fever and amyloidosis was referred for evaluation and treatment following surgery for colorectal cancer. In light of his relatively young age, good general state of health and apparently well-controlled Familial Mediterranean Fever, he was treated with chemotherapy consisting of four cycles of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin. The patient's clinical course during chemotherapy was unremarkable except for one minor attack of Familial Mediterranean Fever. The patient's follow-up was notable for periodic fluctuations in serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels, up to 4-fold of normal. The Familial Mediterranean Fever remained stable. Although our patient showed a good tolerability of treatment, the administration of chemotherapy to patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever raises several concerns. These include a potential deterioration in the Familial Mediterranean Fever status owing to chemotherapy-induced stress, the potential effect of Familial Mediterranean Fever or its treatment on the tolerability of chemotherapy and an overlapping toxicity of the drugs used to treat the two diseases. An increase in serum carcinoembryonic antigen in this setting may be related to the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of Familial Mediterranean Fever but does not necessarily indicate disease recurrence. Clinicians should be aware of these issues considering the recent worldwide increase in colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,17715643,0,Thoracoabdominal wall tumour seeding after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for recurrent colorectal liver metastatic lesion: a case report with a brief literature review.,"Radiofrequency is a safe and effective minimally invasive procedure in the treatment of liver and other organs neoplastic lesions. Percutaneous access of neoplastic liver tissue is the most common access and electrodes are placed with imaging guidance into the tumour to be ablated. Complications during and after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are of major or minor severity. Tumour dissemination related to the percutaneous access seems to be very unusual. Herein, we present a rare case of thoracoabdominal tumour wall dissemination after RFA of a recurrent hepatic colorectal metastasis previously removed by surgery. A 64-year-old man with a recurrent hepatic metastatic lesion was treated with internally cooled radiofrequency (RF) for ablation of a 3x3 cm in size tumour mass. Two sessions of RFA in one-month period were performed. Computed tomography (CT) of the upper abdomen and carcinoembryonic (CEA) antigen were used for estimation of the disease progression in the patient's follow-up. Ten months after RFA the patient presented abdominal pain and a mass appeared on the right thoracoabdominal area with simultaneous lung metastases. In conclusion, a large size, bulky and superficial mass on the liver parenchyma adjacent to the thoracoabdominal wall as well as multiple RFA sessions, seem to represent risk factors for tumour dissemination through the needle electrode used during the RFA procedure in hepatic metastases of colorectal cancer."

Patients underwent surgery 6th week after the completion of chemoradiotherapy. Biopsies of rectal carcinoma were taken before starting therapy and 14 days after its cesation. Biopsies were examined for TS, DPD and TP mRNA levels. CEA in serum was examined to monitor relapses. Both TP and TS mRNA increase two weeks after starting therapy (p<0,001). TP mRNA median levels were elevated 2,3x after starting therapy. Moreover responders exhibit 1,5x higher induction than non-responders both before and after starting therapy, but difference is significant before therapy only (p=0,017). Non-responders have most frequent TS induction. Complete remission was observed in 17% and substantial responses with microscopic residuum only in additional 19% of cases were achieved. The pathologic downstaging rate was 76%. Our data show that TS and TP mRNA are induced by preoperative chemoradiotherapy in both responders and nonresponders. TP induction is in accordance with the expected role of TP in the activation of capecitabine and the known promoting role of TP in tissue fibrosis frequently associated with tumor regression."

Lack of specificity and sensitivity preclude the use of all existing serum markers for the early detection of CRC. For patients with stage II or stage III CRC who may be candidates for either liver resection or systemic treatment should recurrence develop, CEA should be measured every 2-3 months for at least 3 years after diagnosis. Insufficient evidence exists to recommend routine use of tissue factors such as thymidylate synthase, microsatellite instability (MSI), p53, K-ras and deleted in colon cancer (DCC) for either determining prognosis or predicting response to therapy in patients with CRC. Microsatellite instability, however, may be used as a pre-screen for patients with suspected hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer.

An endoscopic examination revealed advanced ascending colon cancer, and abdominal CT scan demonstrated enlarged metastatic lymph nodes of superior mesenteric arterial circumference. The Serum CEA rose considerably. The preoperative diagnosis was cStage IV (SS, N(4), P(0), H(0), M(-)), and right colectomy was performed on March 2, 2005. The metastatic lymph nodes around the superior mesenteric arterial root macroscopically remained. From the 20th postoperative day, we started combination chemotherapy using S-1 plus CPT-11 as one course for three weeks. S-1 (120 mg/body/day) was orally administered for 2 weeks continuously, and CPT-11 (80 mg/m(2)) was done intravenously on day 1 and 8. Serum CEA was normalized in the middle of 3 courses. Moreover, after 13 courses, a complete response (CR) was noted on the follow-up abdominal CT scan. No severe side effect more than grade 2 was observed, there was no interruption of the dosage, and PS was sufficiently maintained kept enough through this combination chemotherapy. The course has been without metastasis, recurrence and a rise of serum CEA now in the 16th postoperative month. S-1/CPT-11 combination chemotherapy is a promising and effective cure for unresectable progressive recurrent colorectal cancer in future."
CD011134,0,17487561,0,Comparative analysis of intraperitoneal minimal free cancer cells between colorectal and gastric cancer patients using quantitative RT-PCR: possible reason for rare peritoneal recurrence in colorectal cancer.,"Peritoneal recurrence has a much lower incidence in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients than gastric cancer (GC) patients. The aim of this study is to clarify the reason for the rare peritoneal recurrence in CRC as compared with GC. The incidence and the abundance of free tumor cells in the peritoneal lavages from 102 CRC and 126 GC patients who underwent curative surgery were assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 20 (CK20) as genetic markers. Prognostic significance of CEA and CK20 mRNA was also compared between CRC and GC after 2 years of follow-up by Kaplan-Meyer method with overall and peritoneal recurrence-free survival as endpoints. Positivity rate and average values of CEA and CK20 mRNA in peritoneal lavages of CRC patients, which are correlated to the depth of tumor invasion (pT category), were essentially the same as those of GC cases. Overall survival was significantly (marginally) worse in CEA mRNA (CK20 mRNA)-positive CRC patients than negatives like GC. However, peritoneal recurrence-free survival was not different between CEA (CK20) mRNA-positive and -negative CRC patients, in quite contrast to GC cases. Multivariate analysis showed that CEA mRNA was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in GC patients, but not in CRC patients. These results suggest that the rare peritoneal recurrence in CRC patients is not due to the low incidence or the small number of intraperitoneal free cancer cells, but more likely reflects due to the low-peritoneal metastatic potential of CRC cells."

We retrospectively examined the relation between preoperative absolute counts of peripheral blood leukocyte subsets and clinicopathologic factors and long-term prognosis in 97 patients with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer who underwent hepatic resection. Median preoperative peripheral blood leukocyte subset counts were as follows: neutrophils 3148/mm3; lymphocytes 1574/mm3; monocytes 380/mm3. Univariate analysis indicated significantly worse 5-year cancer-related survival for patients with a peripheral blood monocyte count >300/mm3 (67.5%) than for patients with a count <or=300/mm3 (36.8%). Multivariate analysis showed a preoperative peripheral blood monocyte count >300/mm3 and preoperative CEA level (>10 ng/ml) to be independent predictive factors for cancer-related survival after hepatic resection. The preoperative peripheral monocyte count correlated positively with white blood cell and neutrophil counts, but not with the tumor number, interval between colorectal and hepatic surgery, or preoperative serum CEA level. Our findings indicate that a preoperative absolute peripheral blood monocyte count >300/mm3 is an independent predictive factor for cancer-related survival of patients with colorectal liver metastasis who have undergone hepatic resection."

CD011134,0,17430690,0,Shifting from clinical to biologic indicators of prognosis after resection of hepatic colorectal metastases.,"Following resection of hepatic colorectal metastases, there are few criteria for predicting which patients have more aggressive disease and are, therefore, more likely to experience recurrence and reduced survival. Traditionally, primary tumor stage, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level, time from primary tumor treatment to diagnosis of hepatic metastases (disease-free interval), hepatic tumor size, number of hepatic metastases, and presence of extrahepatic disease have been reported to be predictors of survival after resection. However, the data regarding the prognostic importance of these clinicopathologic factors are inconsistent and conflicting. Therefore, conventional clinicopathologic factors may be inadequate for the purposes of prognostication. More recently, there has been increased interest in identifying biologic indicators that may help better define patients at risk for recurrence after hepatic resection for colorectal metastases. Recent studies have shown that proliferation markers such as p53 expression, tritiated thymidine uptake, thymidylate synthase, Ki-67, and human telomerase reverse transcriptase may be better predictors of outcome after resection of hepatic colorectal metastases. Moreover, tumor response to preoperative chemotherapy may also prove to be a useful predictor of outcome following liver resection for colorectal metastases."

CD011134,0,17342309,0,Pelvic recurrence after Miles' operation for anastomotic recurrence in a patient with stage I rectal cancer invading the proper muscle layer: Case report.,"We performed D2 low anterior resection in a patient with stage I rectal cancer [pathological diagnosis: proper muscle (pm) invasion, n0, lymphatic invasion (ly), (-); venous invasion (v), (-); anal margin, (-)]. The tumor recurred at the anastomotic site approximately one year later and was treated with Miles' operation [pm, n0, ly (+); v (-); deep border of the primary tumor (-)]. The tumor marker CEA increased to 50.4 ng/ml at four months after surgery and pelvic local recurrence was detected. Since then, the patient has been receiving chemoradiotherapy on an out-patient basis. Cytokeratin immunostaining of all the lymph nodes collected during the two operations showed clusters of occult neoplastic cells (ONCs) in the perinodal fat around the nodes harvested at the first operation. These findings suggest that the risk of local recurrence of rectal cancer is increased even in stage I disease if ONCs are found in the perinodal fat.

Ninety-eight consecutive patients with histologically confirmed rectal cancer were studied prospectively with five-year follow-up. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and differences between curves were tested by the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression model. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 63.6%. Mean time of recurrence was 13.8 months (range 3-38). Local recurrence rate was 7.8% with the mean time of 12.7 months (range 3-25). In univariate analysis Dukes' stage (RFS for stage: A=93.2%; B=53.8%; C=26.3%) and preoperative CEA serum level (s-CEA) (for s-CEA<or=5 ng/ml RFS=93.8%; for s-CEA>5 ng/ml RFS=5.9%) significantly influenced survival (P<0.005 and P<0.00001). These parameters were also found to be independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis (P<0.05 and P<0.00001). Survival was worse in older female patients with low-localised poorly differentiated tumors; however, those variables had not significant impact on prognosis. Neither symptom duration nor mucinous histology was significantly related to survival. Using TME technique a low local recurrence rate resulting in improved survival can be achieved. Apart from clinicopathological staging, elevated s-CEA can identify patients with poor prognosis. In addition to TME adjuvant therapy for this high-risk group should be considered."

CD011134,0,17096339,0,Successful cancer vaccine therapy for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-expressing colon cancer using genetically modified dendritic cells that express CEA and T helper-type 1 cytokines in CEA transgenic mice.,"This study was designed to determine whether the vaccination of genetically modified dendritic cells (DCs) simultaneously expressing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) can overcome the peripheral T-cell tolerance to CEA and thereby elicit a therapeutic response in CEA transgenic mice. CEA transgenic mice were immunized once by subcutaneous injection with DCs adenovirally transduced with CEA and T helper-type 1 cytokine genes. The cytotoxic activity of spleen cells against CEA-expressing tumors, MC38-CEA, in the mice immunized with DCs expressing CEA (DC-AxCACEA) was higher than that in those immunized with DCs-AxCALacZ (p < 0.0001), and was augmented by the cotransduction with the GM-CSF/IL-12 gene (p < 0.05). The vaccination with DC-AxCACEA/GM-CSF/IL-12 could elicit a more potent therapeutic immunity than the vaccination with DC-AxCACEA in subcutaneous tumor models (p < 0.0001), and 4 of 5 mice showed a complete eradication of the subcutaneous tumors in these vaccination groups. Even in a large tumor model, this vaccination therapy completely eliminated the subcutaneous tumors in all mice. This antitumor activity mostly vanished with the depletion of CD8(+) T cells and NK cells in vivo and was completely abrogated with the depletion of CD4(+) T cells. A histopathological examination showed no evidence of an autoimmune reaction. No other adverse effects were observed. This vaccination strategy resulted in the generation of highly efficient therapeutic immune responses against MC38-CEA in the absence of autoimmune responses and demonstrated no adverse effects, and may therefore be useful for future clinical applications as a cancer vaccine therapy."

CD011134,0,18175226,0,Solitary adrenal metastasis in a patient with sigmoid colon cancer; report of a case.,"A 73-year-old man had sigmoidectomy for sigmoid colon cancer in December 2001. Although he was followed regularly with chemotherapy, his serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) increased on August 2002. Abdominal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a right adrenal mass and no other abnormality. The preoperative diagnosis was a solitary adrenal metastasis from sigmoid colon cancer; the lesion was removed in September 2002. On pathology, adrenal metastasis was confirmed. Although the patient's serum CEA normalized soon thereafter, 12 months after adrenalectomy, the CEA again increased; the patient had local recurrence of the resected adrenal lesion and liver metastasis. Therefore, the patient was given systemic chemotherapy, but his condition deteriorated, and he died 38 months after adrenalectomy. Adrenal metastasis from colorectal cancer is not unusual; however, a solitary metastasis is rarely found and resected surgically. As surgical treatment of the metastatic lesion could improve patients' prognosis to some extent if it is detected early, the possibility of adrenal metastasis should be kept in mind when colorectal cancer patients are followed."

Laparotomy findings showed H0, P0, and lymph-nodes swelling observed at LN253-LN16b2. Massive tumor thrombosis was present in IMV, the splenic vein, and the advanced region in the portal vein. Metastatic tumor was present in the pancreas body. An anterior resection of the colon combined with resection of lymph nodes, pancreas body and tail and spleen were performed. Resection of IMV and splenic vein including tumor thrombosis was performed prudently. Histological examination revealed that the pancreas tumor and tumor thrombosis were of the same origin (moderately differentiated from adenorarcinoma), and massive LN metastases existed.

CD011134,0,17212120,0,[A clinical study of therapy for local recurrent rectal cancer].,"To evaluate the therapy for local recurrent rectal cancer, we examined clinicopathological characteristics and prognoses of 54 local recurrent rectal cancer patients. The cumulative 5 year survival rate was 20.3%, 3-year survival rate was 74% for a curative surgery group, 21.8% for a non-curative surgery group and 0% for a non surgery group. There were significant differences in the rates of three year survival between the curative surgery group and non surgery group, but there were no differences between the non curative surgery group and non-surgery group. A survival analysis showed that prognoses of patients ew (-) or CEA under 10 ng/ml group were statistically better than the other group. Thirty four patients underwent operation. The mean operation time and the mean blood loss were 334.2 minutes and 1977 ml, respectively. Eighteen patients had some complications associated with the operation. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy did not contribute to improve survival rate, but contribute to improved symptoms. In conclusion, curative surgery is the only therapy for local recurrent rectal cancer to improve survival rates, but there are many complications associated with non curative surgery. We therefore must evaluate the indication of operation carefully."
CD011134,0,17212112,0,[A case of high-dose rate interstitial brachytherapy for locally recurrent rectal cancer].,"The patient was a 55-year-old female who underwent an abdomino-perineal resection for advanced lower rectal cancer. The tumor was a well differentiated adenocarcinoma, type 2 in the Japanese classification of colorectal carcinoma, and was measured 2.3 cm in size. Histologically, the tumor was considered to be stage IIIb (mp, n3(+), P0, H0, M(-)). She received adjuvant chemotherapy with 5'-DFUR. After 13 months from the surgery, the patient developed a hip pain. After 16 months from the surgery, a pelvic MRI scan revealed a 3 cm tumor in the perineum. Biopsy from the tumor revealed adenocarcinoma. Consequently, we diagnosed local recurrence in the perineum. Chemotherapy with CPT-11 (230 mg/body) and 5'-DFUR (800 mg/body) was administered for 2 cycles. Because the tumor was enlarged, high-dose rate interstitial brachytherapy was given to the recurrent site at a total dose of 54 Gy/9 fractions/5 days. There were no severe complications. CEA was decreased within normal range from a maximum of 9.3. No progress was detected on CT and MRI, and the hip pain had disappeared. The tumor marker is within normal range for about 2 years and QOL was improved. Hence, high dose rate interstitial brachytherapy appears to be effective for locally recurrent rectal cancer."

In October 2002, a radical resection of the original tumor and liver metastases were performed at a previous hospital. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as Stage IV. He was treated with an oral anticancer agent as an adjuvant therapy. In January 2005, the CEA level was increased to 3.2 ng/ml and CT scan revealed a solitary liver metastasis. Partial resection of the liver was performed. On admission to our hospital, a systemic chemotherapy by FOLFOX4 was begun. The liver metastases showed 61% reduction in size and were judged to be PR. However, the intrathoracic lymph node size was not changed. Therefore, VATS extirpation of the mediastinal lymph node was performed. After 10 courses of FOLFOX4, abdominal CT revealed liver metastases remained to be almost the same size. In January 2006, radio frequency ablation (RFA) and partial hepatectomy were enforced and then, the tumor marker returned to normal.

CD011134,0,17116621,1,Multivariate analysis of prognostic determinants for colorectal cancer patients with high preoperative serum CEA levels: prognostic value of postoperative serum CEA levels.,"High preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels have been well investigated and found to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it has been observed that the outcome varies after curative resection, along with postoperative serum CEA levels; some patients continue to have high postoperative serum CEA levels while postoperative CEA levels return to normal in others. The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of postoperative serum CEA levels in CRC patients with high preoperative serum CEA levels. Between January 2002 and December 2004, 423 CRC patients underwent operation in our hospital; 181 (42.8%) had high preoperative serum CEA levels and were enrolled in this study. Among the 181 patients, 165 patients had curative resection; the remaining 16 had stage IV disease, so they underwent palliative surgery and were subsequently excluded from analysis. Pre- and postoperative serum CEA levels were measured and analyzed. All patients had curative resection and were divided into two groups according to postoperative serum CEA levels: one group comprised patients with postoperative serum CEA > or = 5 ng/mL (n = 80) and the other group comprised patients with postoperative serum CEA levels < 5 ng/mL (n = 85). Postoperative serum CEA levels were significantly related to location of primary tumors (p = 0.042), lymph node metastases (p = 0.009), TNM stage (p = 0.001), and postoperative relapse (p = 0.004). The results of multivariate analysis showed that both lymph node metastases and high postoperative serum CEA levels (> or = 5 ng/mL) were independent prognostic factors for CRC patients after curative resection. Postoperative serum CEA levels can be a single independent prognostic determinant in CRC patients with high preoperative serum CEA levels. Intensive follow-up and adjuvant therapy may be necessary in CRC patients who continue to have high postoperative serum CEA levels even after curative resection."
CD011134,0,17114081,0,FDG-PET in colorectal cancer.,"[18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is a useful imaging tool in the evolving management of patients with colorectal carcinoma. This technique is able to measure and visualize metabolic changes in cancer cells. This feature results in the ability to distinguish viable tumor from scar tissue, in the detection of tumor foci at an earlier stage than possible by conventional anatomic imaging and in the measurement of alterations in tumor metabolism, indicative of tumor response to therapy. Nowadays, FDG-PET plays a pivotal role in staging patients before surgical resection of recurrence and metastases, in the localization of recurrence in patients with an unexplained rise in serum carcinoembryonic antigen and in assessment of residual masses after treatment. In the presurgical evaluation, FDG-PET may be best used in conjunction with anatomic imaging in order to combine the benefits of both anatomical (CT) and functional (PET) information, which leads to significant improvements in preoperative liver staging and preoperative judgment on the feasibility of resection. Integration of FDG-PET into the management algorithm of these categories of patients alters and improves therapeutic management, reduces morbidity due to futile surgery, leads to substantial cost savings and probably also to a better patient outcome. FDG-PET also appears to have great potential in monitoring the success of local ablative therapies soon after intervention and in the prediction and evaluation of response to radiotherapy, systemic therapy, and combinations thereof. This review aims to outline the current and future role of FDG-PET in the field of colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,17114079,0,PET/CT: will it change the way that we use CT in cancer imaging?,"Accurate staging of cancer is of fundamental importance to treatment selection and planning. Current staging paradigms focus, first, on a detailed delineation of the primary tumour in order to determine its suitability for resection, and, thereafter, on assessment of the presence of metastatic spread that would alter the surgical approach, or mandate non-surgical therapies. This approach has, at its core, the assumption that the best, and sometimes the only, way to cure a patient of cancer is by surgical resection. Unfortunately, all non-invasive techniques in current use have imperfect ability to identify those primary tumours that are able to be completely excised, and even worse ability to define the extent of metastatic spread. Nevertheless, because of relatively low cost and widespread availability, computed tomography (CT) scanning is the preferred methodology for tumour, nodal and systemic metastasis (TNM) staging. This is often supplemented by other tests that have improved performance in particular staging domains. For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), mammography, or endoscopic ultrasound may be used as complementary tests for T-staging; surgical nodal sampling for N-staging; and bone scanning, MRI or ultrasound for M-staging. Accordingly, many patients undergo a battery of investigations but, even then, are found to have been incorrectly staged based on subsequent outcomes. Even for those staged surgically, pathology can only identify metastases within the resection specimens and has no capability for detecting remote disease. As a result of this, many patients undergo futile operations for disease that could never have been cured by surgery. In the case of restaging, the situation is even worse. The sequelae of prior treatment can be difficult to differentiate from residual cancer and the likelihood of successful salvage therapy is even less than at presentation. More deleteriously, patients may be subjected to additional morbid treatments when cure has already been achieved. Thus, in post-treatment follow-up, the presence and extent of disease is equally critical to treatment selection and patient outcome as it is in primary staging. One of the major strengths of positron emission tomography (PET)/CT as a cancer staging modality is its ability to identify systemic metastases. At any phase of cancer evaluation, demonstration of systemic metastasis has profound therapeutic and prognostic implications. Only in the absence of systemic metastasis does nodal status become important, and only when unresectable nodal metastasis has been excluded does T-stage become important. There are now accumulating data that PET/CT could be used as the first, rather than the last test to assess M- and N-stage for evaluating cancers with an intermediate to high pre-test likelihood of metastatic disease based on poor long-term survival. In this scenario, there is great opportunity for subsequently selecting and tailoring the performance of anatomically based imaging modalities to define the structural relations of abnormalities identified by PET, when this information would be of relevance to management planning. Primary staging of oesophageal cancer and restaging of colorectal cancer are illustrative examples of a new paradigm for cancer imaging."

Furthermore, patients with different tumor types show high levels of cell-free circulating DNA both in plasma and serum (quantitative approach) at the time of surgery. Our aim was to verify whether the level of cell-free DNA in plasma might help in detecting recurrences during follow-up of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. We studied 70 patients undergoing surgery for primary CRC. Plasma samples were obtained at the time of surgery and during follow-up. The cell-free circulating DNA in plasma was quantified by the Dipstick Kit method. At the time of surgery, in all patients, cell-free DNA levels in plasma were about 25 times higher in comparison with 20 healthy donors. In contrast, the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) value of this cohort of patients was altered in only about 37% of cases. During follow-up, cell-free DNA levels decreased progressively in tumor-free patients, while it increased in those developing recurrences or metastases. The results were further supported by qualitative analysis of circulating tumor-specific DNA, such as K-Ras mutations and p16(INK4a) promoter hypermethylation. These preliminary data confirm that plasma tumor DNA levels (i) are significantly higher in patients with CRC, (ii) decrease progressively in the follow-up period in tumor-free patients, and (iii) increase in patients with recurrence or metastasis. We suggest, therefore, that the quantification of plasma cell-free DNA might represent a useful tool for monitoring of CRC and, prospectively, for identifying high-risk individuals."

CEA was 1.68 ng/microl prior to colectomy. Adjuvant chemotherapy with weekly 5-FU and leucovorin intravenously was started following surgery and discontinued after 17 doses in May 1997. She received bilateral salpingo-ophorecctomy for metastatic cancer in August 1999. Intravenous chemotherapy was resumed with weekly 5-FU and leucovorin intravenously in August 1999. CEA was 93.8 ng/microl in November 1999. Intravenous chemotherapy was discontinued after 20 doses and oral chemotherapy with futraful and leucovorin was started in January 2000. CEA was found to be 240.3 ng/microl in December 1999 and then elevated to 1521.3 ng/microl in June 2001, which was 10 months after resection of metastatic ovarian cancer. No metastatic lesions could be detected, however, with image studies. The CEA decreased to 396.6 ng/microl three months later. Futraful was switched to uracil-tegafur (UFUR) in September 2001. The CEA for the patient ranged from 68.5 to 298.9 ng/microl for the following 5 years without aggressive chemotherapy. No evidence of recurrence could be demonstrated by imaging studies. The patient is not a smoker and denied exposure to a smoking environment. She was also not known to have persistent infections, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, or any benign tumors. The current case suggested that: (i) elevation of CEA is not necessarily well correlated with presence of metastatic colon cancer; (ii) some patients may live with elevated CEA for years without evidence of recurrence or metastasis; (iii) aggressive chemotherapy may not be necessary in patients with only elevated CEA."

Our review of the literature revealed that intensive colorectal follow-up should be performed even if the long-term survival benefit is small. The timing and investigations conducted in follow-ups diverge. The inconsistency of follow-ups is revealed by the fact that the leading USA and European societies propose different guidelines. One datum that the literature agrees on is that pancolonoscopy performed at 3-5 year intervals in colorectal cancer surgery patients supports diagnosis of adenomatous polyps and metachronous cancers. Cost analysis have shown that intensive follow-up would certainly exceed the cut-off point level set for every additional year of good quality of life."

The results showed that the course of plasma TIMP-1 from pre- to postoperative levels correlated with patient outcome (P=0.005). However, postoperative plasma TIMP-1 alone was strongly associated with patient outcome, high TIMP-1 predicting short survival (P=0.002). Combining postoperative TIMP-1 and CEA demonstrated that high TIMP-1 and CEA levels predicted poor outcome (P<0.0001); multivariate analysis identifying both parameters as strong prognostic factors for survival, LR and DM (P<0.0001).

CD011134,0,16804525,0,Intensive follow-up after liver resection for colorectal liver metastases: results of combined serial tumour marker estimations and computed tomography of the chest and abdomen - a prospective study.,"The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate an intensive follow-up programme using serial tumour marker estimations and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen in patients undergoing potentially curative resection of colorectal liver metastases. Seventy-six consecutive patients having undergone potentially curative resections of colorectal liver metastases in a single unit were followed up with a protocol of 3 monthly carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 estimations and contrast-enhanced spiral CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis for the first 2 years following surgery and 6 monthly thereafter. The median period of follow-up was 24 months (range 18-60). Recurrent tumour was classed as early if within 6 months of liver resection. Thirty-seven of the 76 patients (49%) developed recurrence on follow-up. Nineteen recurrences were in the liver alone (51%), 16 liver and extrahepatic (43%) and two extrahepatic alone (6%). Of the 19 patients with isolated liver recurrence, eight developed within 6 months of liver resection none of which were resectable. Of the 11 recurrences after 6 months, five (45%) were resectable. Of the 37 recurrences, CT indicated recurrence despite normal tumour markers in 19 patients. Tumour markers suggested recurrence before imaging in 12 and concurrently with imaging in 6. In the 12 patients who presented with elevated tumour markers before imaging, there was a median lag period of 3 months (range 1-21) in recurrence being detected on further serial imaging. Seventeen patients who developed recurrence had normal tumour markers before initial resection of their liver metastases. Of these 17, 10 (58%) had an elevation of tumour markers associated with recurrence. Over a median follow-up of 2 years following liver resection, the use of CT or tumour markers alone would have failed to demonstrate early recurrence in 12 and 18 patients respectively. A combination of tumour markers and CT detected significantly more (P < 0.05) recurrence than either modality alone. Tumour markers and CT should be used in combination in the follow-up of patients with resected colorectal liver metatases, including patients whose markers are normal at the time of initial liver resection."

Several clinicopathologic features have been studied to identify the prognostic factors that can provide information concerning the favorable or the poor outcome of colorectal cancer. In the present study, the relationship between serum CEA, p53 expression, and DNA index to the different clinicopathological characteristics of colorectal cancer patients was sought. Fifty patients with CRC were included in this study. p53 protein was detected immunohistochemically using specific monoclonal antibodies. Samples were investigated for DNA index using flow cytometry. In addition, the serum CEA was determined using ELISA. The results showed that 27/50 (54%) were positive for p53. Concerning CEA reactivity, it was found that 35/50 (70%) were reactive for CEA. These results indicate that CEA is more sensitive than p53 to detect colorectal cancer. There was a statistically significant difference between the recurrent and nonrecurrent groups in the CRC Duke's stages, survival time, serum CEA (p = 0.001, 0.016, < 0.001, respectively). Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test showed that the mean survival time for cases positive for both p53 and CEA is significantly different from cases positive for CEA only, positive for p53 only, and negative for both p53 and CEA (p = 0.0002). Survival time was statistically significant with respect to sex, p53, CEA, and Duke's stages (p = 0.006, 0.024, 0.001, 0.017, respectively). Cox regression model showed that the prognosis of colorectal cancer is influenced by sex, p53, CEA reactivity, and CRC Duke's stages (p = 0.014, 0.006, 0.019, 0.014, respectively). In conclusion, the use of more than one tumor marker may successfully aid in the prediction of colorectal cancer prognosis."

An observational cohort study of prospectively collected data on 135 patients who underwent cryoablation with or without resection for colorectal liver metastases was performed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the prognostic factors for overall DFS, cryosite DFS, remaining liver DFS, and extrahepatic DFS. Overall, 115 patients (85%) developed recurrence at the cryosite (44%), and the remaining patients developed recurrence at the liver (62%) and extrahepatic site (71%). In univariate analysis, preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were significant for overall DFS. Distribution of metastases, operation type, total number of metastases, number of cryotreated metastases, largest size of cryotreated metastasis, and postoperative CEA were significant for cryosite DFS. The number of cryotreated metastases and postoperative CEA were significant for remaining liver DFS. The largest size of cryotreated metastasis, and preoperative and postoperative CEA were significant for extrahepatic DFS. In multivariate analysis, resection plus cryoablation, < or =7 liver metastases and < or =3 cm cryotreated metastasis were independently associated with an improved cryosite DFS. Preoperative CEA of < or =5 ng/mL was independently associated with an improved overall and extrahepatic DFS. The role of CEA in colorectal metastasis is important.

DiAcSpm was more sensitive than CEA for detecting colorectal cancer patients, while DiAcSpd was highly specific for malignant conditions in that the excretion of the latter was scarcely elevated in cases of benign urogenital diseases. An ELISA procedure for rapid determination of DiAcSpm was developed to promote the clinical application of these new tumor markers, and subsequent studies indicated that DiAcSpm was elevated in 60% of colorectal cancer patients at early stages (stage 0 + I), whereas only 10% of these patients were CEA-positive. DiAcSpm may also be useful as a follow-up marker that is efficient for detecting recurrence and sensitive to changes in the clinical condition of patients. The evidence accumulated so far indicates that DiAcSpm and DiAcSpd are promising novel tumor markers. They deserve more intensive studies, including studies of their biochemistry and metabolism."

The hilar lymph nodes were resected with the right upper lobe, and the initial diagnosis was colon cancer metastasis to the right hilar lymph nodes. Although the resection was incomplete, and no additional treatment was given, the patient remained free of recurrence for 10 years. This prompted us to reconsider our diagnosis using immunohistochemistry. The resected lymph nodes were found to be positive for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and cytokeratin 7, and negative for surfactant apoprotein (SAP), cytokeratin 20, and napsin A. The neuroendocrine markers and thyroglobulin were also negative. These findings led us to diagnose T0N1 lung cancer. There are reports of patients with clinical T0N1,2 lung cancer having exceptionally good prognoses despite noncurative treatment; however, to our knowledge, this is the first case of a patient with T0N1 lung cancer diagnosed by immunohistochemistry, with a good prognosis despite incomplete resection.

We sought to investigate the margin status, pattern of recurrence, and overall survival of patients with CLM treated with WR or AR. We identified 253 consecutive patients, in a multi-institutional database from 1991 to 2004, who underwent either WR or AR. WR was defined as a nonanatomic resection of the CLM, and AR was defined as single or multiple resections of one or two contiguous Couinaud segments. Clinicopathologic factors were analyzed with regard to pattern of recurrence and survival. One hundred six WRs were performed in 72 patients and 194 ARs in 181 patients. There was no difference in the rate of positive surgical margin (8.3%), overall recurrence rates, or patterns of recurrence between patients treated with WR vs. AR. Patients who had a positive surgical resection margin were more likely to recur at the surgical margin regardless of whether they underwent WR or AR. The median survival was 76.6 months for WR and 80.8 months for AR, with 5-year actuarial survival rates of 61% and 60%, respectively. AR is not superior to WR in terms of tumor clearance, pattern of recurrence, or survival. WR should remain an integral component of the surgical treatment of CLM."

Total of 21 patients with lung metastasis from colorectal cancer were included. They were treated with modified pharmacokinetic modulating chemotherapy (PMC). Eleven were also treated with RFA and/or radiotherapy (multi-modality group), and 10 were treated with chemotherapy alone (chemotherapy group). Characteristics and survival of patients in the multi-modality group were compared with those of the chemotherapy group. The median survival of all patients was 38.6 months after the initial PMC. The cumulative 3-year survival rate of patients in the multi-modality group was 87.5% compared with 33.3% in the chemotherapy group (p=0.0041). The course of multi-modality therapy was uneventful except for pneumothorax in those who received RFA. Although pneumothorax developed in 4 of 11 patients (36.4%) treated with RFA, all were able to receive chemotherapy within 2 weeks after RFA. In conclusion, multi-modality therapy combined with modified PMC, radiation and RFA is a feasible choice of treatment associated with reasonable morbidity and mortality in patients with inoperable lung metastases from colorectal cancer."

CD011134,0,16241086,0,[Prognostic factors for long-term outcome of hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastases].,"The aim of the study was to analyse the prognostic factors for long-term outcome of liver resections for metastases from colorectal cancer. The retrospective analysis included 297 liver resections for colorectal carcinoma liver metastases. The following prognostic factors were considered: age, gender, stage and grade of differentiation of the primary tumour, node metastases, site of the primary colorectal cancer, number and diameter of the hepatic lesions, time interval from primary cancer to liver metastases, preoperative CEA level, adjuvant chemotherapy after hepatic resection, type of hepatic resection, use of intraoperative ultrasound and portal triad clamping, blood loss and transfusions, postoperative complications and hospital stay, tumour-free surgical margins, clinical risk score (as defined by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre group, MSKCC-CRS). Overall survival rates were estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared at univariate analysis using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed including significant variables at univariate analysis using the Cox regression model. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. The 1, 3, 5 and 10-year overall survival rates were 90.6%, 51%, 27.5%, and 16.9%, respectively.

The multivariate analysis showed three independent negative prognostic factors: G3-G4 primary cancer, CEA level > 5 ng/ml, and high MSKCC-CRS class. No single prognostic factor turned out to be associated with such disappointing outcomes after hepatic surgery for colorectal liver metastases as to permit the identification of specific subgroups of patients to be excluded on principle from undergoing liver resection. However, in the presence of a number of specific prognostic factors (G3-G4 grade of differentiation of the primary tumour, preoperative CEA level > 5 ng/ml, high MSKCC-CRS) enrolment of the patient in trials exploring new diagnostic tools or new adjuvant treatments may be suggested to improve the preoperative staging of the disease and reduce the incidence of tumour recurrence after liver resection."

Surgical treatment consisted of laparoscopic ileo-cecal resection and lymph node dissection. At her nine months postoperative follow-up examination, her serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels had raised to 15.8ng/mL. Although computed tomography and colonoscopic examination were performed, lung, liver and local recurrence in the colon were not detected. FDG-PET was then performed and detected a higher concentration of FDG at the port site in the abdominal wall. Port site recurrence was diagnosed clinically and surgical resection of tumor at the port site was performed. Pathology revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma diagnosed as port site recurrence.

We report herein on an unusual case of a 40-year-old woman with a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-producing adenocarcinoma arising within a TGC who underwent surgical resection and local radiation therapy. Despite the complete resection, metastatic adenocarcinoma developed five months after surgery. CEA-producing adenocarcinoma from a TGC is extremely rare and only two cases, including this case, have been reported in the English medical literature. Besides CEA, the serum levels of CA 19-9 became markedly elevated in this patient.

CD011134,0,16100946,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen in the staging and follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer.,"CEA is a complex glycoprotein produced by 90% of colorectal cancers and contributes to the malignant characteristics of a tumor. It can be measured in serum quantitatively, and its level in plasma can be useful as a marker of disease. Because of its lack of sensitivity in the early stages of colorectal cancer, CEA measurement is an unsuitable modality for population screening. An elevated preoperative CEA is a poor prognostic sign and correlates with reduced overall survival after surgical resection of colorectal carcinoma. A failure of the CEA to return to normal levels after surgical resection is indicative of inadequate resection of occult systemic disease. Frequent monitoring of CEA postoperatively may allow identification of patients with metastatic disease for whom surgical resection or other localized therapy might be potentially beneficial. To identify this group, serial CEA measurement appears to be more effective than clinical evaluation or any other diagnostic modality, although its sensitivity for detecting recurrent disease is not as high for locoregional or pulmonary metastases as it is for liver metastases. Several studies have shown that a small percentage of patients followed postoperatively with CEA monitoring and who undergo CEA-directed salvage surgery for metastatic disease will be alive and disease-free 5 years after surgery. Furthermore, CEA levels after salvage surgery do appear to predict survival in patients undergoing resection of liver or pulmonary metastases. However, several authors argue that CEA surveillance is not cost-effective in terms of lives saved. In support of this argument, there is no clear difference in survival after resection of metastatic disease with curative intent between patients in whom the second-look surgery was performed on the basis of elevated CEA levels and those with other laboratory or imaging abnormalities. There is also no clear consensus on the frequency or duration of CEA monitoring, although the ASCO guidelines currently recommend every 2-3 months for at least 2 years after diagnosis. In the follow-up of patients undergoing palliative therapy, the CEA level correlates well with response, and CEA is indicative of not only response but may also identify patients with stable disease for whom there is also a demonstrated benefit in survival and symptom relief with combination chemotherapy. More recently, scintigraphic imaging after administration of radiolabeled antibodies afforded an important radionuclide technique that adds clinically significant information in assessing the extent and location of disease in patients with colorectal cancer above and beyond or complementary to conventional imaging modalities. Immunotherapy based on CEA is a rapidly advancing area of clinical research demonstrating antibody and T-cell responses."

We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 989 patients who underwent curative resection for colorectal cancer between July 1990 and December 1997, with a mean followup of 46 months (range, 3-129 months). When patients were divided into four subgroups with the cutoff values of s-CEA at 3,6, and 17 ng/mL, their 5-yr diseasefree survival rates were 85.3% (<3.0 ng/mL), 70.0% (3-6 ng/mL), 64.2% (6-17 ng/mL), and 55.2% (>17 ng/mL) (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that factors predictive of survival included age (p=0.028), tumor stage (p<0.001), cell differentiation (p=0.016), and gross type (p=0.007), location (p=0.003) and preoperative s-CEA (p<0.001).

The 1795 members of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons were asked, via a detailed questionnaire, how often they request 14 discrete follow-up modalities in their patients treated for cure with TNM stage I, II, or III rectal cancer over the first five post-treatment years. 566/1782 (32%) responded and 347 of the respondents (61%) provided evaluable data. Members of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons typically follow their own patients postoperatively rather than sending them back to their referral source. Office visit and serum CEA level are the most frequently requested items for each of the first five postoperative years. Endoscopy and imaging tests are also used regularly. Considerable variation exists among these highly experienced, highly credentialed experts. The surveillance strategies reported here rely most heavily on relatively simple and inexpensive tests. Endoscopy is employed frequently; imaging tests are employed less often. The observed variation in the intensity of postoperative monitoring is of concern."

A whole body emission scan was performed 60 minutes after injecting 370-555 MBq of F-18 FDG. ""PET volume"" and ""PET metabolic volume"" of tumors were measured on FDG PET images. Based on an isocontour plot of tumor mass at 2.5 SUV (standardized uptake value), the metabolically active tumor ""PET volume"" was calculated. ""PET metabolic volume"" was obtained by multiplying the ""PET volume"" by the mean SUV of the tumor. All recurrent or metastatic lesions were single or multiple lesions of measurable size (axial diameter > 1 cm, minimum ""PET volume"" 3.5 cm3), and were verified by operation or by other imaging modalities (CT or MRI). There was a linear associations between ""PET volume"" and serum CEA level. Further regression analysis by least squares showed a highly significant model with an equation of volume = 41.2 + 0.471 x CEA (r2 = 0.629). However, no such association was found between ""PET metabolic volume"" and serum CEA level according to the residual normality test. In conclusion, ""PET volume"" measured by FDG PET and serum CEA level in colorectal cancer are significantly correlated. Tumor volume determined by FDG PET can be used as an effective marker of tumor burden in postoperative patients with colorectal carcinoma."

The effort and effectiveness of these surveillance programs are controversially discussed. We analyzed the practiced follow-up of patients who had undergone a curative resection of colorectal cancer to demonstrate the difficulty to validate the performed surveillance program and to point out possible improvements. For a follow-up period of 37 months (median) we included 530 patients with at least one postoperative examination. 70 patients ended the follow-up prematurely - out of these 56 % quit the surveillance during the first 18 months. Another 68 patients died during the follow-up period. Cancer recurred in 28 % of the patients (n = 109 metastasis, n = 26 local recurrences, 18 patients developed a secondary cancer). 90 % of these recurrences occurred within the first three years. 3525 follow-up examinations took place within 79 months. Patient histories and physical examinations were not helpful for the diagnosis of local recurrences; neither were laboratory routine screenings meaningful. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19 - 9 tests, ultrasonographic studies, chest XD-rays and colonoscopic procedures had a higher diagnostic value on the other hand. We demonstrated the problematic nature of the evaluation of different follow-up tests concerning their validity as they were part of a complex postoperative surveillance program. It is also important to point out that the success of the postoperative surveillance depends strongly on the compliance of the patients. To increase this compliance we suggest that the follow-up of patients should be more strongly oriented towards the incidence of recurrences."

It is a promising tumor marker, since its excretion is frequently elevated in patients with various types of cancers. DiAcSpm was first detected and characterized by HPLC fractionation followed by enzymatic detection, but more recently, antibodies highly specific for DiAcSpm was prepared, and an ELISA system applicable to determination of urinary DiAcSpm was established. Measurement of urinary DiAcSpm using this ELISA system revealed that DiAcSpm is able to detect early stage (m and sm) colon cancers which CEA and CA19-9 cannot detect. DiAcSpm may also serve as a prognostic indicator and a marker for recurrence of colon cancer. Urinary DiAcSpm is elevated in metastatic and primary brain tumors including grade 3 and 4 gliomas and primary central nervous system lymphoma. In these primary brain tumors changes in urinary DiAcSpm were well correlated with the efficacy of treatments, recurrence of disease and increased malignancy of a tumor. DiAcSpm may be useful as a comprehensive indicator of the activeness of a brain tumor lesion in a patient. DiAcSpm was elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma, but patients with liver cirrhosis also showed considerably elevated levels of DiAcSpm."

Three hundred fourteen consecutive unselected patients undergoing curative surgery for colorectal cancer between 1996 and 1999 were studied with regard to asymptomatic curable recurrence, compliance with the program, and cost. Follow-up included carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) interval measurements, colonoscopy, ultrasonography of the liver, and radiography of the chest. In 194 (62%) of the patients, follow-up was conducted according to the Norwegian guidelines. Twenty-one patients (11%) were operated on for curable recurrence, and 18 patients (9%) were disease free after curative surgery for recurrence at evaluation. Four metachronous tumors (2%) were found. CEA interval measurement had to be made most frequently (534 tests needed) to detect one asymptomatic curable recurrence. Follow-up program did not influence cancer-specific survival. Overall compliance with the surveillance program was 66%, being lowest for colonoscopy (55%) and highest for ultrasonography of the liver (85%). The total program cost was 228,117 euro (US 280,994 dollars), translating into 20,530 euro (US 25,289 dollars) for one surviving patient after surgery for recurrence.

Whether the continuing implementation of such program and cost are justified should be debated."
CD011134,0,15742907,0,Care of cancer survivors.,"Cancer survivors are at increased risk for recurrence of their original malignancy; development of second primary malignancies; and medical, developmental, and psychologic problems resulting from cancer therapy, genetic predisposition to cancer, and other risk factors. Surveillance following curative cancer treatment generally includes interval history and physical examinations every six months for five years. Thereafter, histories and examinations are recommended annually for breast cancer; every three months for two years, then every six months for three to five years for colorectal cancer; and every six months for five years, then annually for prostate cancer. Recommended laboratory tests and ancillary procedures include annual mammography of preserved breast tissue in breast cancer survivors, carcinoembryonic antigen level monitoring in conjunction with annual colonoscopy in colorectal cancer patients, and prostate-specific antigen measurements every six months for five years and then annually in prostate cancer survivors. In addition, family physicians should be attentive to concerns about altered body image or sexuality issues following curative surgical procedures. Continued emphasis on preventive health practices is encouraged. Physicians should remain alert to nonspecific symptoms or physical findings (e.g., mass, adenopathy) that can indicate cancer recurrence. In childhood cancer survivors, periodic evaluation that includes a plan for surveillance and prevention, incorporating risks based on previous cancer, therapy, genetic predispositions, personal behaviors, and comorbid health conditions, is recommended."
CD011134,0,15685032,0,Postoperative computed tomography scan surveillance for patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer: worthy of further study?,"The use of computed tomography scan (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis for surveillance of colorectal cancer (CRC) after primary curative therapy (PCT) remains controversial. Surveillance guidelines at Roswell Park Cancer Institute have included annual CT for the first 2 years after PCT. Isolated metastases from CRC may be amenable to surgical resection, potentially leading to a survival advantage. To assess this, a retrospective chart review of all 203 patients diagnosed with stage II or III CRC between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1995, was conducted. First-year surveillance CT (CT-1) was performed for 146 of 203 patients and 81 of 146 patients had second-year surveillance CT (CT-2). CT was considered ""directed"" when at least 1 of the following prompted evaluation: suspicious symptoms or signs, rising carcinoembryonic antigen, findings from colonoscopies, chest x-rays, or laboratory tests. Otherwise, CT was considered ""nondirected."" Of 121 of 146 CT-1 and 63 of 81 CT-2 with nondirected CT, 7 of 121(5.8%) and 4 of 63 (6.4%) had proven recurrence, respectively. During 2 years of follow up, the estimated lower bound for detection of recurrence by nondirected CT was 11 of 121(9.1%). There were no apparent differences between the 2 groups in demographics, clinical presentation, surgical margins, treatment, tumor site, grade, or TNM stage. Surgical resectability of the metastases for directed and nondirected groups was 10 of 28 (36%) and 6 of 11 (54%), respectively. The median survival for the patients with recurrence in the directed and nondirected groups was 35 and 50 months, respectively. In conclusion, this retrospective study generates the hypothesis that CT surveillance may be of value. A prospective study, properly sized for power, is needed to answer this question."

We investigated the association of colorectal cancer with alterations in p53 DNA, protein and serum antibody levels to determine their prognostic value in colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer patients (n=167) who underwent surgery in Taipei Veterans General Hospital from January 1999 to December 2000 were enrolled [age 62.91+/-12.61 years (range: 22-85); 111 (66.5%) males]. Of these, 20 were stage I (12%), 54 stage II (32.3%), 58 stage III (34.7%), and 35 stage IV (21%). Median follow-up was 36.3 months (range: 4-58). p53 alteration was detected by DNA sequencing from exon 5 to 9 and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at two microsatellite markers near p53; and demonstrating intratumoral accumulation of p53 protein and detection of serum p53 antibodies using ELISA. p53 mutation frequency was 41.9% (70/167). Of 127 informative cases for LOH analysis, 73 (57.5%) tumors that had LOH had at least one microsatellite marker. Genetic p53 alterations were found for 56.3% of cases when LOH and DNA sequencing methods were combined. Genetic p53 alterations were associated with advanced tumor stage and tumor differentiation. Overexpression of intratumoral p53 and anti-p53 antibody positivity were 44.9% and 28.1%. The presence of p53-Ab was associated with p53 mutations (chi2 test, 42.9% vs. 17.5%, p=0.001), but not with overexpression of intratumoral p53 protein. The mutations at exon 6 (57.1%) and 7 (53.3%) were associated with presence of serum p53-Ab. Of 132 potentially cured patients, 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) was affected by: advanced TNM stage (I, II, III: 90%, 84%, and 41%), genetic p53 alteration (89% vs. 43%), intratumoral p53 accumulation (71% vs. 56%), and preoperative CEA level >5 ng/ml (74% vs. 58%). In multivariate analysis, genetic alteration of p53 was the most significant independent prognostic factor [hazard ratio (HR) = 6.09; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.45-15.11], followed by advanced tumor stage (HR = 3.93; 95% CI: 2.14-7.23), and preoperative CEA >5 ng/ml (HR = 1.98; 95% CI: 1.12-3.17).

FDG-PET is a non-invasive, functional imaging technique. FDG exploits the native glucose transporter to enter the cell. Since many tumours have enhanced glucose uptake, FDG is readily accumulated in malignant cells and can be detected by a PET camera. FDG-PET has been established as an important diagnostic tool in clinical oncology. This review deals with the current, well-established indications for FDG-PET scanning in patients with gastrointestinal cancers. In the current practice, FDG-PET is most commonly used to stage oesophageal carcinoma, to detect and stage recurrence of colorectal carcinoma and to differentiate between benign and malignant pancreatic lesions. The benefit of FDG-PET scanning in patients with oesophagus carcinoma is best established in stage IV disease, as the diagnostic accuracy to detect metastatic disease is higher compared to the combination of computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). In patients with a history of colorectal carcinoma, FDG-PET scanning is particularly effective in diagnosing recurrent disease, especially in those with a rising carcinoembryonic antigen without a suspect lesion on conventional imaging. Large series have indicated that the sensitivity and specificity for detecting recurrent colorectal carcinoma are in the range of 87%-100% and 66%-100%, respectively. Equally, FDG-PET has a high sensitivity (68%-96%) and specificity (78%-100%) in detecting pancreatic carcinoma in patients with a suspicious-looking pancreatic mass on CT scan. Lastly, we focus on the use of FDG-PET as a modality for early monitoring of treatment response in patients with gastrointestinal stromal cell tumours. Without doubt, future developments will further establish the diagnostic role of the FDG-PET scan in the care of patients with gastrointestinal cancers."

Since his CEA level rose in January 2001, computed tomography (CT) revealed a tumor in the abdomen. He underwent a resection of this tumor and disseminated tumors that were diagnosed during the operation. He received systemic chemotherapy (5'-DFUR 600 mg 3x everyday, CPT-11 80 mg/body div every 2 weeks), but the CEA level rose again in August 2003. He was diagnosed with spleen metastasis and underwent splenectomy. The tumor disseminated in the left diaphragm was also resected. After that, he received systemic chemotherapy (5-FU 500 mg/body/week div, levofolinate calcium 250 mg/body/week i.v.) as an outpatient. Peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer with distant metastasis, in general, has no indication for an operation.

Adjuvant chemotherapy was not performed because of stage I cancer. Nine months after the operation, solitary liver metastasis, and elevated CEA and CA19-9, were found during the postoperative work-up. A combination chemotherapy of CPT-11 and UFT-E was performed before scheduled liver resection. 150 mg/m2 of CPT-11 was administered on days 1 and 15. 375 mg/m2/day of UFT-E was divided in half and administered on days 3-7, 10-14, 17-21, and 24-28 as one course of treatment. This regimen was repeated every 5 weeks. The patient had a grade 2 diarrhea and nentropenia during the treatment. Bowel obstruction was also observed after 5 courses of treatment, which required hospitalization. In addition, the liver metastasis had disappeared. There was no evidence of recurrence after 8 months of chemotherapy. It was suggested that CPT-11+UFT-E combination chemotherapy was effective for advanced colorectal cancer."

CD011134,0,15366746,0,Cost-effectiveness of two follow-up strategies for curative resection of colorectal cancer: comparative study using a Markov model.,"The follow-up of patients with curative resection of colorectal cancer is still controversial. The means mobilized for postoperative monitoring come at a high cost. However, the modalities are neither formalized nor validated with regard to an improved 5-year survival rate. To compare the cost-effectiveness of both strategies for patient follow-up during the 7 years following curative resection of colorectal cancer, we performed a costeffectiveness analysis adjusted for quality of life. Using data from the literature and a population study, a simulation of follow-up on patients who had undergone curative resection of colorectal cancer was carried out over a 7-year period using a Markov model. Two Markov processes were modeled to compare the cost-effectiveness ratio adjusted for quality of life in patients with a follow-up in accordance with the recommendations of the 1998 French Consensus Conference (standard follow-up) with the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay and a simplified follow-up. The influence of standard follow-up on the quality-adjusted life expectancy of patients who had Duke's stage A and B colorectal cancer appears to be modest, with increases of 2.5 months and 1.3 months, respectively; it is more acceptable for patients who had had Duke's stage C, with an increase of 11 months. The high variability of cost-effectiveness ratios (> 7 years) of +/- 44,830 and 180,195 Euro per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), respectively) did not favor the standard follow-up. The cost-effectiveness ratio (> 7 years) of patients having had Duke's stage C colorectal cancer was 1,058 (sd: 2746) Euro per QALY and could favor the standard follow-up. This study showed that standard follow-up with CEA assay tended to preferentially improve the survival of Duke's stage C patients. The type of examination needed and the frequency with which it has to be carried out should take account of the stage, treatment for the initial illness, and the patient's age."

CD011134,0,15360055,0,Transient CEA increase at start of oxaliplatin combination therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.,"In general a rising carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level means tumor progression. We observed a transient increase in CEA level despite objective response among patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. This surge phenomenon has not previously been described for patients with metastatic colorectal disease. CEA was measured every second week in 27 patients receiving oxaliplatin, 5-fluororuracil, and folinic acid as first-line therapy against metastatic colorectal cancer. Four patients (15%, 95% CI 5-31%) met the criteria for therapy-induced CEA surge. The time of reaching maximum CEA level varied from 13 to 56 days. Median rise in CEA from baseline was 263% (range 24-632%). An initial rise of CEA during chemotherapy in colorectal cancer patients may therefore not always indicate progression of disease but may be a transient CEA surge in patients responding to chemotherapy."

CD011134,0,15333188,0,Evidence for the clinical use of tumour markers.,"Testing for tumour markers should only be performed if it results in a better patient outcome, increased quality of life or reduced overall cost of care. Ideally, the clinical value of a tumour marker should be validated in a large prospective study or a meta-analysis of small-scale retrospective/prospective studies (i.e. a level 1 evidence study) prior to routine use. Markers that have been validated in such a level 1 evidence study include carcinoembryonic antigen in the surveillance of patients with diagnosed colorectal cancer, alphafetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotrophin and lactate dehydrogenase for evaluating prognosis in patients non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, CA 125 for monitoring therapy in patients with ovarian cancer, oestrogen receptors for predicting response to hormone therapy in breast cancer, HER-2 for predicting response to trastuzumab in patients with advanced breast cancer and urokinase plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 for determining prognosis in breast cancer. Although currently in widespread use, the value of prostate-specific antigen in screening for prostate cancer has yet to be validated in a large prospective randomized trial."
CD011134,0,15332558,0,[Gastrointestinal cancer].,"Although their sensitivity is not high, SCC, TPA and IAP are useful for esophageal cancer. The sensitivity of CEA, CA 19-9, is relatively high, especially in well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis. AFP is specific to liver metastasis from gastric cancer, and CA 125 is also specific to peritoneal dissemination. CA 72-4 and NCC-ST-439 are useful markers for advanced staging. CEA, CA 19-9, is useful for colon cancer, especially for predicting preoperative staging. Half-life and doubling time of tumor markers is useful in some cases for the evaluation of operation and chemotherapy. We showed our data concerning postoperative CEA and/or CA 19-9 monitoring after operation for gastric cancer in 120 recurrent patients. Positivities of CEA and CA 19-9 for recurrence were 65.8% and 85.0%, respectively, both of which were significantly higher than the preoperative sensitivities (28.3% and 45.0%, respectively). In most patients with high levels of preoperative CEA and/or CA 19-9, these tumor markers increased again at recurrence. Recurrent diseases were detected between 5 months after detection by diagnostic imagings and 12 months before detection by diagnostic imagings (mean of 3.1+/-3.6 months before detection by diagnostic imagings) and between 10 months after detection by diagnostic imagings and 13 months before detection by diagnostic imagings (mean 2.2+/-3.9 months before detection by diagnostic imagings) by CEA and CA 19-9 monitorings, respectively. These results suggest that CEA and/or CA 19-9 monitoring after operation was useful to predict the recurrence of gastric cancer, especially in almost all the patients with high preoperative levels of these markers."

Pathological findings showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, s, n1. Two weeks after the surgery, 5'-DFUR was administered at 600 mg/day. An abdominal CT scan 2 months later demonstrated regression of the liver metastasis and another scan 4 months later showed the tumor had disappeared. 5'-DFUR was administered for about 2 years. Five years after the surgery, the patient is alive without recurrence and CEA level is in normal range."

The ideal marker would occur only in patients with malignancy, and would correlate with stage and response to treatment, however, to date there are few reliable prognostic markers in colorectal cancer (CRC), consequently much research is focused on identifying such markers. This review aims to summarise the most important currently available markers in CRC that provide prognostic or predictive information. Amongst others, it covers serum markers such as CEA and CA19-9, markers expressed in tumour tissue such as thymidylate synthase and also the expression/loss of expression of certain oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes such as K-ras and p53. The prognostic value of genomic instability, angiogenesis and proliferative indices such as apoptotic index is discussed."

The variable regions (V(L) and V(H)) assemble to form the antigen-combining sites, and the protein forms dimers through self-association of the C(H)3 domains. In animal models, the minibody demonstrated high tumor uptake, approaching that of some intact antibodies, substantially faster clearance than intact chimeric T84.66, and superior tumor-to-blood ratios compared with the cT84.66 F(ab')(2) fragment, making it attractive for further evaluation as an imaging and therapy agent.

A 65-year-old man complained of severe abdominal distension, abdominal pain and pulmonary failure, and was diagnosed as having ileus due to descending colon cancer. The patient underwent urgent open laparotomy to release the ileus condition on March 5, 2002. During the laparotomy, we established a diagnosis of nonresectable descending colon cancer accompanied by severe peritoneal dissemination and therefore performed only double-barreled transverse colostomy. The postoperative course was very good. Pathological examination of omental dissemination demonstrated moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and cytology of ascites was class II. The levels of serum CEA and CA19-9 were within the normal ranges. l-LV/5-FU therapy was initiated postoperatively. Seven cycles of this chemotherapy regimen was performed with no apparent side effect during the treatment. There was no postoperative accumulation of carcinomatous ascites. The patient gained 15 kg compared with body weight admission. On abdominal computed tomography (CT), the primary lesion of the colon decreased 98% and there was no ascites found. To date, there has not been any sign of recurrence during the 19 months of follow-up after this therapy, and we are currently discussing closure of the transverse colostomy. This therapy may be useful for patients with advanced colon cancer accompanied by peritoneal dissemination."
CD011134,0,15239990,1,Cost and effectiveness of follow-up examinations in patients with colorectal cancer resected for cure in a French population-based study.,"The cost of follow-up examinations for patients having undergone potentially curative surgery for colorectal cancer is considerable. The aim of this study was to provide a thorough assessment of the cost and effectiveness of the follow-up tests used during the 5 years after surgical resection for colorectal cancer and its recurrences. We studied medical and economic data from the records of 256 patients registered in the Herault Tumor Registry who underwent potentially curative surgical resection in 1992. Recurrence, curative recurrence, survival, and the cost of follow-up tests were assessed respectively for at least 5 years. We analyzed the cost and effectiveness of follow-up tests in patients who received either follow-up with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monitoring as advocated by the 1998 French consensus conference recommendations (standard follow-up) or a more minimal follow-up schedule. Nine patients died in the postoperative period. The 5-year survival rates in the standard and minimal follow-up groups were 85% and 79%, respectively (p=0.25). Cost-effectiveness ratios were 2123 in Dukes' stage A patients, 4306 in Dukes' stage B patients, and 9600 in Dukes' stage C patients. Cost-effectiveness ratios for CEA monitoring and abdominal ultrasonography per patient alive in the standard follow-up group were 1238 and 2261.5, respectively. Cost-effectiveness ratios for CEA monitoring and abdominal ultrasonography per patient alive in the minimal follow-up group were 1478 and 573, respectively. There were no survivors 5 years after a recurrence when the recurrence was detected by physical examination, chest X-ray, and colonoscopy in either follow-up group. Dukes' classification is a poor indicator of patient selection. The follow-up tests should only include CEA monitoring and abdominal ultrasonography for the diagnosis of recurrence."

Twenty-three patients had percutaneous RFA for 52 colorectal pulmonary metastases under fluoro-CT. Patients received IV conscious sedation and local analgesia with routine hospitalisation/monitoring for 24 h post RFA. Patients had CT scanning at 1 month and then 3 monthly with serum CEA assessment monthly and 3 monthly. All ablations were technically successful. Tumor diameter ranged from 0.3 to 4.2 cm. Pneumothorax occurred in 43% (10 of 23) of patients. Six patients required intercostal chest drain placement. Six patients had a second RFA, 4 for new lesions and 2 patients had a previously treated lesion retreated. Median admission was 2.0 days (range 1-9). Median follow-up is 428 days (range 173-829), with data reported to 1 year in this paper. Five patients died at 5, 6, 8, 8 and 12 months post RFA from extra-pulmonary (1) or widespread (4) disease. One patient developed malignant pleural effusion at 6 months after RFA. Cavitation was seen in nine treated lesions (17%), all resolved with scar tissue contraction by 12 months. Eighteen patients with CT scan follow-up at one year have 40 lesions classified as: disappeared (17), decreased (5), stable/same size (4), increased (14).

CD011134,0,15221968,0,Prognostic value of soluble P-selectin levels in colorectal cancer.,"Measurement of soluble (s) P-selectin levels has been proposed as a diagnostic tool for monitoring the clinical course of human neoplasms. Thus, our study was aimed at analyzing the role of sP-selectin in association with clinicopathological variables in 181 patients with primary (n =149) or metastatic (n = 32) colorectal cancer (CRC), 34 patients with benign diseases and 181 control subjects. The results obtained showed that sP-selectin levels were higher in patients with CRC compared either to patients with benign disease (p = 0.006) or controls (p = 0.003). No differences were observed between the latter and patients with benign diseases. Increased median sP-selectin levels were significantly associated with the presence of distant metastasis (68.2 ng/ml vs. 48.6 ng/ml, p = 0.002). Of interest, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were independently associated to sP-selectin (regression coefficient = 0.28, p < 0.002). Cox's proportional hazards survival analysis of primary CRC patients demonstrated that beside the stage of disease sP-selectin levels had an independent prognostic role in predicting recurrent disease (HR = 2.22, p = 0.019) and mortality from CRC (HR = 3.44, p= 0.017). These results suggest that measurement of plasma sP-selectin might represent a prognostic indicator in the management of patients with CRC."
CD011134,0,15202102,0,PET and PET-CT for evaluation of colorectal carcinoma.,"The evaluation of patients with known or suspected recurrent colorectal carcinoma is now an accepted indication for positron emission tomography using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) imaging. FDG-PET does not replace imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) for preoperative anatomic evaluation but is indicated as the initial test for diagnosis and staging of recurrence and for preoperative staging (N and M) of known recurrence that is considered to be resectable. FDG-PET imaging is valuable for the differentiation of posttreatment changes from recurrent tumor, differentiation of benign from malignant lesions (indeterminate lymph nodes, hepatic and pulmonary lesions), and the evaluation of patients with rising tumor markers in the absence of a known source. The addition of FDG-PET to the evaluation of these patients reduces overall treatment costs by accurately identifying patients who will and will not benefit from surgical procedures. Although initial staging at the time of diagnosis is often performed during colectomy, FDG-PET imaging is recommended for a subgroup of patients at high risk (with elevated CEA levels) and normal CT and for whom surgery can be avoided if FDG-PET shows metastases. Screening for recurrence in patients at high risk has also been advocated. FDG-PET imaging seems promising for monitoring patient response to therapy but larger studies are necessary. The diagnostic implications of integrated PET-CT imaging include improved detection of lesions on both the CT and FDG-PET images, better differentiation of physiologic from pathologic foci of metabolism, and better localization of the pathologic foci. This new powerful technology provides more accurate interpretation of both CT and FDG-PET images and therefore more optimal patient care. PET-CT fusion images affect the clinical management by guiding further procedures (biopsy, surgery, radiation therapy), excluding the need for additional procedures, and changing both inter- and intramodality therapy."

CD011134,0,15185002,0,"Molecular detection of APC, K- ras, and p53 mutations in the serum of colorectal cancer patients as circulating biomarkers.","Early detection of tumor DNA in serum/plasma prior to the development of recurrence or metastases could help improve the outcome of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) after tumor resection. Recent advances in the detection of tumor DNA in the serum/plasma has opened up numerous new areas for investigation and new possibilities for molecular diagnosis. APC and K- ras mutations are considered to be early-stage developments of CRCs, whereas p53 mutations are thought to be relatively late events in the tumorigenesis of CRCs. The aim of this study was to search for the presence of genetic mutations in the DNA extracted from the serum of CRC patients and healthy subjects. We simultaneously evaluate the significance of APC, K- ras, and p53 gene mutations in cancer tissues and their paired serum samples of 104 CRC patients by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP) followed by direct sequencing. Additionally, analysis was carried out to detect the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in CRC patients. Overall, we found at least one of the gene mutations in tumor tissues from 75% (78/104) of the CRC patients. Comparison of the three molecular markers showed that the detection rates in the serum were 30.4%, 34.0%, and 34.2% for APC, K- ras, and p53 genes, respectively. Of these patients, 46.2% (36/78) were identified as having positive serum results, whereas all healthy controls remained negative. The overall positive tumor DNA detection rates in the serum were 0% (0/7) for Dukes' A classification, 22.4% (11/49) for Dukes' B, 48.7% (19/39) for Dukes' C, and 66.7% (6/9) for Dukes' D. The detection rate increased as the tumor stage progressed ( p = 0.012). Concurrently, a significant difference was observed between lymph node metastases and positive serum tumor DNA detection ( p < 0.001). A significantly higher postoperative metastasis/recurrence rate in patients harboring gene mutations with serum tumor DNA than those without serum tumor DNA was also demonstrated ( p < 0.001). However, no significant correlation between the postoperative metastasis/recurrence and serum CEA levels was observed ( p = 0.247). These data suggest that the identification of circulating tumor DNA using the molecular detection of APC, K- ras, and p53 gene mutations is a potential tool for early detection of postoperative recurrence/metastases. Moreover, these genes may be potential molecular markers of poor clinical outcome in CRC patients."

Survival rates were calculated for more than 5 years after hepatic resection and timing of surgery and recurrences, maximum diameter and number of liver metastases, and intrahepatic recurrence were examined. There was no significant difference in survival rates for the type of liver resection (partial or anatomical) or preoperative serum CEA levels. As for the number of metastases, the 5-year survival rate was lower for patients with over 4 metastases than those with 1, 2, and 3 metastases (p < 0.034). A significant difference in survival rates was recognized for size of liver metastases (p = 0.0309) as follows: 54.6% 5-year survival rate for smaller than 4 cm and 43.8% for over 4 cm. Overall 5-year survival rate for the 410 patients was 50.1% after radical hepatectomy. Of the 410 patients, the 153 (37.3%) patients with intrahepatic recurrence had a 5-year survival rate of 27.3%. The 5-year survival rates for patients with a metastasis smaller than 4 cm, considered to reduce the influence in the difference between surgical procedure or indication for surgery, were verified to be from 88.2% to 11.9% in each institute. This suggests that there could be a difference in diagnostic accuracy, surgical indication or timing of surgery for synchronous liver metastases in each institute."
CD011134,0,15164599,0,[Clinical usefulness of urinary diacetylpolyamines as novel tumor markers].,"N1,N12-Diacetylspermine(DiAcSpm) and N1,N8-diacetylspermidine(DiAcSpd) are excreted in the urine of healthy persons as minor components of urinary polyamine, with small individual variations in amount. They are promising tumor markers, since their excretion is frequently elevated in patients with various types of cancers. DiAcSpm is sensitive in cancer detection, while DiAcSpd is highly specific for cancer. Diacetylpolyamines were initially characterized and determined by HPLC fractionation, followed by enzymatic detection. More recently, antibodies highly specific for DiAcSpm and DiAcSpd were developed, and an ELISA system applicable to the determination of urinary DiAcSpm was established. Measurement of urinary DiAcSpm using this ELISA system revealed that DiAcSpm is a more sensitive tumor marker than CEA, CA19-9 and CA15-3 for colon and breast cancers. More importantly, DiAcSpm efficiently detects patients at early stages. On the other hand, CEA, CA19-9 and CA15-3 are quite insensitive for early stage cancers. The urinary DiAcSpm level tends to remain low even in tumor-bearing individuals when their cancerous lesions remain static, while it rises rapidly concomitant with recurrence. DiAcSpm may serve as a prognostic indicator and marker for recurrence of prostate and colon cancers. Diacetylpolyamines may turn out to be general tumor markers, since active proliferation of any cancer tissues would likely be accompanied by activation of polyamine metabolism."

This is followed by the discussion of the latest aspects of patients' monitoring and continual follow-up with special emphasis on its clinical significance. In addition to CEA, the most important tumour marker in the present clinical practice, the authors review other tumour markers that might be used in controlling cancer treatment and patients' status. The estimation of treatment effectiveness should be combined with tumour marker level determinations at regular intervals because they are capable of demonstrating the dynamics of malignant processes and, if applied in adequate combinations, indicate the presence of a recurrence or metastasis. The integration of a ""tumour marker panel"" into the practice of follow-up may help early cancer detection and reduce health care expenses."
CD011134,0,15077925,0,Clinical significance of preoperative serum sialic acid levels in colorectal cancer: utility in the detection of patients at high risk of tumor recurrence.,"This study was conducted to evaluate the significance of preoperative serum sialic acid levels in the diagnosis and prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Total sialic acid (TSA) was determined by the thiobarbituric acid method and normalized to total protein (TP). A postoperative follow-up of CRC patients classified as Dukes' stages A, B or C was performed and survival analysis was carried out to evaluate the impact of sialic acid levels on tumor recurrence. Our diagnostic studies indicate that TSA/TP is a better marker than either TSA or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), especially for the detection of CRC patients at an early stage. At a cutoff of 30.90 nmol/mg of protein, TSA/TP showed a sensitivity of 85% with a specificity of 97% to discriminate CRC patients from healthy donors. In survival analysis, both TSA and TSA/TP were found to be significant prognostic factors for tumor recurrence in CRC. Furthermore, TSA/TP could distinguish patients at high risk of recurrence within Dukes' stage B and in multivariate analysis it was identified as the best independent prognostic factor. According to our results, preoperative serum TSA/TP content could supply additional information to that provided by Dukes' stage about the prognosis of CRC patients."
CD011134,0,15063889,0,The extent of resection influences outcome following hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases.,"The acceptable indications for liver resection in patients with colorectal metastases have increased significantly in the last decade. It is thus becoming more difficult to ascertain the limitations for selection as the boundaries have been greatly extended. This has resulted in not only more extensive resections, but more atypical and bilobar resections. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of patients undergoing different extent of liver resection in a specialist unit."
CD011134,0,15059021,0,"Cryotherapy for liver tumors: current status, perspectives, clinical results, and review of literature.","Cryotherapy has gained importance as a locally ablative treatment option for patients with non-resectable liver tumors, especially metastases from colorectal cancer. We have used this technique since 1996 for the treatment of 77 patients with malignant liver tumors. Patient data was prospectively recorded and follow-up was until September 2002 or death. Fifty-five patients had colorectal cancer liver metastases, 16 metastases from other primaries and 6 had hepatoma. Forty patients had cryotherapy only and 37 had an additional liver resection. Morbidity and mortality were 22% and 1.3%, respectively. In 68% of patients with colorectal liver metastases and an elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen-level preoperatively, it returned to the normal range following cryosurgery. For all 77 patients, median survival was 28 months with a 3- and 5-year-survival rate of 39% and 26%, respectively, and median survival was 29 months with a 3- and 5-year-survival rate of 44% and 26%, respectively, for the 55 patients with colorectal liver metastases. Local recurrence at the cryosite was observed in 13 of 65 patients (20%) with initially complete treatment. For cryotherapy to further establish as a treatment for malignant liver tumors in a time where many new local ablative techniques are developing, different goals need to be achieved. The trauma of the procedure and local treatment failure need to be minimized and survival results need to be optimized. Published studies and new possible fields of research regarding these goals are discussed."
CD011134,0,15043338,0,Jaundice secondary to isolated porta hepatis metastasis in colorectal cancer: case report and review of the literature.,"Colorectal cancer occurs mainly after the age of 50. The liver is the most frequent site of metastases, although isolated metastases to the porta hepatis are rarely reported in the literature. From 1924 to 1993, only 16 cases of periportal lymph nodes metastases were reported. We report a case of jaundice secondary to porta hepatis metastases from primary colorectal cancer. The appearance of symptoms was concurrent with the elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen in our case. This emphasizes the importance of polymerase chain reaction to detect the small amount of carcinoembryonic antigen transcript in blood or in peritoneal fluid before the appearance of symptoms. Polymerase chain reaction allows the prediction of high risk of recurrence and the presence of micrometastases. More trials are needed to assess the outcome after treatment by adjuvant chemotherapy for micrometastases."
CD011134,0,15043294,0,Does serum CA19-9 play a practical role in the management of patients with colorectal cancer?,"CA19-9 is often used in combination with carcinoembryonic antigen to manage patients with colorectal cancer, even though there is insufficient evidence to support this use of CA19-9. Carcinoembryonic antigen, by contrast, has been regarded as a better indicator of poor prognosis and recurrence. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether CA19-9 is, in fact, a useful marker in the management of colorectal cancer patients by comparing it with carcinoembryonic antigen."
CD011134,0,15037935,0,Detection of occult metastasis in lymph nodes from colorectal cancer patients: a multiple-marker reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction study.,"Lymph node status is a key factor for disease staging and is the main determinant for adjuvant therapy of colorectal cancer. The current staging procedure is unable to identify occult metastasis in lymph nodes, which is likely to be an important cause of treatment failure in some early-stage patients. The detection of occult metastasis could identify a patient subgroup at risk for disease relapse that would benefit from adjuvant therapy. The purpose of this study was to establish and test a multimarker reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay for the molecular detection of occult metastases in lymph nodes."
CD011134,0,15028309,0,Follow-up of patients treated by cytoreduction and chemotherapy for peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin.,"The aim of this study was to determine the value of medical history and physical examination, tumour marker testing, and CT-scanning in the follow-up of patients treated for peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin."
CD011134,0,15028308,0,The clinicopathological significance of inferior mesenteric lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer.,There are few studies reporting survival or recurrence patterns in colorectal cancer patients with inferior mesenteric lymph node metastasis (IMLN+). The present study evaluated the prognostic significance of patients being IMLN+ or IMLN- in colorectal cancer.
CD011134,0,15012886,0,[Serum vascular endothelial growth factor levels in patients with colorectal cancer and its prognostic significance].,Thirty per cent of patients with histologically node-negative colorectal cancer die from disseminated disease. Actually disease stage is the most useful prognostic parameter although it is not sufficient. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic cytokine involved in the progression of tumors. In our study we tried to know the prognostic significance of pre and postoperative serum VEGF levels in patients with colorectal cancer.
CD011134,0,15011851,0,Distributions in CEA doubling time differ in patients with recurrent colorectal carcinomas.,Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is often measured during follow-up of patients surgically treated for colorectal cancer. We determined characteristic findings in serum CEA concentrations or CEA doubling time (DT) depending on the different tumor distributions in colorectal cancer patients.
CD011134,0,15007086,0,The value of routine serum carcino-embryonic antigen measurement and computed tomography in the surveillance of patients after adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.,"This analysis aims to evaluate routine carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) and computed tomography (CT) of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis as part of protocol-specified follow-up policy for colorectal cancer (CRC)."

CD011134,0,14991634,0,Predictors of extrahepatic recurrence after resection of colorectal liver metastases.,"It is important to identify patients at high risk of extrahepatic recurrence after surgery for liver metastases, in order to maximize the survival benefit obtained by prophylactic regional chemotherapy."
CD011134,0,14716495,0,Prognostic evaluation and review of immunohistochemically detected disseminated tumor cells in peritumoral lymph nodes of patients with pN0 colorectal cancer.,The value of immunohistochemical detection of disseminated tumor cells in histopathologically tumor-free lymph nodes (pN0) of patients with colorectal cancer is still of uncertain prognostic value. We therefore evaluated the immunohistochemical detection rates and their prognostic value comparing three different monoclonal antibodies.
CD011134,0,14648708,0,"Quantification of cytokeratin 20, carcinoembryonic antigen and guanylyl cyclase C mRNA levels in lymph nodes may not predict treatment failure in colorectal cancer patients.","Conventional histopathologic staging of primary colorectal cancers does not allow accurate prognostic stratification within a given tumour stage. Therefore, PCR-based assays are increasingly used to try to predict more accurately the likelihood of disease progression for the individual patient. Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays were used to detect and quantitate cytokeratin 20 (ck20), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) mRNA in 149 lymph nodes (LN) from 17 patients with benign disease and 302 LN from 42 patients with colorectal cancer who had curative (R0) resections. None of the markers were specific, with ck20, CEA and GCC mRNA detected in 47%, 89% and 13% of 149 LN, respectively, from patients with benign disease. The sensitivity of all 3 markers was very high, with mRNA detected in 93%, 100% and 97% of 30 histologically involved LN, respectively. There was significant overlap in the mRNA levels of all 3 markers between histologically involved and uninvolved LN. There was no association between mRNA levels and distant recurrence (median follow-up: 3.94 years, range 3.35-5.12). We conclude that the use of molecular techniques to detect occult disease in LN may suffer from the same limitations as conventional methods. Instead, accurate prognostic stratification requires careful assessment of the likely metastatic potential of the primary cancer."
CD011134,0,19764149,0,Colon cancer. Clinical practice guidelines in oncology.,"The NCCN Colon/Rectal/Anal Cancers Guidelines panel believes that a multidisciplinary approach is necessary for managing colorectal cancer. The panel endorses the concept that treating patients in a clinical trial has priority over standard or accepted therapy. The recommended surgical procedure for resectable colon cancer is an en bloc resection. For patients with stage III disease, 5-FU-based adjuvant therapy is recommended. A patient who has metastatic disease in the liver or lung should be considered for surgical resection if he or she is a candidate for surgery and if surgery can extend survival. Surgery should be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The panel advocates a conservative post-treatment surveillance program for colon carcinoma patients. Serial CEA determinations are appropriate if the patient is a candidate for aggressive surgical resection should recurrence be detected. Abdominal and pelvic CT scans should be used only when there are clinical indications of possible recurrence. Patients whose disease progresses during 5-FU-based therapy should be treated with bolus irinotecan. Patients who progress on irinotecan are candidates for 5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin therapy or should be encouraged to participate in a phase I or phase II clinical trial."
CD011134,0,15244179,0,Thermic ablation with RF of liver metastases from colorectal cancer.,"Aim of this study was to evaluate the role of radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of the hepatic metastasis of colorectal cancer. From November 1997 to July 2002 49 radiofrequency ablations have been performed in 19 patients (11 male and 8 female; mean age 65 years: range 50-78 years). The disease-free period was between 5 and 32 months. Nodules had a diameter <3 cm in 4 cases while in 3 cases a single lesion was present. One patient had a single lesion after 2 courses of intravenous systemic chemotherapy which had a reduced greater lesion (from 6 to 3 cm) while a 2 cm lesion had disappeared. In the remaining 12 patients the mean number of lesions is 3 (range 1-13) with a diameter between 3 and 12 cm. The radiofrequency ablation has been performed during laparotomy and vascular exclusion through clampage of the liver hilum in 4 cases and percutaneously under ultrasound guide in the remaining 15 cases. All patients underwent follow up by computed tomography, CEA level and ultrasound every 3 months. One patient only has completed a 4 year follow up and is alive without local recurrence but with a cerebral metastasis. The other 18 patients have a 32 months follow up with a survival of 50% (9 on 18). In conclusion in our experience the radiofrequency ablation is a valid alternative method in the treatment of the hepatic metastasis of colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,14968942,0,Follow-up after colorectal cancer surgery.,"Although most institutions offer some kind of follow-up to patients operated on for colorectal cancer, its value with respect to prolonged survival has been challenged. However, improved results of liver surgery and chemotherapy make it reasonable to assume that a follow-up programme leading to detection of more asymptomatic recurrences would result in improved survival. Liver metastases and extramural local recurrences are the most common secondary lesions and 5-year survival rates of about 30% are reported after radical resection. From these observations a survival benefit could be expected when follow-up is directed to these forms of recurrence. From six randomized studies, six comparative cohort studies and four meta-analyses it can be concluded that an intensive follow-up programme results in more recurrences being resected for cure and about a 10% higher 5-year survival rate compared with less intensive or no follow-up. However, the differences in the follow-up protocols make it difficult to conclude how a follow-up programme should be designed. Liver imaging and carcinoembryonic antigen assay should probably be included, while the yield of frequent colonoscopies is small. A follow-up regimen based on these principles is suggested. Future studies should focus on which tests are the most cost-effective for follow-up after colorectal cancer resection."
CD011134,0,14756546,0,Serum tumor markers may precede instrumental response to chemotherapy in patients with metastatic cancer.,"Although serum tumor markers (STMs) are widely used in clinical practice, their predictive role for the response to anticancer treatment is still controversial. The correlation of CEA, CA 15.3, CA 19.9, CA 125 (only with peritoneal involvement) and NSE levels with imaging response and clinical benefit was investigated in 60 non-selected patients with metastatic epithelial cancers treated by single-agent docetaxel chemotherapy."

CD011134,0,14696436,0,Radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer.,"The aim was to assess the response to the treatment using thermal radiofrequency ablation in patients with pelvic recurrent rectal cancer. The location of the lesions as well as the placement of the percutaneous probe were guided by computed tomography. All ablations were performed with a RITA Medical Systems Starburst XL (nine-array, 5-cm) thermal ablation catheter and the Model 1500 generator (RITA Medical Systems, Inc.). The radiofrequency ablation treatment was performed in two patients with pelvic recurrent rectal cancer with poor response to chemoradiotherapy with no indication of new surgical treatment and suffering strong pain in the sacrum area. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen had a sharp reduction in a sixty-day period. The post-procedure tomography analysis showed the center of the tumor with necrosis and a ring of edema around it. Both patients had no complaints about the procedure, and they needed to take mild analgesics only on the first day right after the procedure for pain. In the follow-up one patient developed an abscess and needed to be readmitted but without recurrent pelvic pain. An effective response was shown by tumor necrosis and total relief of pain of the sacrum area."
CD011134,0,14676105,0,A Phase I trial of 90Y-anti-carcinoembryonic antigen chimeric T84.66 radioimmunotherapy with 5-fluorouracil in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.,"Targeted systemic radiation therapy using radiolabeled antibodies results in tumor doses sufficient to produce significant objective responses in the radiosensitive hematological malignancies. Although comparable doses to tumor are achieved with radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in solid tumors, results have been modest primarily because of their relative lack of radiosensitivity. For solid tumors, as with external beam radiotherapy, RIT should have a more important clinical role if combined with other systemic, potentially radiation-enhancing chemotherapy agents and if used as consolidative therapy in the minimal tumor burden setting. The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the feasibility and toxicities of systemic 90Y-chimeric T84.66 (cT84.66) anti-carcinoembryonic antigen RIT in combination with continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)."
CD011134,0,14668591,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen mRNA in the mesenteric vein is not a predictor of hepatic metastasis in patients with resectable colorectal cancer: a long-term study.,The clinical value of carcinoembryonic antigen messenger ribonucleic acid in the draining venous blood has been controversial because of short observation period. The authors prospectively investigated the clinical significance of detection of carcinoembryonic antigen messenger ribonucleic acid in the draining venous blood to predict hepatic metastases in patients with resectable colorectal cancer.
CD011134,0,14598428,0,Prognostic factors in resection of pulmonary metastasis from colorectal cancer.,The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate characteristics of primary colorectal cancer and pulmonary metastases in order to identify prognostic factors for overall survival and risk factors for further intrapulmonary recurrence after resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer.
CD011134,0,14594539,0,Liver resection for colorectal metastases.,"Colorectal cancer is the second commonest malignancy in the UK. Metastases to the liver occur in greater than 50% of patients and remain the biggest determinant of outcome in these patients. Liver resection is a safe procedure that achieves good long-term survival, but surgery has traditionally been limited to select groups of patients. The improved outcome suggests that more patients could benefit from resection if more was known of what criteria are predictive of a good outcome."
CD011134,0,14585038,0,[Prognostic significance and clinic utility of serum and immunohistochemical cathepsin B levels in colorectal cancer].,Aproximately one third of node-negative colorectal cancer recur suggesting the presence of micrometastasis not detected by conventional histopathologic methods. We think that the role of enzymes like Cathepsin B play in the process of invasion and metastasis in colorectal cancer might identify at earlier stages patients with high risk of shorter survival and who need more aggressive treatment. Our porpuse is to evaluate the prognostic significance of preoperative serum and inmunohistochemical levels of cathepsin B to identify colorectal carcinomas with worse prognostic.
CD011134,0,14581354,0,Automated analysis of multiple sections for the detection of occult cells in lymph nodes.,"At present, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR against carcino-embryonic antigen mRNA is one of the few research tools for the detection of occult cells in histopathologically assessed negative lymph nodes from patients with colorectal cancer.

CD011134,0,14524394,0,Serum tumor markers.,"Monoclonal antibodies are used to detect serum antigens associated with specific malignancies. These tumor markers are most useful for monitoring response to therapy and detecting early relapse. With the exception of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), tumor markers do not have sufficient sensitivity or specificity for use in screening. Cancer antigen (CA) 27.29 most frequently is used to follow response to therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Carcinoembryonic antigen is used to detect relapse of colorectal cancer, and CA 19-9 may be helpful in establishing the nature of pancreatic masses. CA 125 is useful for evaluating pelvic masses in postmenopausal women, monitoring response to therapy in women with ovarian cancer, and detecting recurrence of this malignancy. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, sometimes is used to screen highly selected populations and to assess hepatic masses in patients at particular risk for developing hepatic malignancy. Testing for the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) is an integral part of the diagnosis and management of gestational trophoblastic disease. Combined AFP and beta-hCG testing is an essential adjunct in the evaluation and treatment of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors, and in monitoring the response to therapy. AFP and beta-hCG also may be useful in evaluating potential origins of poorly differentiated metastatic cancer. PSA is used to screen for prostate cancer, detect recurrence of the malignancy, and evaluate specific syndromes of adenocarcinoma of unknown primary."
CD011134,0,14521450,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen elevation due to bowel sequestration with mucocele formation following colonic resection.,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is recommended as a serologic marker to monitor colorectal carcinoma recurrence. Elevations of CEA due to causes other than carcinoma exist and may lead to a misdiagnosis of recurrent carcinoma. We report a case of bowel sequestration with mucocele formation at the site of previous colo-colic anastomosis causing a mild elevation in CEA. The patient exhibited increasing CEA levels 6 years after resection of a sigmoid colon carcinoma with end-to-end anastomosis. Subsequently, computed tomographic and positron emission tomographic scans documented the presence of a cystic mass showing increased uptake at the anastomotic site. At exploratory laparotomy a mass lesion with mucus-filled protrusions was resected. Pathologic examination documented the presence of sequestration of a segment of the bowel wall with a mucocele and no overlying defect at the mucosal anastomotic site by demonstrating the presence of all bowel layers. After resection of the lesion, the CEA level normalized."
CD011134,0,14507003,0,Carcinosarcoma of the rectosigmoid colon: report of a case.,"We report an unusual case of carcinosarcoma of the colon. An 80-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with lower abdominal pain. Computed tomography showed a large pelvic mass, 18cm in maximal diameter, and barium enema and colonoscopy both showed a type-2 tumor in the sigmoid colon. We performed Hartmann's procedure with resection of the ileocolic segment. Immunohistochemical stains of the resected specimen revealed that most of the tumor consisted of spindle cell sarcoma with neural and muscle differentiation, while only the superficial area of an ulcerated lesion contained adenocarcinoma positive for carcinoembryonic antigen. The patient died of a fast-growing recurrent pelvic tumor 6 months postoperatively. Our experience of this case and our review of eight other cases in the English literature indicate that wide resection provides the best chance of cure, but careful postoperative follow-up is essential."

We performed a phase I study of patients with advanced carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-expressing malignancies followed by a phase II study of patients with resected hepatic metastases of colon cancer to assess safety and feasibility of administering autologous DC loaded with CEA mRNA. The immunizations were well tolerated. Of the 24 evaluable patients in the dose-escalation phase, there was 1 complete response (by tumor marker), 2 minor responses, 3 with stable disease, and 18 with progressive disease. In the phase II study, 9 of 13 patients have relapsed at a median of 122 days. Evidence of an immunologic response was demonstrated in biopsies of DC injection sites and peripheral blood of selected patients.

The goal of any surveillance program should be detection of recurrent disease at a sufficiently early time to allow subsequent curative therapy. Although periodic clinical examinations, laboratory tests, radiographic imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing have been utilized as a form of surveillance, such aggressive and costly intervention has not been validated through clinical studies. Four of the five randomized trials comparing such an intensive surveillance strategy to less frequent testing have not demonstrated the intensive approach to lead to an improvement in overall survival. Furthermore, intensive testing is both costly and has been shown not to improve quality of life. Further research designing appropriate postoperative testing is needed to guide physicians and patients after the curative resection of a colorectal cancer."

Wide variation of follow up and diagnostic routines].,"There are still no large controlled studies that have proved any survival benefit with intensive follow-up after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. There is a wide variation in follow-up. Three meta-analysis have shown that intensive follow-up can improve survival, the most recent based on five previously published small controlled trials that compared intensive with control follow-up. Since the randomised studies were initiated, there have been a strong development of rectal cancer surgery and surgery for livermetastasis as well as for adjuvant and palliative oncologic treatments. This development gives support to a more active attitude towards intensive regular follow-up. An active follow-up should be selective and only include patients who tolerate oncologic or surgical treatment. Diagnostic tests to find intraluminal recurrence are ineffective. Large multicenter studies are still warranted."
CD011134,0,12738742,0,Vaccine therapy of established tumors in the absence of autoimmunity.,"Many current clinical trials involve vaccination of patients with vaccines directed against tumor-associated antigens, which are, in actuality, ""self-antigens"" overexpressed in tumors as compared with normal tissues. As tumor vaccines become more potent through the addition of costimulatory molecules and cytokines and the use of diversified prime and boost regimes, the level of concern rises regarding the balance between antitumor immunity and pathological autoimmunity. Studies were conducted using mice bearing a transgenic self-antigen [human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)], which is expressed in some normal adult tissues, and tumor expressing the same self-antigen. These mice were vaccinated with recombinant poxviral vectors [recombinant vaccinia, recombinant fowlpox (rF)] encoding the CEA transgene as well as a triad of costimulatory molecules [B7-1, ICAM-1, and LFA-3 (TRICOM)]. Here we investigate the mechanism of tumor therapy and evaluate the safety of such a regimen in a self-antigen system. To our knowledge, the study reported here is the first description of a vaccine to a defined antigen where the regimen is potent enough to induce tumor therapy in the absence of autoimmunity."

Thirty-five patients, surgically treated for colorectal cancer, underwent a follow-up program that included physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen serum assay, conventional colonoscopy, liver ultrasonography, and chest X-ray. For these patients, we added a yearly contrast-enhanced CT colonography. All CT examinations were performed with a high-resolution protocol using a multidetector spiral CT scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) prior to and after the administration of 130 ml of i.v. contrast material. Images were directly analyzed on a dedicated workstation by two radiologists to determine colonic evaluation, visualization of colonic anastomosis, presence of polyps, and extra-colonic findings. Colonic evaluation was judged as optimal in 91.7% of all colonic segments. All mechanical surgical anastomoses were visualized with CT colonography. There was no evidence of anastomotic recurrence. Seven polyps were detected in five different patients with CT colonography, with two false-positive and no false-negative examinations. Three liver metastases and two basal pulmonary nodules were also identified. Contrast-enhanced CT colonography is a feasible alternative to both conventional colonoscopy and liver ultrasonography in the follow-up of patients operated on for colorectal cancer."

Since then, surgical resection of pulmonary metastases has been generally accepted as a standard therapeutic procedure in properly selected cases. Recently, the criteria of eligibility have been progressively expanded according to the development of radiological diagnosis using helical computed tomography (CT), widespread of minimum invasive video-assisted thoracic surgery. In this review summarized the surgical treatment of pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer based on the recent literatures. Major areas of controversy remain with respect to the following aspects: prognostic factors (i.e., number of metastases, size of tumor, disease free interval, preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen level), procedure of operation (i.e., role of video-assisted thoracic surgery, lymphonode dissection), indication of surgical treatment on metastases both lung and liver, role of repeat thoracotomy for recurrence. For all above-mentioned points it appeared reasonable to try to the cooperative multicentric clinical prospective study."

CD011134,0,12636102,0,Detection of peritoneal micrometastases by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction targeting carcinoembryonic antigen and cytokeratin 20 in colon cancer patients.,"Peritoneal recurrence after curative resection of malignant tumor with negative cytology is considered to be caused by microscopic dissemination of the exfoliated cancer cells from primary tumors to serosal surfaces at the time of operation, not detectable with conventional diagnostic tools. We applied the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 20 (CK 20) to detect micrometastatic foci in the peritoneal cavity of colon cancer patients. Cytological samples taken by peritoneal lavage from a series of 79 colon cancer patients were analyzed microscopically, for CEA levels, and by RT-PCR analysis using nested primers for CEA and CK 20. Cases with both CEA and CK 20 signals were defined as PCR-positive. This RT-PCR method proved both sensitive (1 tumor cell/10(6) non-tumor cells on preparation of serial colorectal cancer cell dilutions) and specific (no false positive results, 0/23 tested in our control experiment). Intraperitoneal micrometastatic cells were detected in peritoneal lavage 7.6% by cytology, 17.7% by CEA levels, and 24.1% by RT-PCR (significantly higher than by cytology: p=0.0046). RT-PCR detection rate increased in parallel with pathological depth of tumor invasion, and also a pathological stage-dependence was suggested according to the tumor-node-metastasis classification of the International Union Against Cancer. Our results suggest that CEA and CK 20 mRNA identification by RT-PCR appeared to be reliable and may be useful for early diagnosis in peritoneal dissemination of colon cancer."

We investigated the therapeutic and adverse drug reaction of intensive chemotherapy using cisplatin (CDDP), 5-FU and dl-leucovorin (LV) (PFL-therapy), which may be producing dual biochemical modulation effect of 5-FU for advanced colorectal carcinoma. Administration schedule was 13 mg/m2 of CDDP, 300 mg/m2 of 5-FU, and 30 mg/body of dl-LV for 5 consecutive days. This regimen was repeated at 3-week intervals in hospital. Sixteen patients were enrolled in this study, most of whom had a history of previous chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment, and the response rate was 25%, with four patients having ""partial response"" and eight ""no change"". In respect to performance status, 46% of patients who completed the protocol were markedly improved in spite of their poor performance status before treatment. Moreover, when patients were classified into two groups based on changes of the serum level of CEA, ""responder in CEA level"" showed better prognosis than ""non-responder in CEA level"". Major toxicities were nausea, hyperglycemia and neutropenia. Three patients experienced Grade 4 hematological side effect, but these complications resolved quickly in all patients except for one patient. PFL-therapy is effective for advanced colorectal cancer with large tumor burden and showed the same prognostic result as the American and European trials in spite of smaller number of treatment cycles and a history of previous chemotherapy. We will be able to demonstrate the usefulness of this regimen for Japanese patients with advanced colorectal cancers after adding new cases to the present report."

Initial CEA was 67.0 ng/mL and tumor volume 93 cm3 with no metastasis outside the pelvis. A total of 333 seeds of Iodine-125 were delivered to the entire target, with dosage of 150 to 200 Gy as calculated by post-implant CT dosimetry with Varian MMS software.

CD011134,0,12590703,0,Human colon adenocarcinoma in the SCID/CB6 radiation chimera is susceptible to adoptive transfer of allogeneic human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.,"The aim of this study was to develop a murine model of human colon carcinoma (hCC) and to ascertain the potential of cellular immunotherapy in this model. Fragments of hCC obtained at surgery from 6 patients were transplanted under the kidney capsule of lethally irradiated CB6 mice radioprotected with severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice bone marrow. Tumor xenografts conserved their malignant behavior in the new environment, invading the mouse kidney parenchyma and expanding into the peritoneal cavity and adjacent tissues. Their growth was typically exponential, and they expanded to dimensions that allowed their subsequent fragmentation and passage to further preconditioned mice. Human carcinoembryonic antigen (hCEA) was detected on the implanted tumor and at occasionally spontaneous lung metastases. Most significantly, high levels of this tumor marker were detected in the sera of tumor-bearing mice, providing a useful tool, which allowed long-term experiments, monitoring of tumor progression, and its response to some treatment modalities. For instance, complete resection of the transplanted tumors, by means of nephrectomy, resulted in the disappearance of hCEA from mice sera within 2 weeks. Similarly, adoptive transfer of allogeneic human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) into the peritoneum of tumor-bearing mice, resulted in their rapid engraftment, infiltration of tumor mass, and a significant drop of hCEA levels in mice serum, accounting for inhibition of tumor growth. We suggest that this novel model of human colon carcinoma affords the opportunity for in vivo evaluation of different preclinical treatment modalities, particularly, those involving manipulation with immune effector cells."

In RO resections according to UICC classification, the local relapses were classified as the most important factor for survival. Without any doubts the most important of these tumor-biological prognostic factors in patients with colorectal carcinoma is the carcino-embryonal antigen. Up to now, the unquestionable importance of the determination of serum levels of CEA for the detection of relapses is most often described."
CD011134,0,12543084,0,"Prognostic role of serum vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor and nitric oxide in patients with colorectal carcinoma.","Recently, angiogenesis has gained an increasing interest as a prognostic factor in a variety of solid tumours. In this study we aimed to assess the prognostic role of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) and nitric oxide (NO) levels in patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC).A total of 52 consecutive colorectal cancer patients with stage I to IV disease was included. In addition to routine laboratory and staging procedures, serum VEGF, b-FGF levels, and nitrate levels as a surrogate marker for in-vivo NO production were assayed. Serum VEGF concentrations, adjusted to the platelet count were found to be a significant factor for overall survival in univariate analysis (P=0.033). A new angiogenic index (AI), derived from serum VEGF and nitrate concentrations, was established. AI is the only independent prognostic factor of survival in all patients (P=0.008, Cox regression analysis). Likewise, AI is also significant prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with operable CRC (P=0.032, Cox regression analysis). In conclusion, serum VEGF and NO levels have prognostic role in patients with CRC and the new angiogenesis index using the serum levels of the factors seem to be useful."
CD011134,0,12507211,0,The preoperative assessment and postoperative surveillance of patients with colon and rectal cancer.,"Many advances have been made in the field of colorectal cancer follow-up since the pioneering efforts of Wangensteen and others with second-look operations in the 1950s. The understanding of the biology and natural history of colorectal malignancy has been advanced. Diagnostic methods for detection of recurrent disease have also advanced tremendously with CEA monitoring, immunoscintigraphy. CT, MRI, and PET imaging. As has been discussed in this article, however, no strategy of postoperative follow-up has been shown unequivocally to produce improved survival benefit or cure rate. It is quite possible that benefit will be shown, but well-controlled trials will be required. Cost considerations will likely prove important, because the rate of detection of curable disease will likely.be low. Quality of life issues will also be important in such trials. Better treatment and outcome ol recurrent disease would provide a strong rationale for vigorous postoperative surveillance. New recommendations are currently evolving [54]. Early diagnosis seems likely to enhance the curability of both local and distant relapses and second primary tumors. Furthermore, there may be a survival and quality of life advantage that results from the early institution of chemotherapy, even for those tumors found to be inoperable [55]. In devising a plan for follow-up in patients, it is important to recognize the anatomic and temporal patterns of recurrence as well as their relationships to the initial tumor staging. Although there is little proof that the identification of recurrent disease in follow-up programs increases the likelihood of resectability, cure, or prolonged survival, many physicians have witnessed successful treatment of recurrent colorectal cancer. These anecdotal experiences, the unproven belief that follow-up is beneficial, and traditions imparted during training are among the likely motivating factors for most physicians caring for colorectal cancer patients."
CD011134,0,12496545,0,"Laparoscopic placement of hepatic artery catheter for regional chemotherapy infusion: technique, benefits, and complications.","Approximately 15% to 18% of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancers present with metastases confined to the liver. Although many may undergo a liver resection procedure, some will not be candidates for surgery or will have recurrence of liver disease within the first 2 years after liver metastasis resection. For this subset of patients, regional hepatic chemotherapy, including intra-arterial chemotherapy, has been shown to improve control of the disease and, in some cases, prolong survival. With the advent of laparoscopic surgery and its application to more and more advanced procedures, the possibility of laparoscopic placement of a chemotherapy infusion catheter in the hepatic artery with all the advantages of a minimally invasive approach appears to be a viable alternative in our hands. From November 1993 through February 2002, 20 patients (12 male, 8 female) successfully underwent laparoscopic placement of a hepatic artery infusion catheter at the Texas Endosurgery Institute. Correct placement of the catheter was confirmed by methylene blue injections via the hepatic artery catheter at the time of surgery. Chemotherapy was generally initiated in the immediate postoperative period. Mean age was 68.3 years (range, 46-82). Twelve of the patients (60%) had previously undergone abdominal surgery. There were 27 major laparoscopic procedures performed at the time of hepatic artery catheter placement. There were no conversions to an open procedure. Mean operative time was 186 minutes (range, 125-280), and mean blood loss was 132 mL (range, 20-300). These values include the 27 major concurrent laparoscopic procedures performed at the time of catheter placement, including 18 cholecystectomies, 7 colectomies, and 2 liver resections. Median hospital stay was 3 days (range, 3-25), with a median return to regular diet of 3 days. There were no intraoperative complications and no deaths secondary to catheter placement. There were 2 late complications, for an overall rate of 10%. For all 17 patients with residual hepatic disease whose chemotherapy was successfully instituted, regression of the metastases was evident by abdominal computed tomographic criteria and CEA levels. Laparoscopic hepatic artery catheterization is both feasible and safe. It incurs all the benefits of a minimally invasive procedure and can be performed at the time of laparoscopic colectomy to avoid the necessity of a second procedure."

In two of the latter cases, resection was possible following WHF (5-FU 1,000 mg/m2 5 h qw). Case 1: A 58-year-old male, with rectal cancer and multiple metastases (H3, synchronous). Arterial infusion was performed 21 times, with the total volume of 5-FU administered being 31.5 g. The size of the lesions was reduced and hepatic resection was performed. The patient later died due to local recurrence and intra-abdominal lymph node metastases. He had survived 2 years and 11 months following hepatic resection and was free from recurrence of hepatic metastases. Case 2: An 82-year-old female, with cancer of the ascending colon, sigmoidal colon and multiple hepatic metastases (H3, metachronous). Arterial infusion was performed 16 times, with the total amount of 5-FU administered being 20 g. A lowering of CEA levels and reduction of tumor size were achieved, and hepatic resection was performed. Seven months following hepatic resection, CEA levels are normal and no distant metastases or recurrence in the residual liver have been found: possibly a complete cure. Even among cases of unresectable hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer, there are some in which resection is possible following hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, with the possibility of complete cure."

CD011134,0,12418053,0,Radiologic imaging modalities in the diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal carcinoma poses a serious public health threat. Detection in its early stages in the best predictor for long-term survival, which is the impetus for population-based screening programs. We believe that full-colon imaging by either DCBE or colonoscopy is necessary for colon cancer screening because flexible sigmoidoscopy, even if perfect, only detects 50% to 60% of colon cancers, a rate far worse than even the worst rate reported for single-contrast barium enema. Screening for colon cancer with flexible sigmoidoscopy is equivalent to performing a ""left"" mammogram for the detection of breast cancer. The role of CT colonography is still to be determined. When confronted with a symptomatic patient, barium enema is applied in conjunction with CT to detect primary colorectal carcinoma, to differentiate it from other benign and malignant processes involving the colon, and to assess for disease extent before surgery in selected high-risk patient populations. Pelvic MRI may be useful in the preoperative assessment of patients with rectal carcinoma as a means for assisting surgical planning. CT, MRI, and barium enema are used in postoperative follow-up for detecting local recurrence and distant spread. In response to known difficulty in discriminating between normal postoperative changes and tumor recurrence and in determining the nature of certain liver lesions, FDG-PET has been approved for the detection and localization of recurrent colorectal cancer in patients with rising CEA levels and indeterminate findings on standard imaging studies. Given its current promise of offering high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, the indications for PET may well expand in the future, but its final role in still to be determined."

CD011134,0,12378215,0,[Value of the preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen as an independent prognostic factor in cancer of the colon and rectum].,"The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has diverse applications when dealing with patients with colon-rectal cancer. The clinical value may be divided between preoperative evaluation of the tumor extension and its prognosis and the postoperative monitoring of the recurrence. We carried out this study to investigate and determine whether there is a relation between the preoperative value of the CEA and survival and if it may be considered as an independent prognosis factor in colon-rectal cancer. We evaluated 122 patients with colon-rectal cancer, who had had curative surgery and we analyzed different variables in univaried and multivaried form, to determine independent prognosis factors (CEA, sex, age, degree of differentiation, tumor size, ganglionar compromise, and the level of wall infiltration). The ganglionar compromise, the level of intestine wall infiltration and the CEA preoperative value lower than 5 ng/ml had a significantly higher survival than those with values higher than 5 ng/ml, regardless of other factors. We concluded that the preoperative determination of Carcinoembryonic Antigen represents a non-invasive study clinically useful in dealing with colon-rectal cancer and that its value has a significant statistical value as an independent prognosis factor in colon-rectal patient survival."

One hundred and twenty patients with suspected recurrence were studied with FDG-PET. Fifty-eight patients were referred for FDG-PET because of the elevation of serum tumour markers. Thirty-one patients were referred because of inconclusive results of conventional imaging modalities. Twenty-five patients had known recurrence and were referred for pre-surgical assessment. Six patients were referred because of abdominal pain. A major management change was considered when, as a consequence of FDG-PET results, medical treatment was changed to surgical, or surgical to medical or to no treatment. A minor management change was considered when changes were made within a treatment modality. Of the 58 patients with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), FDG-PET detected recurrence and led to a major management change in 34 (58%). Eighteen underwent curative surgery and 16 were treated with systemic therapy. Of the 31 patients evaluated because of inconclusive results of conventional imaging modalities, FDG-PET was positive for recurrence in 24 and negative in seven. A major management change took place in 14 patients (45%). Of the 25 patients evaluated to rule out other sites of disease before surgery, FDG-PET did not show any other site of recurrence in 13 (52%) and showed more lesions in the remaining patients. Major management change took place in eight patients (32%). Overall, in the 120 patients studied, FDG-PET resulted in major management changes in 58 (48%), minor changes in four (3%) and no change in 54 (45%). It can be concluded that FDG-PET has a significant impact on the management of patients with suspected recurrence of colorectal cancer. FDG-PET detection of recurrence frequently allows curative surgical intervention. The early identification of distant metastases may also facilitate the implementation of systemic treatment."
CD011134,0,12297926,0,Hepatic resection for colorectal metastases: can preoperative scoring predict patient outcome?,"A retrospective study was performed to define patient selection, safety, and efficacy of hepatic resection for colorectal metastases. The recently proposed preoperative clinical risk score (CRS) for selection of patients for surgery was also assessed. In all, 146 consecutive hepatic resections in 137 patients operated in the period between 1977 and 1999 were studied. Of these patients, 113 were classified into five CRS groups. Perioperative mortality was 1.4% (2 patients; no death in 120 patients operated after 1985) and morbidity was 38%. Five-year actuarial survival (perioperative mortality included) was 29% (median 37 months), and actual 5-year survival was 25% (17/69 patients). Patients operated after 1995 lived longer than those operated before 1995. Multiple regression analyses identified preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen CEA <100 mg/L, nodal status at resection of primary tumor, and R0 vs. R1/R2 resection as prognostic parameters. CRS grouping had prognostic importance. The relative risk (hazard rate) of tumor recurrence in patients with CRS 3-4 was 2.1, compared to that of patients with CRS 0-2. Five-year actuarial survival in the two groups was 12% and 40%, respectively. Fourteen of 15 long-term survivors (>5 years) classified by the CRS system had CRS of 2 or less. Resection for colorectal liver metastases is safe, and long-term survival rates are acceptable. CRS predicts patient outcome, but the clinical role in patient selection will have to be defined in prospective studies."

CD011134,0,12239755,0,[Prognostic importance of preoperative CEA in patients with colorectal cancer].,"Carcinoembryonic antigen is an acid glycoprotein, the levels of which may increase in patients with colorectal carcinoma. The prognostic significance of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels and their relationship to other risk factors are still debatable issues. Among 512 patients operated on for colorectal cancer, whose preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen concentrations were evaluated, linear correlations were established between carcinoembryonic antigen overexpression and carcinoma staging, diameter and grading, though these were not statistically significant. Moreover, metastatic cancers were significantly more frequent in patients with increased plasma concentrations of the marker (> 60 ng/ml). There were no correlations between increased carcinoembryonic antigen levels and age, ploidy, or site and shape of the cancers. As regards survival, patients with normal preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels had a better prognosis in terms both of lower local recurrence rates and long- term survival. In addition. In Dukes stages B and C elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen above the cut-off point can be considered a significant prognostic factor capable of identifying a group of patients at high risk who may be candidates for aggressive adjuvant therapies and follow-up.

Several recent publications have shown that F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography is more sensitive than computed-tomography (CT) in detecting colorectal cancer. In patients with increasing CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) and no evidence of recurrent disease on CT F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography often detects recurrent cancer. In all, patient management seems to be changed in about 25% of patients who undergo F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography in addition to standard staging procedure. Limited reports to date on both chemotherapy and radiotherapy support the role of F-18-fluorodexyglucose-positron emission tomography in assessing treatment response.

CD011134,0,12134365,0,Positron emission tomography for evaluation of colorectal carcinoma.,"Evaluation of patients with known or suspected recurrent colorectal carcinoma is now an accepted indication for FDG PET imaging. FDG PET does not replace imaging modalities such as CT for preoperative anatomic evaluation but is indicated as the initial test for diagnosis and staging of recurrence and for preoperative staging (N and M) of known recurrence that is considered to be resectable. FDG PET imaging is valuable for differentiation of posttreatment changes from recurrent tumor, differentiation of benign from malignant lesions (indeterminate lymph nodes, hepatic and pulmonary lesions), and evaluation of patients with rising tumor markers in the absence of a known source. Addition of FDG PET to the evaluation of these patients reduces overall treatment costs by accurately identifying patients who will and will not benefit from surgical procedures. Although initial staging at the time of diagnosis is often performed during colectomy, FDG PET imaging is recommended for a subgroup of patients at high risk (with elevated CEA levels) and normal CT and for whom surgery can be avoided if FDG PET shows metastases. Screening for recurrence in patients at high risk has also been advocated. FDG PET imaging seems promising for monitoring therapy, but larger studies are necessary."

CD011134,0,12114872,0,"Circulating tumor markers and nuclear medicine imaging modalities: breast, prostate and ovarian cancer.","Clinical oncologists have always shown great interest in circulating tumor markers. There are several markers that in the clinical routine are a signal of particular tumor types; some of them are strictly tissue-specific such as prostatic specific antigen (PSA) for prostatic cancer, AFP and HCG for germ cell tumors of the testis and ovary, others such as CA 15.3, CA125, CEA or cytokeratins are less specific since their elevations can be found in different varieties of cancers even if they are preferentially associated to a certain tumor type, thus are considered markers for breast, ovarian cancer and colon adenocarcinoma. The most useful clinical applications of these parameters is their determination during the follow-up of the treated patients, in order to detect the tumor recurrence early, and also to evaluate the evolution of the disease by monitoring the treatment responses. During follow-up, increasing levels of tumor markers can be observed even several months before the clinical demonstration of cancer recurrence. The association of tumor marker tests with imaging modalities can lead to several advantages: the first is to confirm the diagnosis of relapses, possibly before the appearence of the related clinical symptoms due to tumor growth; the second is to localize the sites of lesions, while tumor markers provide only a general indication of the existence of metastases; the third is to make possible a correct whole body restaging. In the assessment of cancer response tumor markers are often very reliable and their changes are faster than the morphological ones. Among all the imaging modalities, nuclear medicine plays an important role in detecting recurrences and metastatic localizations as it is able to investigate functional rather than morphological aspects of tumors, and provide different information in comparison to morphologic imaging. In addition, the scintigraphic techniques offer the possibility to evaluate treatment responses, confirming or not the information from biochemical changes. This review aims to show some examples (breast, prostate and ovarian cancer) in which the combination of nuclear medicine imaging modalities and tumor marker tests is proposed for clinical practice. The advantages and some critical aspects are discussed on the basis of the clinical findings and the most important clinical indications are described."

CD011134,0,12053228,1,Results of long-term follow-up after curative resection of Dukes A colorectal cancer.,"Patients with Dukes A (UICC I) colorectal cancer have a good prognosis after curative resection. It is not known, however, if the outcome is significantly different for UICC Ia and Ib patients or if patients with reduced risks of recurrences can be identified early after surgery. This is of interest, as it would permit a more cost-effective, patient-oriented, and tumor stage-oriented follow-up program. To study these questions, a prospective follow-up database, including 1375 patients after curative resection of colorectal cancer, was analyzed. A total of 296 patients with Dukes A colorectal cancer with a median follow-up of 44 months were studied. Perioperative and follow-up mortality rates were 3% and 14%, respectively. Recurrent disease developed in 10% of Dukes A patients after a disease-free interval of 16 months. Significantly more patients suffering from pT2 (UICC Ib) cancer had recurrent disease than patients with pT1 (UICC Ia) cancer (13% vs. 4%; p <0.05). Preoperative CEA levels in patients with recurrent disease were significantly higher than in long-term disease-free patients (5.3 +/- 1.8 vs. 3.5 +/- 0.6 ng/ml; p <0.05). Curative resection of recurrent disease was achieved in 38% of the patients with recurrences (4% of all patients). Survival analysis showed significantly better survival in patients with Dukes A cancer than in those at higher tumor stages (log rank, <0.0001), and only 39% of all Dukes A patients who died during follow-up had recurrent disease. Dukes A (UICC Ia and Ib) colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 22% of our patients treated for cure, and long-term survival was 86%. There were significantly fewer cases of recurrent disease after curative resection of UICC Ia (pT1N0M0) cancer, so we propose a novel, less intensive follow-up regimen for these patients, leading to a more cost-effective, patient-oriented, and tumor stage-oriented follow-up program."

The aim of present phase II study was to investigate toxicity and efficacy of ChE for patients, with unresectable colorectal liver metastases after failure of 5-FU based chemotherapy. Secondary endpoint was clinical benefit measurement. Eleven patients were enrolled in first stage (two-stage Simon design), 2 males/9 females, median age 60 (46-71). Performance status was I in 8 patients and II in 3 patients. All patients had radical surgery, 7 of them adjuvant chemotherapy and 4 systemic chemotherapy. The ChE regimen consisted of an injection of iodinated oil Lipiodol with mitomycin C (3 mg/ml). Repeated treatments were performed at 9- to 12-week intervals. We applied 17 ChE (median 1/pts.). Clinical benefit was a composite of measurements of pain, ECOG performance status, weight and tumor fever. Study was stopped after first stage because non of the patients (pts) achieved objective response (RECIST). Stable disease occurred in 5 pts (45%). Median time to progression was 3 months (range 3-9 months). Median survival was 9 months (range 4-16 months). A decrease of the baseline carcinoembryonic antigen level occurred in 0% of the cases. Clinical benefit was recorded in one patient. Common toxicity included a ""postembolization syndrome,"" which consisted of fever, pain in the right upper quadrant, nausea, and vomiting. Grades 3-4 toxicity (NCI-CTC) followed transaminases 6/11, LDH 4/11. In addition, a drop in F V levels was noted in 5 pts, F VII in 9, F IX in 2 and F X in 10 pts. Decrease in At III levels occurred in 6 pts and FDP appeared in one. Thus, The ChE as performed in the present study did not appear to bring any benefit; furthermore, significant liver toxicity compromises the safety of such procedure."

Thirteen hepatic lobes from eight consecutive patients with colorectal cancer referred for 90Y-glass microsphere treatment of unresectable liver metastases who underwent both baseline (pretreatment) and 3-month posttreatment PET were studied. All patients also had correlative pre- and posttreatment CT or MRI for evaluation of the anatomic response and serum CEA determination for assessment of the total tumor load, as well as pretreatment hepatic intra-arterial technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin scan for lung shunting evaluation and hepatic arteriography for assessment of vascular anatomy and treatment. 90Y-glass microspheres were infused via an intra-arterial catheter under low pressure. Dedicated whole-body PET scans were analyzed visually and compared by lesion and by lobe with CT or MRI. A metabolic response after 90Y treatment to single or both hepatic lobes, assessed by PET, was present in a significantly higher proportion of the lobes than was an anatomic response, evaluated by CT or MRI (12 vs 2 lobes respectively, P<0.0002). Posttreatment PET showed no, stable, progressive, and new extrahepatic metastases in two, three, one, and two patients respectively. Following treatment, serum CEA decreased significantly, correlating with PET but not with CT or MRI. Thus, the study demonstrated a significant difference between the metabolic and the anatomic response after 90Y-glass microsphere treatment for unresectable liver metastases in colorectal cancer. PET appears to be an accurate indicator of treatment response."

CD011134,0,11978524,0,Follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer: numbers needed to test and treat.,"Follow-up after curative treatment of patients with colorectal cancer has as its main aims the quality assessment of the treatment given, patient support, and improved outcome by the early detection and treatment of cancer recurrence. How often, and to what extent, the final aim, improved survival, is indeed realised is so far unclear. A literature search was performed to provide quantitative estimates for the main determinants of the effectiveness of the follow-up. Data were extracted from a total of 267 articles and databases, and were aggregated using modern meta-analytic methods. In order to provide one more colorectal cancer patient with long-term survival through follow-up, 360 positive follow-up tests and 11 operations for colorectal cancer recurrence are needed. In the remaining 359 tests and 10 operations, either no gains are achieved or harm is done. As the third aim of colorectal cancer follow-up, improved survival, is realised in only few patients, follow-up should focus less on diagnosis and treatment of recurrences. It should be of limited intensity and duration (3 years), and the search for preclinical cancer recurrence should primarily be performed by carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) testing and ultrasound (US). The focus of colorectal cancer follow-up should shift from the early detection of recurrence towards quality assessment and patient support. As support that is as good or even better can be provided by a patient's general practitioner (GP) or by specialised nursing personnel, there is no need for routine follow-up to be performed by the surgeon."

CPT-11 was administered at 40 mg (90 min i.v.) x 3 day/week, and Isovorin and 5-FU were administered at 25 mg (bolus) and 250 mg (continuous) x 5 day/week by intraarterial infusion. Three cycles of this weekly regimen resulted in regression of tumors in the iliac region with remission of the lameness caused by iliac pain. The serum CEA level decreased from 13.1 ng/ml to 0.5 ng/ml. The patient has undergone 13 cycles of the regimen modified for outpatients (CPT-11 at 40 mg x 3 day/week plus Isovorin at 25 mg and 5-FU at 250 mg 1 day/week) with inhibitions of tumor regrowth and improved serum CEA level for more than 12 months.

Subsequently, CEA was detected in the circulation of patients and recognized as a serum marker for colorectal cancer. This tumor marker has not been advocated as a screening test for colorectal cancer, however a preoperative CEA serum level is useful for diagnosis and prognosis of recurrence and survival in colorectal cancer patients. The levels of CEA increased with increasing tumor stage. Expression of carbohydrate antigen (CA 19-9) has been described in various malignancies and also in colorectal cancer. This antigen also has not been advocated as a screening test for colorectal cancer. The levels of CA 19-9 increased in advanced stages of colorectal cancer. Despite its lower sensitivity than CEA in early stages of colorectal cancer, the combination of both antigens can provided more information than CEA alone for prognosis of recurrence and survival in those patients."
CD011134,0,11956598,0,"Prediction of postoperative survival by preoperative serum concentrations of anti-p53 compared to CEA, CA 50, CA 242 and conventional blood tests in patients with colorectal carcinoma.","Blood samples were obtained preoperatively from 151 consecutive patients who were operated for colorectal carcinoma; of these 132 patients underwent curatively aimed operations. Patients who lived for more than five years without any evidence of relapse were classified as survivors and those who died during follow-up were classified as non-survivors. Tumors were staged according to Dukes and tumor differentiation was classified as high, intermediate or low. Serum anti-p53 was determined in all patients and compared to CEA, CA 50 and CA 242 in serum as well as to blood hemoglobin concentration (Hb), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum alkaline phosphatases (ALP), in the same preoperative blood samples for comparison of power to predict mortality in colorectal cancer. Tumor differentiation and Dukes classification predicted survival and the risk to die of colorectal carcinoma as expected. CA 242 and anti-p53 titers in serum were not significantly different among groups of patients with Dukes A-D tumors, while Hb, ESR, ALP, CEA and CA 50 were significantly different with increasing levels appearing in Dukes C-D, except for Hb which decreased. Survivors had lower ESR, ALP, CEA, CA 50 and CA 242, while Hb and serum anti-p53 titers were not different among survivors and non-survivors. Survivors among Dukes A-C patients had normal Hb, ESR, ALP and CA 242 before operation, while non-survivors had increased ESR, CEA and CA 50. Levels of anti-p53 were unrelated to concentrations of all other blood and serum variables, and did not predict survival in Dukes A-D patients. Serum levels of CEA and CA 50 displayed a significantly altered distribution among survivors and non-survivors (p<0.01). This altered distribution was independent of Dukes A-C tumor stage for CEA (p<0.05) but not for CA 50. Based on these results, we conclude that patients with CEA levels above 15 ng/ml should be regarded as high risk patients even when their tumors are classified as Dukes B. These patients may benefit from neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy."

Three hundred twenty-one consecutive nonselected patients with advanced colorectal cancer were treated with conventional 5-FU-based regimens as first-line treatment from 1988 to 1999. Factors related to patient, tumor, or treatment were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis by comparing short survivors (SS, those who survived <or=6 months) with those who survived longer than 6 months. The same statistical methods were used to analyze 200 patients, all treated with bolus 5-FU regimens, by comparing who progressed to treatment with those who did not. Sixty-two patients (19.3%) were SS, the remaining 259 patients survived more than 6 months. First-line chemotherapy included 5-FU in all patients; 112 (35%) and 27 (8.4%) patients were offered, after disease progression, second and third-line chemotherapy, respectively. The overall response rate to first-line chemotherapy was 12.9%. No SS patient achieved an objective response. To investigate factors associated with progression to first-line chemotherapy, we considered only those patients treated with bolus 5-FU regimens, to eliminate the variable of regimen used. Ninety-six of them progressed to treatment and 104 did not. At multivariate analysis, SS patients were characterized by the following: right and transverse colon primary (p = 0.006), younger age (p = 0.043), poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group >or= 2) (p = 0.015), elevated (>or=5 microg/l) serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (p = 0.015), and more than one site of metastatic disease (p < 0.001). Progression to first-line chemotherapy (p < 0.001) was also a strong factor associated with short survival in multivariate analysis; factors predictive of progression were elevated CEA (p = 0.027) and diffuse metastatic disease (p = 0.029). Our data indicate the relevance of some clinical prognostic factors (younger age, poor performance status, elevated CEA, site of primary, number of metastatic sites, resistance to chemotherapy) as independent factors associated with poor survival and progression to first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with conventional 5-FU regimens. Patients identified by these factors as having a poor prognosis and low probability of response to treatment should be considered either for more aggressive regimens or supportive care only: conventional 5-FU treatments do not impact on response or survival."

To this end, 50 candidate patients with colon cancer for surgery were admitted to the study. Of these, 30 could be subjected to a potentially curative surgery. Cytokine serum levels at several time points before and after surgery were measured by ELISA. Circulating levels of IL-10 and IL-6 were found to be elevated in cancer patients with respect to controls. Both IL-10 and IL-6 serum levels were demonstrated to predict the likelihood of curative surgery (predictive accuracy, 83.3%). IL-10 serum levels returned to normal in all but 6 patients who underwent curative surgery. These latter had tumor recurrence (predictive accuracy, 100%). In contrast, IL-6 serum levels significantly decreased in all patients, regardless of whether cure was surgically achieved, but did not normalize. On multivariate analysis, basal IL-10 serum levels were found to be among the variables significantly predicting the disease-free survival rate. Stepwise regression selected tumor stage, basal IL-10 serum level, and basal CEA serum level as the best combination of variables for prediction of the likelihood of tumor recurrence. In conclusion, preoperative serum levels of IL-10 were shown to be useful markers for predicting both likelihood to perform curative surgery and, in combination with the 16th postoperative day IL-10 serum levels, tumor recurrence (predictive accuracy, 73.6 and 96%, respectively). IL-6 serum levels were found to have a more limited prognostic role."

CD011134,0,12445377,0,Systemic irinotecan or regional floxuridine chemotherapy prolongs survival after hepatic cryosurgery in patients with metastatic colon cancer refractory to 5-fluorouracil.,"Most colorectal cancers metastatic to the liver are resistant to chemotherapy and are not amenable to surgical resection. This study evaluated our 6-year experience (July 1992-July 1998) in treating patients with unresectable hepatic colorectal metastases refractory to systemic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). One hundred fifty-three patients underwent cryosurgical ablation (CSA) of 5-FU-resistant hepatic metastases. The patients then received either hepatic arterial floxuridine (FUDR), systemic CPT-11, or no postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Number, size, and location of hepatic metastases, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, and type of postoperative treatment were analyzed. One to 15 lesions were frozen (median number, 3; median size, 6 cm), for a total of 73 synchronous and 80 metachronous lesions. Overall median survival was 28.4 months from the date of diagnosis of liver metastases and 16.1 months from the time of CSA. After cryosurgery alone, median survival was 13 months, which was significantly shorter than the post-CSA survival of 23.6 months with adjuvant CPT-11 and 21.2 months with hepatic FUDR (P = 0.007). Predictors of survival included preoperative CEA, postoperative reduction in CEA, and adjuvant chemotherapy (P < 0.05). Neither size, number of lesions, nor tumor location impacted survival. At a median follow-up of 13 months, 67% of patients have recurred (35% hepatic, 16% extrahepatic, and 49% both). Twenty percent of the recurrences were in the lobe of the CSA site. The 25 patients who underwent a second CSA had a median survival of 28.4 months from CSA and 40 months from the date of diagnosis of liver metastases. These data indicate that CSA offers an effective alternative for unresectable patients resistant to 5-FU. Systemic CPT-11 or regional FUDR may further prolong survival after CSA."

In about one third of these patients, the lesion is localized and potentially resectable. Typically, the recurrence is characterized by findings on diagnostic imaging studies and may be accompanied by a rise in the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. In a few patients, however, the asymptomatic rise in CEA is not accompanied by diagnostic findings on computed tomography (CT). We report a case herein, of a patient with rising CEA, noted 1 year after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy for node-positive colorectal cancer. CT and laparoscopic exploration were nondiagnostic. In order to further evaluate the rise in CEA, positron emission tomography (PET) was performed. PET revealed an area of increased uptake in the right lobe of the liver. Resection of the metastatic liver lesion resulted in a subsequent drop in the CEA levels."
CD011134,0,12160217,0,Clinicopathological study of mucous pooling referred to as mucinous component (MUC) in colorectal submucosal invasive carcinomas.,"We investigated the significance of a pool of mucin, individually termed mucinous component (MUC), at the leading invasion edge of colorectal submucosal invasive carcinoma (SIC). In particular, we studied the correlation between pathological adverse prognostic factors and stainability of the mucosubstances and tumor-associated glycoconjugates in MUC. We demonstrated that MUCs were present in 21% of SICs, and 20% of SICs with MUC were involved in metastasis or recurrence, while only 6% of SICs without MUC were positive for it (p=0.005). SICs with MUC showed strong staining of carcinoembryonic antigen and Ulex europaeus I in the MUCs as well as in the cancer cells with high-grade atypia. Moreover, the mucins in MUCs predominantly stained for sialomucin. This study was the first to investigate the importance of mucous nodules in colorectal SIC. We concluded that MUC in SIC would be an important adverse prognostic factor, and that we should at least consider employing a similar treatment strategy for it to advanced colorectal carcinoma."

In immunohistochemical studies, this demonstrated a significant affinity for the epithelial tissues so that it was used in a pilot clinical study to perform a radioimmunoscintigraphy of the colorectal primary tumors and their locoregional recurrences. It was labeled with 99mTc using the Schwarz method, with a > 95% performance. Planar images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were performed at 10 minutes, 4-6 hours and 18-24 hours post-injection in the anterior and posterior projections and the SPECT was performed 4-6 hours and 18-24 hours post-injection of 1.85 GBq 99mTC. This study has aimed to verify in vivo the capacity of ior-C5 MAb to accumulate in the malignant colorectal lesions. ior-C5 accumulated in 5 out of the 7 patients who were studied and who were suffering from colorectal cancer or in whom there was suspicion of recurrence. There was a negative case of primary tumors, which was an adenocarcinoma in situ in a tubular-papillary adenoma. The second case with a negative radioimmunoscintigraphy was a true negative case."

A herpes zoster eruption occurred in the same site within two days, but was spontaneously resolved. To the best of our knowledge this is the first description of a false positive [18F]-FDG result in relation to a viral infection of soft tissue.

CD011134,0,11745445,0,Optimizing the use of combined radioimmunotherapy and hypoxic cytotoxin therapy as a function of tumor hypoxia.,"Combined radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) and hypoxic cytotoxin therapy (SR4233 or NLCQ-1) have been evaluated with both modalities administered on the same day with only moderate improvement compared with the effects of RAIT alone. In a series of studies using oxygen electrodes, immunohistochemistry and radiotracers, we have demonstrated that RAIT induces a prolonged state of hypoxia in most tumors, without affecting the pO(2) levels in normal tissues. Using serial microelectrode measurements through subcutaneous (s.c.) GW-39 human colonic xenografts, we established that the median pO(2) was unrelated to the initial size of the tumor, over a range of sizes from 1.0 to 4.0 cm. Fourteen days after mice were given a 240-microCi dose of (131)I-MN-14 anti-carcinoembryonic antigen immunoglobulin G, their median pO(2) declined from 26.1 +/- 9.6 mmHg to 9.8 +/- 3.9 mmHg (p < 0.001). Using the radiotracer (3)H-MISO that accumulates in hypoxic regions, uptake in GW-39, LoVo and LS174T s.c. human colonic tumors increased 3.0- to 4.2-fold from day 14 through day 28 post-RAIT, but uptake of (3)H-MISO in CALU-3 tumors remained unchanged after RAIT. Normal tissue (liver, kidney, lung) uptake of (3)H-MISO did not exhibit significant changes. The increase in tumor hypoxia was also demonstrated visually using anti-PIMO staining of tumor sections. We postulated that sequential delivery of the 2 therapeutic agents, with the hypoxic cytotoxin given 2 weeks after RAIT when tumor pO(2) levels were at their nadir, would improve the therapeutic response above either modality alone or above the 2 agents delivered on the same day. Tumor growth was compared in mice given either RAIT or cytotoxin alone, the combined treatment on the same day or with the cytotoxin delivered 14 days after RAIT. Tumor size on day 35 for RAIT-treated and SR4233-treated GW-39 were 3.56 +/- 0.40 and 7.98 +/- 2.50 cm(3). When RAIT + SR4233 were delivered on the same day, tumor size dropped to 2.78 +/- 0.80 cm(3). If RAIT was given on day 0 and SR4233 on day 14, size further declined further to 1.74 +/- 0.32 cm(3) (p < 0.05 compared with same day delivery). For LS174T, tumor size on day 28 for RAIT-treated and SR4233-treated tumors were 1.14 +/- 0.36 cm(3) and 3.65 +/- 0.78 cm(3), respectively. When RAIT + SR4233 were delivered on the same day, size was 0.51 +/- 0.174 cm(3). If RAIT was dosed on day 0 and SR4233 was given on day 14, tumor size was 0.13 +/- 0.07 cm(3) (p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained for LoVo, but not for CALU-3 tumors. Another hypoxic cytotoxin, NLCQ-1, was also more efficacious 2 weeks after RAIT, compared with same-day dosing. Thus, information on tumor hypoxia after radioantibody therapy could be important for ascertaining a window of opportunity when the surviving tumor regions are most responsive to hypoxic cytotoxins."

Their relationship to clinicopathological variables and patient survival and changes in their levels after surgery were examined. Colorectal cancer patients showed significantly higher serum levels of E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 compared with healthy controls. There was a significant association between the serum levels of these molecules, disease stage and the presence of both lymph node and distant metastases. Both ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 levels correlated with serum E-selectin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Serum levels of all three molecules decreased significantly after radical resection of the tumour. Elevated pre-operative E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 levels were significant prognostic factors, although not independent of stage, for patient survival. These findings suggest that serum concentrations of E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 may reflect tumour progression and metastasis. Since these markers are linked to CEA levels, it is uncertain whether their measurement will prove cost-effective in colorectal cancer management."

Forty patients with suspected recurrence of colorectal cancer, underwent immunoscintigraphy (IS) and helical computed tomography (CT) in the 2 weeks before surgery. Surgical findings were used to evaluate the performance of the imaging techniques. Suspected areas on IS and CT were systematically explored. Helical CT was found to be superior to IS for the liver, the sensitivity and specificity of CT being 100% and 90%, respectively, vs 53% and 100% for IS. However, IS was better than CT for the detection of extra-hepatic abdominal recurrence: sensitivity and specificity of IS were 100 and 82% respectively vs 33 and 82% for CT. Seven cases of peritoneal carcinomatosis were overlooked by helical CT. Our results indicate that IS improves detection of extra-hepatic abdominal recurrence of colorectal cancer.

A local recurrent mass was discovered, and abdomino-perineal resection of the rectum was performed in 1999. The serum CEA level increased gradually August in 2000, but there was no sign of recurrence on CT or MRI. FDG-PET was performed to reveal a presacral recurrent lesion. Total pelvic evisceration combined with resection of the sacrum, and a bilateral ureterostomy were performed in April 2001.

CD011134,0,11680046,0,Follow-up after curative surgery for colorectal cancer.,"Approximately 1 in 3 colorectal patients treated by surgery with curative intent will develop cancer recurrence, and most of them will die from disseminated disease. Post-operative follow-up aims at improving these ominous figures. Any strategy is justified as far as it influences evolution: global survival, disease-free period, quality of life. The value of follow-up for patients remains controversial. The literature review suggests that more intensive follow-ups lead to an increased number of reoperations, a more aggressive oncological approach in non resectable cases, provide data for an efficient quality control and have a major cost impact. Surveillance is appreciated by the patients who are confident in the efficacy of such policies. On the other hand, the benefit on the outcome of the patients is not formally established. Outcome might depend on tumoural characteristics rather than on the moment of recurrence detection. Not all schedules are alike, and CEA determination is required. Including all patients in intensive programs is not evidence-based medicine and is highly cost ineffective. Follow-ups must be tailored to individual characteristics. The most intensive ones are dedicated to the patients with the highest risk of treatable recurrence: high risk patients (tumour site and stage), able and willing to undergo reoperation (age, general condition,...). Research should try to determine curability tumoural factors (genetic tumour factors). In the meantime, and for the other patients, the most effective follow-ups could be programs in which only a few tests are routinely used: referential colonoscopy, history and physical examination, CEA determination and a rectoscopy for rectal cancers."

CD011134,0,11594285,0,[Influence of positron emission tomography on surgical therapy planning in recurrent colorectal cancer].,"The advantages of PET are high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of local tumor relapse, especially in comparison with conventional imaging techniques. Furthermore, there is an additional value of FDG-PET for the detection of tumor manifestations associated with a tumor marker (e.g. serum CEA) increase without suspicious findings in other diagnostic procedures. The methodological advantage of a whole-body examination further improves the detectability of distant metastases. Thus, FDG-PET may induce a change in the therapeutic concept in recurrent colorectal cancer in approximately 30% of cases, concerning the indication for surgery as well as the use of multimodal surgical concepts. By means of the metabolic functional approach FDG-PET offers the possibility of therapy monitoring. This enables very early and more specific indication of response to preoperative therapies or of the presence of residual disease after surgical tumor resection or interventional tumor ablation of metastases or recurrences. PET using new tracer molecules demonstrates an additional advantage of the technique regarding the determination of the micromilieu of a tumor (vascularity, proliferation) compared with all other non-invasive diagnostic methods. This opens up new possibilities to optimize surgical therapy planning and prognostic evaluation."
CD011134,0,11579645,0,[Tumor markers for colorectal cancer].,"CEA and CA19-9 are the two most common tumor markers for colorectal cancer that are currently utilized clinically. The positive rate of CEA is 40-60% and that of CA19-9 is 30-50%. Simultaneous use of the two markers is useful in evaluating the therapeutic effect and monitoring the recurrence of advanced colorectal cancer. Surgical specimens may also provide useful information for the appropriate treatment of patients. Using surgically resected lymph nodes, we examined micrometastasis to assess the spread of the cancer cells and the malignant potential of colorectal cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-cytokeratin antibody revealed no significant impact of micrometastasis on patient prognosis, while RT-PCR assay using CEA as a genetic marker suggested a positive value in predicting a rapid recurrence. Among various molecular markers, we found that CDC25B phosphatase was a powerful prognostic factor for colorectal cancer. Diagnosis of the existence and malignant potential of cancer cells, together with serum tumor marker levels, may help to construct a more useful system for the better treatment of colorectal cancer."

The patient was a 75-year-old man. He underwent resection of the transverse colon, sigmoid colon and distal stomach for colon and gastric cancers. Nine months after the operation, his CEA level increased to 39.5 ng/ml and a CT scan revealed an intra-peritoneal tumor measuring about 5 cm. He received chemotherapy of 30 mg/day of LV that was injected in a bolus and 500 mg/day of 5-FU that was given i.v. by continuous infusion for 10 days. At the end of 2 cycles of this regimen, CT scan demonstrated complete tumor remission and the patient's CEA level decreased to normal level. After an additional cycle of this regimen, he received modulated chemotherapy combined with l-Leucovorin and 5-FU as an outpatient. However, after 3 months of treatment, a recurrent tumor was detected in the same portion and the first regimen was re-started for 5 days. After 4 cycles of treatment the tumor disappeared completely from a CT scan. It is important to investigate effective regimens that do not reduce the quality of life of the patient. This clinical experience suggests that a low-dose LV/5-FU therapy may be beneficial to patients with recurrent colon cancer. Further investigation is necessary to establish an effective regimen that can be given for a long period without adverse effects on quality of life."

Moreover, prognostic association of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) content in serum at the time of surgery is well known. However, fairly unclear is whether quantitative content of CEA and CA19-9 in cancer tissue and adjacent normal mucosa of colorectal cancer patients is correlated to prognosis. Concentrations of CEA and CA]9-9 were analyzed simultaneously in serum, cancer tissue, and normal colonic mucosa of 41 colorectal cancer patients operated for cure. Follow-up data were available for up to 82 months (median, 47 months) after surgery. During the follow-up period, 20 patients had a tumor recurrence, and all these patients died of metastatic disease. Using the median concentration of CEA and CA19-9 in tissues as a cut-off, no difference in overall and disease-free survival was observed between patients with elevated or normal CEA or CA19-9 concentrations in tumor tissue. However, in adjacent histologically normal mucosa, elevated CEA content was associated with significantly shorter overall survival (P = .0385) and disease-free survival (P = .0141) but not CA19-9 content. Despite the unknown biological function of tumor markers in malignant disease, measurement of tumor-associated antigens in colorectal tissues can become an interesting prognostic marker."

CD011134,0,11521792,0,Surgical management of hepatic metastases from colorectal malignancies.,"Liver metastasis represents the major cause of death of patients who have been treated for colorectal adenocarcinoma. Spontaneous survival rarely exceeds two years. Surgery can offer long-term survival and resection should be considered when liver metastases can be totally resected with clear margins and when there is no non-resectable extra-hepatic disease. The choice between anatomical or wedge resection depends on the number and the location of the metastases but does not influence survival. Clamping methods limit blood loss. Operative mortality is generally less than 5%. The five-year survival rate after surgical resection varies from 20% to 45% according to several prognostic factors. The longer survival is observed in patients with fewer than four lesions, with lesions smaller than 4 cm, without extra-hepatic disease, with lesions that appeared more than two years after the resection of a stage I or II colorectal cancer and whose CEA level is normal. After resection, follow-up can detect hepatic recurrence that can be treated with repeat hepatectomy. The efficacy of systemic chemotherapy using new agents can increase the number of patients amenable to surgery. Regional therapies with cryotherapy or radiofrequency ablation can help to treat unresectable or non-totally resectable lesions and may improve survival. The effects on survival of adjuvant treatments, including pre- or postoperative systemic or postoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy, are currently under evaluation."
CD011134,0,11518749,0,Isolated splenic metastasis of sigmoid colon cancer: a case report.,"We report the case of a 62-year-old man who developed isolated splenic metastasis of sigmoid colon cancer. The patient underwent left hemicolectomy for Dukes C sigmoid colon cancer in February 1997. In March 1999, an abdominal CT scan revealed a tumor 3 cm in size at the inferior pole of the spleen. The tumor was hyperechoic on ultrasonography. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal. Since no other site of recurrence was identified, a splenectomy was performed with a curative intent. At laparotomy, neither hepatic metastasis, peritoneal dissemination, lymph node metastasis nor local recurrence was detected. Histological findings of the splenic tumor were compatible with metastasis of the previously resected sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma. The patient has been disease-free for 19 postoperative months. Immunohistochemical staining for urokinase-type plasminogen activator was positive in primary sigmoid colon cancer and splenic metastasis, but negative in lymph node metastasis; results that possibly reflect the difference in progenitor cells between splenic metastasis and lymph node metastasis or the difference in the microenvironment of cancer cells between the spleen and lymph nodes. Based on the present case, we recommend that clinicians pay close attention to the spleen for the early diagnosis of isolated splenic metastasis when routinely evaluating abdominal CT scans and abdominal ultrasonography following curative resection of primary colorectal cancer."

The analyzed factors included microvessel counts stained by CD34 and expression of two adhesion molecules, E-cadherin and CD44 variant exon 6-(v6) in these tumors. No significant factors related to recurrence were identified and only negative expression of CD44v6 tended to correlate with recurrence (P = 0.075). A short disease-free period to recurrence was noted in patients with high CEA levels (>10 ng/ml) and H2/3 classification. A short surgical margin, H2/3 classification, high microvessel counts (>60/field, x200), and negative expression of CD44v6 and E-cadherin tended to be associated with poor prognosis.

This method can reproducibly quantitate 10-10(5) CEA expressing colon carcinoma cells per 10(7) peripheral blood leukocytes, a sensitivity comparable with conventional RT-PCR with a wide linear measuring range. Analysis of peritoneal washes from 241 gastric cancer patients with this assay revealed relative values of CEA transcripts that correlate well with the depth of tumor invasion. The sensitivity and specificity of real-time RT-PCR with a cut-off value of 0.25 were 88% and 81%, respectively. At this cut-off value, patients in the real-time RT-PCR (+) group were found to suffer from peritoneal metastasis with a high frequency, while peritoneal recurrence was very rare among patients with real-time RT-PCR (-) results. These results indicate a positive correlation between CEA mRNA levels in peritoneal washes and patient prognosis.

CD011134,0,11432344,0,[Clinical significance of micrometastasis to lymph nodes in gastrointestinal tract cancers].,"Surgery is the main therapy for malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract. Lymph node metastasis is one of the major factors in predicting patients' clinical course and choosing appropriate adjuvant therapy after surgery. The concept of micrometastasis to regional lymph nodes emerged over 10 years ago, but its significance has been controversial. To clarify the relevance of micrometastasis of gastrointestinal tract cancers, we have established RT-PCT based-diagnostic methods using multi-markers such as CEA, CK20, and Mage 3. Prospective studies have shown that not a few micrometastasis-positive patients with carcinoma of the colon, stomach, and esophagus suffered disease recurrence, even though they did not show histologically positive lymph node metastasis. They were initially diagnosed as node-negative, and thus predicted to be disease free. A retrospective study of 62 patients with stage II node-negative colorectal cancer showed that 5-year overall survival was 78.2% among micrometastasis-positive patients, against 95.3% micrometastasis-negative patients. Moreover, there was a marked difference in 5-year disease-free survival, with 61.4% versus 88.4%, respectively. These data warrant further prospective study with a large population since RT-PCR based detection systems for micrometastasis appear to have the potential to improve conventional diagnosis and therapy for colorectal cancer."

The patients were divided into two groups: low and high antigen groups (lower and higher than a selected diagnostic-based cut-off value). Patients with high serum levels of sialyl Lewisa and carcinoembryonic antigen had shorter disease-free intervals than those with low serum levels of the respective antigen, although sialyl Lewisx and sialyl Tn showed no significant differences. Multivariate analysis revealed that three independent prognostic variables, including depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and serum sialyl Lewisa level, did prove to have value in predicting disease-free interval. In conclusion, among the four antigens examined in this study, the preoperative serum level of sialyl Lewisa is the only independent prognostic variable for recurrence after curative resection of colorectal cancer."

All dissected LNs were mapped anatomically and subjected to detection assays for micrometastases. Immunohistochemical analysis was also performed using anti-pancytokeratin antibody AE1/AE3 to confirm the existence of occult cancer cells. By histological analysis, 20 of 237 LNs contained metastatic cells, and they were all positive by both immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Of the 217 histologically negative LNs, 14 (6.5%) harbored micrometastases by immunohistochemistry, and 57 (26.2%) were positive for at least one of the two genetic markers. Lymphatic mappings of all patients showed that micrometastases were distributed not only at the pericolic LNs but often at distant LNS: Clinical follow-up study showed that two patients developed recurrence within 1 year after surgery, and both of them had RT-PCR-positive micrometastases in not less than 70% of LNs examined. Moreover, both patients had frequent micrometastases at distant LNs, i.e., those around the root or along the inferior mesenteric artery, when compared with patients with no recurrence. Our findings suggest that genetic diagnosis using the RT-PCR method may be clinically useful along with conventional pathological diagnosis, especially when micrometastases spread to distant LNS:"

CEA mRNA was measured by means of RT-PCR amplification as an indicator for micrometastatic malignant cells. Seven of twenty-nine respectable gastric cancer patients (24.1%) [EGC: 2/9 (22.2%), AGC IIIa: 1/5 (20.0%), AGC IIIb: 4/15 (26.6%)] were positive for CEA mRNA on the initial test and 10 of 29 patients (34.4%) [EGC: 2/ 9 (22.2%), AGC IIIa: 1/5 (20.0%), AGC IIIb: 7/15 (46.7%)] were positive on a follow-up test. Only in AGC IIIb, the positive rate for CEA mRNA increased about twice and 6 of 7 positive cases (85.7%) relapsed within 2.6+/-2.4 months after the follow-up test. In colorectal cancer, 4 of 19 patients (21.1%) [B2: 1/6 (16.7%), C2: 3/13 (23.0%)] were positive on the initial test and 10 of 19 patients (52.6%) [B2: 4/6 (66.7%), C2: 6/13 (46.2%)] were positive on a follow-up test showing an increase in positive rates during a follow-up, however, no significant correlation between CEA mRNA positivity and subsequent relapse was demonstrated. These results suggest that an early tumor cell dissemination may occur in gastrointestinal tract cancer without subsequent relapse, however, the serial regular examination of CEA mRNA level may contribute to predicting a subsequent relapse in AGC IIIb in gastric cancer."

All PET images were reviewed with full knowledge of the CDW. The gold standard consisted of histology, or clinical follow-up of more than 1 year. Recurrent disease was established in 56 lesions in 43 patients. On a patient-based analysis, the sensitivity of FDG-PET was 34/43 (79%), and the positive predictive value 34/38 (89%). In 14/50 patients (28%), the FDG-PET findings led to a surgical resection with curative intent. On a lesion-based analysis, FDG-PET detected 42/56 lesions (sensitivity: 75%), the positive predictive value was 79% (42/53).

A total of 308 patients who underwent resection for a colorectal cancer were divided into low and high antigen groups (higher or lower than a selected diagnostic-based cutoff value). The cutoff values were 37 U/ml for CA19-9, 38 U/ml for SLX, 45 U/ml for STN, and 2.5 ng/ml for CEA. The American Joint Committee on Cancer Classification and Stage grouping was used to classify the tumors. Statistical tests were conducted using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. For CA19-9, 81 patients (26.3%) were assigned to the high antigen group: for SLX, 39 (12.7%); for STN, 33 (10.7%); and for CEA, 133 (43.2%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that predictive factors associated with high antigen levels were female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.78 vs male sex), T4 (OR, 3.26 vs T1/T2), and M1 (OR, 3.35 vs M0) for CA19-9; M1 (OR, 6.40 vs M0) for SLX; mucinous carcinoma (OR, 8.45 vs well differentiated adenocarcinoma) and M1 (OR, 8.24 vs M0) for STN; and mucinous carcinoma (OR, 7.21 vs well differentiated adenocarcinoma), T3/T4 (OR, 3.84/4.18, respectively, vs T1/T2), and M1 (OR, 6.39 vs M0) for CEA. In conclusion, high serum levels of CA19-9, SLX, and STN are strongly associated with distant metastasis. In addition, high serum levels of CA19-9 may be an independent predictor for female gender and T4, and high serum levels of STN may be an independent predictor for mucinous carcinoma."

CD011134,0,11273591,0,Follow-up of stage B and C colorectal cancer in the United States and France.,"The optimal postoperative follow-up strategy for patients with resected Dukes' Stage B and C colorectal cancer is controversial. Recently published guidelines support a minimal regimen of carcinoembryonic antigen measurements every 2 to 3 months for at least 2 years, history and physical examination every 3 to 6 months for 3 years, then annually, and colonoscopy every 3 to 5 years. Based on documented practice on the part of surgeons, this regimen would be regarded as intensive. Analyses of relapses following adjuvant therapy support an even more aggressive schedule, with the goal of maximizing the proportion of patients who may be operated on with curative intent (currently about 20% of those who relapse). Additional considerations that may influence the approach to such patients include the identification of second primary tumors (2% over 7 years observation), and the known improvement in quality of life and survival associated with early versus delayed initiation of chemotherapy. However, with the annual investment of resources estimated to be as high as 175 million dollars in the United States alone, a systematic study of such interventions is needed to provide support survival, quality of life, and economic evidence."

CD011134,0,11341176,0,Monoclonal antibody CIBCHTB1 defining an epitope on carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is an oncofoetal protein first identified by Gold and Freedman (1965) in colorectal cancer. It is a cell surface tumor marker which has been characterised as a heterogenous group of glycoproteins. It is also present in a variety of benign and non-neoplastic diseases like ulcerative colitis, Adenomatous polyp, Liver cirrhosis and other cancers like GI tract tumors, Cancer of the breast, lung, ovary, pancreas, prostate, hepatoma etc. Elevated CEA levels serve as clinical tool in the diagnosis, monitoring, detecting early any recurrence or metastasis and in prognostication for confirmed colorectal cancers. In order to develop an Enzyme Immuno Assay and immunocytochemical assay for CEA, an MAb designated as CIBCHTB1 has been generated using CEA isolated from a cell line HT115, human adenocarcinoma of the colon, as immunogen by the conventional Hybridoma technology. This MAb of IgG1 isotope was selected by screening of culture supernatents by ELISA and then by its high binding affinity with HT115 cells as revealed by flowcytometric analysis. By ABC method of immunocytochemical assay, this Ab exhibited strong staining of cells in frozen tissue sections of normal colon and malignant colorectal lesions and various other types of human cancers. This MAb has useful application to study the expression of CEA in human cancers.

CD011134,0,11195411,0,NCCN Practice Guidelines for Colorectal Cancer.,"The NCCN Colorectal Cancer Guidelines panel believes that a multidisciplinary approach is necessary for the management of the patient with colorectal cancer. The panel endorses the concept that treatment of patients in a clinical trial has priority over standard or accepted therapy. The recommended surgical procedure for resectable colon cancer is an en bloc resection; laparoscopic surgery should be done only in the context of a clinical trial. For patients with stage III disease, 5-FU-based adjuvant therapy is recommended. A patient who has metastatic disease in the liver or lung should be considered for surgical resection if he or she is a candidate for surgery and if surgery can extend survival. Surgery should be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The panel advocates a conservative post-treatment surveillance program for colon and rectal carcinoma patients. Serial CEA determinations are appropriate if the patient is a candidate for aggressive surgical resection, should recurrence be detected. Abdominal and pelvic CT scans should be utilized only when there are clinical indications of possible recurrence. Patients whose disease progresses during 5-FU-based therapy should be treated with irinotecan or encouraged to participate in a phase I or phase II clinical trial."

CD011134,0,11044640,0,A clinical nomogram for predicting long-term survival in advanced colorectal cancer.,"From our prospectively accrued database of patients with gastrointestinal cancer, 1057 patients with advanced colorectal cancer were identified with the aim of determining predictive factors for survival of greater than 2 years and to use this information to develop a predictive nomogram. Patient's baseline characteristics, type and number of chemotherapy regimens received, and response to chemotherapy were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression comparing those who survived greater than or less than 2 years. A total of 161 (15.2%) patients survived more than 2 years, so-called long survivors (LS). In multivariate analysis, positive predictive factors for LS were: good performance status (PS), normal serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), rectal primary, Dukes' stage A-B, well or moderate differentiation, two or less disease sites, response to chemotherapy and treatment used protracted venous infusion (PVI) 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in first-line chemotherapy, and the increasing number of chemotherapy treatments received. From these PS, CEA, number of sites and response to first-line chemotherapy were used to develop a nomogram capable of predicting the probability of survival beyond 2 years for an individual patient. This large study confirmed the relevance of known prognostic factors in metastatic colorectal cancer and demonstrated the importance of response to chemotherapy as an independent factor to predict LS. By combining these, we developed a nomogram which provides information which is likely to prove useful in the management of patients with advanced colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,11044360,0,Elevated serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II and IGF binding protein-2 in patients with colorectal cancer.,"This study explored the relationships of serum insulin-like growth factors, IGF-I and IGF-II, and their binding proteins (IGFBP)-2 and IGFBP-3, with key clinicopathological parameters in 92 patients with colorectal cancer (cases). Comparisons were made with 57 individuals who had a normal colonoscopy (controls). Serial changes were examined in 27 cases. As IGF-related peptides are age- and sex-dependent, absolute concentrations were converted to standard deviation scores (SDS). Mean IGF-II SDS were elevated in Dukes A (n = 12, P< 0.001) and Dukes B (n = 25, P< 0.001) cases compared with controls, but not in advanced disease. Compared with controls, mean IGFBP-2 SDS were significantly elevated in patients with Dukes B (P< 0.001), Dukes C (n = 13, P< 0.001) and advanced disease (n = 42, P< 0.0001), with a significant trend from early to advanced disease (one-way ANOVA, P< 0.001). Furthermore, IGFBP-2 SDS were positively related to tumour size (P = 0.01) and fell significantly in patients following curative resection (P = 0.04), suggesting that circulating levels reflect tumour load. We tested the potential tumour marker characteristics of IGFBP-2 SDS against three endpoints: metastasis alone; local pelvic recurrence alone; and metastasis and recurrence combined. The sensitivities for IGFBP-2 alone (>/= + 2SD) were modest at 55%, 46%, and 52%, but in combination with CEA, increased substantially to 90%, 77% and 86%, respectively. We conclude that the serum IGF-II and IGFBP-2 profiles may provide insights into underlying biological mechanisms, and that serum IGFBP-2 may have an adjunct role in cancer surveillance in patients with colorectal cancer."

In order to further evaluate the clinical value of molecular biologic detection of tumour cells we investigated 102 histologically tumour-free (pN0) regional lymph nodes from 51 consecutive, completely resected (UICC R0) colorectal carcinoma specimens for the presence of tumour cell mRNA by RT-PCR specific for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 20 (CK-20). Two lymph nodes located nearest to the primary tumour were investigated in each case. CK-20 mRNA was found in 31 of 51 patients (60.8%) and CEA mRNA in 30 of 51 patients (58.8%), respectively. Identical transcription patterns of CK-20 and CEA mRNA (both positive or both negative) were found in 38 of 51 patients (74.5%). There was a significantly higher proportion of cases with CEA positivity in the lymph nodes of tubulopapillary than of mucinous adenocarcinomas (P< 0.03). Detection of CK-20 and CEA mRNA correlated in nine of 12 cases (75.0%) with the risk of tumour recurrence (not significant) and showed a tendency towards shorter disease-free survival by univariate analysis (not significant). Our data indicate that CK-20 and CEA mRNA detection by RT-PCR may prove useful for the prediction of tumour recurrence of patients with pN0 colorectal carcinoma, although neither reach statistical significance in this series of patients."

CD011134,0,11039718,0,Hepatic sclerosing hemangioma mimicking a metastatic liver tumor: report of a case.,"We present herein the case of a sclerosing hemangioma of the liver which was extremely difficult to differentiate from liver metastasis of rectal cancer, in a 67-year-old woman. All the radiological findings were compatible with liver metastasis; however, marginal pooling of the tumor revealed by computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance imaging scans was inconsistent with a diagnosis of liver metastasis. At laparotomy, the tumor was macroscopically unusual in that it was yellowish elastic-hard with a very clear margin, and thus, it did not have the appearance of a metastatic tumor. Mile's operation and a partial hepatectomy were performed, followed by an uneventful postoperative course and no signs of recurrence. The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level in the peripheral blood was not elevated at any time. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was a rare hepatic tumor, namely, a ""sclerosing hemangioma,"" based on the findings of cellular fibrous stroma containing vascular channels with flattened endothelial cells. Preoperatively differentiating between sclerosing hemangioma and a metastatic liver tumor from colorectal cancer may be very difficult; however, this case demonstrated some interesting characteristics, namely, the serum CEA level was not elevated, marginal pooling of the tumor was found in the enhanced radiological findings, and the tumor was macroscopically unusual. Therefore, the possibility of sclerosing hemangioma should be borne in mind when considering the differential diagnosis of patients suspected of having colorectal liver metastasis. A preoperative biopsy should be carried out and when a laparotomy is performed under the misdiagnosis of colorectal liver metastasis, it is advisable that either an intraoperative needle biopsy or a frozen histological analysis be undertaken to avoid unnecessary extended hepatic resection of this rare benign hepatic tumor."

Although the function of the high concentration of serum-soluble CD26 (sCD26) is unknown, it may be related to the cleavage of biologically active polypeptides. As CD26 or enzymatic activity levels were previously associated with cancer, we examined the potential diagnostic and prognostic value of preoperative sCD26 measurements by ELISA in colorectal carcinoma patients. We found a highly significant difference between sCD26 levels in healthy donors (mean 559.7 +/- 125.5 microg l(-1)) and cancer patients (mean 261.7 +/- 138.1 microg l(-1)) (P< 0.001). A cut-off at 410 microg l(-1)gave 90% sensitivity with 90% specificity which means that the diagnostic efficiency of sCD26 is higher than that shown by other markers, particularly in patients at early stages. Moreover, sCD26 as a variable is not related with Dukes' stage classification, age, gender, tumour location or degree of differentiation. With a follow-up of 2 years until recurrence, preliminary data show that sCD26 can be managed as a prognostic variable of early carcinoma patients. In addition, the origin of sCD26 is discussed."

To overcome these problems, we have established a rapid and quantitative detection method using a novel real-time fluorescence PCR system (LightCycler). Using this device with hybridization probes as fluorophores, we detected CEA mRNA in peritoneal washes during surgery (within 3 hr) without any post-PCR procedure. This method could reproducibly quantitate 10 to 10(6) CEA-expressing colon carcinoma cells per 10(7) peripheral blood leukocytes, a comparable sensitivity to conventional RT-PCR with a wide dynamic range. Analysis of peritoneal washes from 109 gastric-cancer patients with this assay revealed relative values of CEA transcripts that correlated well with the depth of tumor invasion (p < 0.01). Average values of CEA transcript in peritoneal washes in patients with cytology (-)/RT-PCR(-), cytology (-)/RT-PCR(+) and cytology (+)/RT-PCR(+) results were 0.64, 1,525 and 6,715, respectively. Moreover, CEA transcripts in peritoneal washes in patients with synchronous peritoneal metastasis were more than 50-fold higher than in those without metastasis. These results suggest a positive correlation between CEA mRNA levels in peritoneal washes and prognosis. We conclude that real-time RT-PCR with hybridization probes is a sensitive, quantitative, specific and rapid method to detect free cancer cells in peritoneal washes. This clinically relevant system is a powerful technique to evaluate the risk of peritoneal recurrence in patients with gastric cancer."

The ability to predict this group of patients would allow better targeting of appropriate therapy. It has been shown previously that patients with overt hepatic metastases have significantly high levels of carcinoembryonic antigen in gallbladder bile compared with serum levels. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of bile carcinoembryonic antigen levels taken at the time of operation in predicting patients with occult hepatic metastases.

CD011134,0,10954187,0,Cryotherapy for liver metastases.,"Cryotherapy is undergoing a renaissance in the treatment of nonresectable liver tumors. In a prospective case control study we assessed the morbidity, mortality, and efficacy of hepatic cryotherapy for liver metastases. Between January 1996 and September 1999 a total of 54 cryosurgical procedures were performed on 49 patients (median age 66 years, 21 women) with liver metastases. Patient, tumor, and operative details were recorded prospectively. Liver metastases originated from colorectal cancer (n=37), gastric cancer (n=3), renal cell carcinoma (n=2), and other primaries (n=7). Median follow-up was 13 months (1-32). The median number of liver metastases was 3 (range 1-10) with a median diameter of 3.9 cm (range 1.5-11). Twenty-one patients (43%) had cryoablation only, and 28 (57%) had liver resection in combination with cryoablation. One patient (2%) died within 30 postoperative days. Another 13 patients (27%) developed reversible complications. In 19 of 25 patients (76%) with preoperatively elevated serum CEA and colorectal metastases it returned to the normal range postoperatively. Twenty-eight patients (57%) developed tumor recurrence, eight of which with involvement of the cryosite. Overall median survival patients was 23 months, and survival in patients with colorectal metastases was 29 months. Hepatic cryotherapy is associated with tolerable morbidity and mortality. Efficacy is demonstrated by tumor marker results. Survival data are promising; however, long-term results must be provided to allow comparison with other treatment modalities."

College of American Pathologists Consensus Statement 1999.,"Under the auspices of the College of American Pathologists, the current state of knowledge regarding pathologic prognostic factors (factors linked to outcome) and predictive factors (factors predicting response to therapy) in colorectal carcinoma was evaluated. A multidisciplinary group of clinical (including the disciplines of medical oncology, surgical oncology, and radiation oncology), pathologic, and statistical experts in colorectal cancer reviewed all relevant medical literature and stratified the reported prognostic factors into categories that reflected the strength of the published evidence demonstrating their prognostic value. Accordingly, the following categories of prognostic factors were defined. Category I includes factors definitively proven to be of prognostic import based on evidence from multiple statistically robust published trials and generally used in patient management. Category IIA includes factors extensively studied biologically and/or clinically and repeatedly shown to have prognostic value for outcome and/or predictive value for therapy that is of sufficient import to be included in the pathology report but that remains to be validated in statistically robust studies. Category IIB includes factors shown to be promising in multiple studies but lacking sufficient data for inclusion in category I or IIA. Category III includes factors not yet sufficiently studied to determine their prognostic value. Category IV includes factors well studied and shown to have no prognostic significance."
CD011134,0,10873071,0,Pilot study of a dual gene recombinant avipox vaccine containing both carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and B7.1 transgenes in patients with recurrent CEA-expressing adenocarcinomas.,"Coordinated presentation of antigen and costimulatory molecules has been shown to result in the induction of an antigen-specific T-cell response rather than the development of anergy. This study evaluated the vaccine ALVAC-CEA B7.1, a canary pox virus that has been engineered to encode the gene for the tumor-associated antigen carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and B7.1, a T-cell costimulatory molecule. Patients with CEA-expressing tumors were immunized with 2.5 x 10(7) (n = 3), 1.0 x 10(8) (n = 6), and 4.5 x 10(8) (n = 30) plaque-forming units intradermally every other week for 8 weeks. Patients with stable or responding disease received monthly boost injections. Biopsies of vaccine sites were obtained 48 h after vaccination to evaluate leukocytic infiltration and CEA expression. Induction of CEA-specific T-cell precursors was assessed by an ELISPOT assay looking for the production of IFN-gamma. Therapy was well tolerated, without significant toxicity attributable to vaccine. All patients had evidence of leukocytic infiltration and CEA expression in vaccine biopsy sites. Six patients with elevated serum CEA values at baseline had declines in their levels lasting 4-12 weeks. These patients all had stable disease after four vaccinations. After four vaccinations, patients who were HLA-A-2-positive demonstrated increases in their CEA-specific T-cell precursor frequencies to a CEA-A2-binding peptide from baseline. The number of prior chemotherapy regimens was inversely correlated with the ability to generate a T-cell response. ALVAC-CEA B7.1 is safe in patients with advanced, recurrent adenocarcinomas that express CEA, and it is associated with the induction of a CEA-specific T-cell response."

Six courses of adjuvant chemotherapy (Mayo protocol) were started within four weeks of surgery. During follow-up, serial serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels became progressively elevated in an otherwise asymptomatic patient who showed no signs of recurrence in any of the conventional imaging tests performed (chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, and abdominal CT-scan).

We studied which factors controlled the tumor growth rate using modern immunohistochemical methods.
CD011134,0,10857181,0,Identification of lymph node metastases in recurrent colorectal cancer.,"Lymph node metastases are an important prognostic prediction factor in patients with recurrent colorectal cancer, particularly those with liver metastasis. Fifty-six patients with recurrent colorectal cancer were operated by us using the RIGS (radioimmunoguided surgery) technology. Patients were injected with 1 mg monoclonal antibody (MoAb) CC49 labeled with 2 mCi 125I. In surgery, traditional exploration was followed by survey with a gamma-detecting probe. Sixty of 151 patients enrolled in the Neo2-14 Phase III study for recurrent colorectal cancer were diagnosed with liver metastases based on preoperative CT. In 17/56 patients (30%), RIGS identified at least one tumor site confirmed by pathology (H&E). This resulted in 16 major changes in surgical plan. RIGS performance varied between lymphatic and non-lymphatic tissue, with positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% for non-lymphoid tissue, compared to PPV of 46.5% and NPV of 100% for the lymphoid tissue. Thirty-five out of 60 patients were considered resectable after traditional evaluation. RIGS identified occult tumor in 10 of these patients (28.5%). 7/10 occult patients expired (70%), while only 7/25 of the non-occult patients expired (28%) (P = 0.046). In localizing patients, no RIGS activity in lymph nodes signifies no tumor, while H&E confirmation is needed for decisions based on RIGS activity in the lymph nodes. RIGS provides important staging information, identifying patients for whom surgery may be done with curative intent."
CD011134,0,10857180,0,Probe-guided surgery for colorectal cancer.,"Anti-CEA-scintigraphy turned out to be very reliable in detecting primary and recurrent colorectal cancer, its overall accuracy being more than 90%. The intraoperative application of this technology should provide similar results when focussing at extrahepatic tumor deposits, for example in lymph nodes, thus allowing accurate staging of the underlying disease. To test this hypothesis we launched the following feasibility study the results of which are compared to those reported in the recent literature. We investigated 20 patients, six with rectum and 14 with colon cancer. 24 hours before surgery they were intravenously given 1 ml of a fab'-fragment-antibody to CEA, labeled with 25 mCi of 99mTc (CEA-Scan). During surgery the radioactivity in lymph glands regional to the tumors was measured and compared to the much lower activity in healthy nodes. For this we used a scintillation probe (C-Trak, Care Wise, Inc., Morgan Hill, CA). All lymph nodes of interest were then excised and submitted to frozen section pathology. In 7 out of 20 cases scintimetry led to an up-staging of the disease. In addition we found metastatic spread to lymph nodes that were basically not regional to the primary tumor (retroperitoneum, renal hilum etc.). Scintimetry can precisely identify even very small tumor deposits. So it leads to accurate staging while surgery is still ongoing. In a further step the concept of sentinel node diagnosis, which is right now being clinically evaluated, may some day be applied in colorectal surgical oncology."
CD011134,0,10855627,0,Safety and efficacy of arcitumomab imaging in colorectal cancer after repeated administration.,"In pivotal phase III clinical trials for detecting recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer, most patients received a single arcitumomab injection. However, the early detection of postsurgical recurrence or metastases with arcitumomab will necessitate serial studies for surveillance. We present immunogenicity, safety, and imaging data supporting the use of multiple administrations of arcitumomab."
CD011134,0,10815889,0,Radioimmunoguided surgery in colorectal cancer using a genetically engineered anti-CEA single-chain Fv antibody.,"In radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS), a radiolabeled antibody is given i.v. before surgery and a hand-held gamma-detecting probe is used to locate tumor in the operative field. The rapid blood clearance and good tumor penetration of single-chain Fv antibodies (scFv) offer potential advantages over larger antibody molecules used previously for RIGS. A Phase I clinical trial is reported on RIGS with scFv (MFE-23-his) to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Thirty-four patients undergoing surgery for colorectal carcinoma (17 primary tumors, 16 liver metastases, and 1 anastomotic recurrence) and 1 patient with liver metastases of pancreatic carcinoma received 125I-labeled MFE-23-his scFv (125I-MFE-23-his) 24, 48, 72, or 96 h before operation. 125I-MFE-23-his showed biexponential blood clearance with alpha and beta half-lives of 0.32 and 10.95 h, respectively. The abdomen was scanned during surgery with a hand-held gamma detecting probe (Neoprobe Corp.). 125I-MFE-23-his showed good tumor localization; comparison with histology showed overall accuracy of 84%. Highest median ratios for tumor:normal tissue and tumor:blood were recorded 72 or 96 h after scFv injection for patients undergoing resection of liver metastases. High levels of radioactivity were found in the kidneys. Five patients had grade 1 fever, and three had a grade 1 rise in blood pressure according to the Common Toxicity Criteria. There was a significant correlation between these ratios and those measured in excised tissues using a laboratory gamma counter (P < 0.001). MFE-23-his scFv antibody localizes in CEA-producing carcinomas. The short interval between injection and operation, the lack of significant toxicity, and the relatively simple production in bacteria make MFE-23-his scFv suitable for RIGS."
CD011134,0,10814560,0,Immunomodulation therapy in colorectal carcinoma.,"There has been much progress in the understanding of the relationship between the immune system and colorectal cancer. This has led to the use of immunomodulatory therapy in the adjuvant and palliative treatment of the condition. Although attempts at the use of non-specific immunomodulation with agents such as levamisole, cimetidine, alpha interferon and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) have not produced significant clinical benefits when tested in randomized trials in both the adjuvant setting and for metastatic disease, promising results are being obtained with more specific therapy. Edrecolomab [corrected], a murine monoclonal antibody targeting the 17-1A antigen on malignant colorectal cells has produced a reduction in relapse and mortality rates when used as adjuvant treatment following surgery for Dukes' C colon cancer. Active specific therapy with autologous tumour vaccine administered with BCG has produced similar benefits in Dukes' B cancer. Both 3H1 anti-idiotypic antibody against carcinoembryonic antigen and 105AD7 antibody to gp72 glycoprotein have demonstrated in-vitro and in-vivo immune activation against tumour. Non-randomized studies postulate prolongation of survival using these antibodies in advanced disease. These agents are all currently being tested in randomized studies powered to detect meaningful survival differences and clinical benefit. Immune therapy offers the potential of low toxicity therapy in colorectal cancer and may have a role as an adjunct to conventional chemotherapy."
CD011134,0,10811351,0,A carcinoembryonic antigen-secreting adenocarcinoma arising within a retrorectal tailgut cyst: clinicopathological considerations.,"Retrorectal tailgut cysts (TGC) develop from postanal fetal gut remnants. They have specific radiological and histopathological features that distinguish them from dermoid cysts, enteric duplication cysts, and teratomas. We report a patient with a carcinoembryonic antigen-producing adenocarcinoma arising within a TGC who underwent resection through a combined anterior laparotomy/posterior pelvic approach. Despite complete resection and delayed but complete functional recovery, diffusely metastatic disease was encountered 6 months after resection. Diagnostic, therapeutic, histopathological, and oncological implications of this illustrative case are discussed. It seems possible to use carcinoembryonic antigen measurements for treatment planning and for assessing treatment response for this rare disease. The described outcome also suggests that TGC can develop malignant degeneration and should be resected at the time of diagnosis."
CD011134,0,10796051,0,Impact of 18F-FDG-positron emission tomography for decision making in colorectal cancer recurrences.,"Diagnostic imaging for suspected tumour recurrence of primary colorectal cancer frequently lacks specificity and sensitivity. The impact of whole body 18F-FDG-positron-emission tomography (PET) on detection of local recurrences and hepatic or pulmonary metastases was evaluated in a prospective study. Results were compared with computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and conventional chest X-ray. The study included 71 patients (77 investigations) with suspected local recurrence, hepatic metastases or unexplained raised level of the tumour marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The results demonstrate that 18F-FDG-PET was clearly superior to CT with regard to detection of hepatic metastases. Sensitivity was 1.0 and specificity 0.98 compared with 0.87 and 0.91 for CT. In four cases, 18F-FDG-PET clarified otherwise unclear local recurrences. In five patients, 18F-FDG-PET showed pulmonary metastases that had previously been unknown. In a total of 16 patients (20.8%), 18F-FDG-PET provided additional information leading to a change of the treatment strategy. 18F-FDG-PET clearly has the ability to detect colorectal tumour recurrence and its metastases in a whole body format. Therefore, it may be applied in the follow-up of patients with primary colorectal cancer. Despite the costs, it is certainly recommended for patients with an otherwise unclear increase of CEA level or with unproven local recurrence."

It is necessary to detect local recurrence in a resectable stage to have an opportunity for curative reintervention or palliative prevention of those symptoms. Because most local recurrences occur extraluminally, conventional follow-up fails to detect them at an early stage. Therefore, a prospective study was performed to assess the diagnostic potential of endorectal and endovaginal ultrasound to detect asymptomatic resectable local recurrence."

Previously treated and failed pts with histologically confirmed, measurable metastatic colorectal cancer, performance status (WHO) 0-2 and adequate bone marrow function were eligible for treatment. Patients received 5FU (2.6 g/m2) as a 24-hour continuous infusion. Treatment was repeated weekly. A total of 202 cycles were given. Eighteen pts were enrolled. No pts achieved objective response. In 6 pts (33%), after 4 weeks of treatments, CEA level decreased 25% or more, and after 8 weekly treatments it rose again. Mild myelosuppression rarely occurred. Grade I nausea and vomiting occurred in 2 pts and Grade I diarrhea occurred in 2 pts. Mucositis was not observed."
CD011134,0,10770561,0,Resection of synchronous liver metastases from colorectal cancer.,"The prognosis for patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer is still poor. Thus, patient selection for hepatic resection is essential to improve the poor results of the procedure. Some reports have shown that the prognosis for patients with synchronous liver metastases is worse than that for those with metachronous liver metastases. Therefore, determination of the factors that influence outcome after resection of synchronous liver metastases is more important than with metachronous liver metastasis."
CD011134,0,10769718,0,Biliary carcinoembryonic antigen levels can predict metachronous liver metastasis of colorectal cancer.,"We set out to determine whether carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in gallbladder bile and serum can predict metachronous liver metastasis of colorectal cancer. At the time of surgery, gallbladder bile and serum were sampled for enzyme immunoassays of CEA. Upper limit (mean +/- 2SD) of the normal range for CEA in bile was established from samples at surgery for nonneoplastic gallbladder disease. In 11 patients with synchronous liver metastases, biliary CEA levels correlated with the size of hepatic lesions. In 49 patients without evident liver metastases at the time of surgery, elevated biliary CEA levels predicted subsequent emergence of metachronous liver metastases with 75% sensitivity, 85% specificity, and 84% accuracy; serum CEA levels were not a reliable predictor. In conclusion, determination of biliary CEA level at the time of colorectal resection shows promise as a way to identify patients at high risk for hepatic recurrence."

CD011134,0,10763141,0,Prognostic significance of CEA and CA 19-9 in colorectal cancer in Kuwait.,"Preoperative CEA and CA 19-9 levels have been used in the past as prognostic indicators in colorectal cancer, but Dukes' stage is still considered to be the most important prognostic factor. Recent survival estimates may have been influenced by the fact that in the last decade adjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative irradiation have been included in the routine management of advanced-stage disease. In a heterogeneous Kuwaiti population higher reference levels (95th percentile) of CEA and CA 19-9 have been found than those usually employed. In the present study 62 patients with Dukes' stage B + C could be analyzed for two-year disease-free survival (DFS). Relapse was observed in 19 patients, 28 patients were disease free and 15 patients with censored observations were included. No significant difference in DFS was observed in Dukes' B (69%) versus Dukes' C (48%) patients (p = 0.09). On the other hand, Dukes' stage B + C patients with elevated preoperative levels of CEA or CA 19-9 had a significantly poorer DFS than patients with normal levels. For CEA levels below or above the cutoff the DFS was 74% versus 23% (p = 0.003); for CA 19-9 levels below or above the cutoff the DFS was 71% versus 33% (p = 0.004). In 54 patients with Dukes' stage B + C for whom preoperative levels of both CEA and CA 19-9 were available multivariate analysis revealed a decreasing risk of relapse in the following order: CEA and/or CA 19-9 elevated (chi-square 7.09; p = 0.008), CA 19-9 elevated (chi-square 6.27; p = 0.01), CEA elevated (chi-square 5.47; p = 0.02), and Dukes' C (chi-square 2.08; p = 0.15 n.s.). Hence, novel treatment protocols may have improved the disease-free survival, but the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is of questionable benefit in patients who have elevated levels of CEA and/or CA 19-9 prior to treatment."

CD011134,0,10745140,0,Ferumoxide-enhanced MRI in patients with colorectal cancer and rising CEA: surgical correlation in early recurrence.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of Ferumoxide-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the detection of hepatic metastases in high-risk patients treated for colorectal cancer that have rising CEA. We used 19 patients treated previously for colorectal cancer with rising CEA levels underwent an unenhanced T(1)-weighted (T1W), T(2)-weighted (T2W), STIR, and Ferumoxide-enhanced hepatic MRI. Following these studies, a laparotomy was performed and the liver was evaluated by palpation and intraoperative ultrasound. Two observers who were blinded to surgical results evaluated each MR sequence separately. The number of lesions considered highly suspicious for metastatic lesions were determined for each sequence and were compared to the results of surgery. The McNemar test was used to compare the outcomes of the different sequences. MR Imaging was unable to detect small (<5 mm) metastases discovered at surgery. The best non-contrast sequences for detecting metastases were the STIR with 42% sensitivity, 83% specificity and an overall accuracy of 56% and the T1W sequence (sensitivity 38%, specificity 100%, accuracy 57%), which were not significantly different (p 0.4). The noncontrast T2W sequence had a sensitivity of 29% and a specificity of 77% with an overall accuracy of 46%. When all pre contrast scans were grouped together the common sensitivity was 42%, specificity was 77% and accuracy was 54%. The post-ferumoxide T(2)W scans had a sensitivity of 42%, specificity of 85%, and accuracy of 57%, but did not detect any additional lesions. There was no statistical difference between the pre- and post-contrast studies with regard to identifying patients with metastatic disease (p 0.1). In conclusion, we found small hepatic metastases in patients with early signs of recurrent colorectal cancer are difficult to detect on MRI. Ferumoxide-enhanced MRI was unable to detect additional hepatic metastases and performed no better than unenhanced MRI in detecting small hepatic metastasis."

The aims of this study were to evaluate the results of resecting the local recurrence of rectal cancer and to analyze factors that might predict curative re-resection and those that affect survival. Forty-seven patients who underwent resection for locally recurrent rectal cancer formed the basis of the study. Twenty-four were curative in nature, and the others were palliative. There was no operative mortality, and the complication rate was 38%. The median survival of the whole group was 16.5 months. The ability to perform curative resection was found to be the only independent factor associated with improved survival. Female gender is a significant factor associated with curative resection of local recurrence. In patients with curative reresection, local control is up to 87%. It was concluded that resection of local recurrent rectal cancer can achieve good local control and can improve survival in selected patients. The ability to perform curative resection is associated with survival benefit, and female gender is associated with the increased possibility of carrying out curative resection."

CD011134,0,19629871,0,"Technology evaluation: CEA-Scan, Immunomedics Inc.","Imaging of cancer by radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) following administration of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or fragments has been under development for two decades. Efficacy is a function of many variables: antigen expression on tumor cells relative to normal tissues and body fluids, affinity, specificity, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of the mAb and properties of the radionuclide and imaging techniques. CEA-Scan (a 99mTclabeled Fab' fragment of a mouse mAb directed against CEA) has several advantageous properties, and has been approved for use in colorectal cancer SPECT imaging in North America and Europe, and is also under investigation in Japan. It has been shown to complement CT in detecting recurrent or metastatic disease, even in the liver where 111In mAbs frequently fail. In breast cancer, it provides clearer identification of malignant disease in patients with indiscriminate mammography. Recently, it has also been used intra-operatively in radio-immunoguided surgery in both colorectal and breast cancer patients. These new applications are currently under active investigation and clinical trials are planned. Clinically useful information is obtained in a relatively high percentage of patients, which can alter treatment decisions. In most cases the benefits are in reducing unnecessary surgery or biopsies in inoperable patients, but major benefits (especially in colorectal cancer) would be obtained if new therapies effective against the RIS-detected minimal residual disease were forthcoming."
CD011134,0,11122815,0,The role of carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring in management of colorectal cancer.,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is an important tool in the management of colorectal cancer. Its use as a prognostic indicator in resectable disease remains controversial but may be improved with molecular detection of the antigen. In monitoring patients after resection, CEA can be the first sign of a potentially curable recurrence. It can also be useful in assessing tumor response in patients being treated for metastases without easily measurable disease. CEA alone cannot dictate the type or duration of treatment but may be used in addition to standard monitoring tests."
CD011134,0,10642939,0,Detection of tumor cell contamination in peripheral blood by RT-PCR in gastrointestinal cancer patients.,"We analyzed the peripheral blood of patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer at different stages to assess the presence of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which we used as an indicator for micrometastatic malignant cells. A total of 35 gastric, 24 colorectal, 4 esophageal and 4 biliary tract cancer patients and nine normal healthy subjects were studied. No CEA mRNA was detected in the nine normal healthy volunteers. CEA mRNA was detected in 100% (10/10) of metastatic, 33.3% (3/9) of early gastric cancer (EGC), and 18.8% (3/16) resectable gastric cancer patients, respectively. In colorectal cancer, 55.6% (5/9) of metastatic cancers were positive for CEA mRNA, and 26.7% (4/15) Duke stage B/C showed positive. One patient with stage III gastric cancer who was negative CEA mRNA initially and turned positive during follow-up, developed multiple bone metastasis one month later. Another stage III patient, who was positive for CEA mRNA, preoperatively revealed early relapse in two months. These results suggest that the identification of circulating tumor cells using RT-PCR for the detection of CEA mRNA is feasible and this analysis may be a promising tool for early detection of micrometastatic circulating malignant cells in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer."
CD011134,0,10635303,0,[Detection of serum p53 antibodies in colorectal cancer patients and the clinical significance of postoperative monitoring].,"p53 protein overexpression was found to induce the production of antibodies in patient serum and, recently, the easy detection of serum antibodies has been made possible. The aim of this study is to determine the significance of serum p53 antibodies in patients with primary colorectal adenocarcinoma in comparison with their clinicopathological features, and the tumor marker sensitivities of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carcinoma antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Thirty-nine of 86 patients (45.3%) were positive for serum p53 antibodies. However, there was no relation with the cancer progression or clinicopathological findings. The sensitivities of CEA, CA19-9 and AFP were 36.0%, 38.4%, and 8.1% respectively, but there was no relation between serum p53 antibodies and these three markers. When the sensitivity of serum p53 antibodies and CEA was evaluated according to clinical stage, the presence of serum p53 antibodies was more significantly associated with stage 0, I and II colorectal cancer than was CEA. Thirty-three patients who showed preoperative positivity for serum p53 antibodies were followed by serial evaluation of circulating antibodies after resection. Negative conversions after resection were significantly higher in the ""Cur A"" group than in the ""Cur B"" or ""Cur C"" groups. Serum p53 antibodies appear to be a useful tumor marker independent of the other markers, especially in the early stage, and are expected to be useful in the development of a method of early diagnosis for mass screening, and as a postoperative monitoring marker for colorectal cancer."

CD011134,0,10626169,0,Radioimmunoguided surgery.,"Although clinical staging of neoplastic diseases has long remained the only approach to prognosis and treatment, parameters for stage determination, such as tumor size (T) and lymph-node involvement (N), do not always provide effective indication of optimal treatment. Molecular medicine has also provided useful indications as to an alternative and/or integration to clinical staging. Despite the numerous possibilities afforded by pre-operative staging techniques, failures in defining the real spread of neoplasias into surrounding structures have remained a very important diagnostic problem. The labeling of monoclonal antibodies binding with neoplastic target cells by way of radioactive isotopes introduced the techniques known as immunoscintigraphy and SPECT, which then evolved into radioimmunoguided surgery. Fourty patients suffering from colorectal cancer whose age ranged between 42-82 years were singled out for this study. Before undergoing surgery, they were administered pancoloscopy and macrobiopsies, AP-LL chest x-rays, hepatobiliary ECT, echoendoscopy, abdomen and pelvis CT with nephrostographic phase, and total body bone scintigraphy. They were treated with 125I-B72.3 and 125I-FO23C5 (5% and 95% of patients, respectively). Thyrosuppression was achieved by Lugol solution (15 drops x 3/die) from the 6th day before infusion and until the day of surgical operation. Radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) has also been tested on staging and second-look of ovarian tumors. Five years after surgical operation the survival rate of Dukes A patients (15%) was confirmed to amount to 100%, whereas for Dukes B patients (50%) having undergone RIGS-guided exeresis on single unrecognized metastases (2 patients) and on unrecognized n+ (5 patients) the survival rate was found to be 85% after 5 years; 2 patients deceased due to relapse; 1 patient deceased due to e.p.a. Finally, for Dukes C patients; (35%) having undergone RIGS-guided exeresis on unrecognized liver micrometastases (1 patient), on single isolated metastases (2 patients) and in the occurrence of multicentric lymph-node positivity (9 patients), the survival rate after 5 years was found to amount to 64%; 5 patients deceased due to relapse. Out of 19 patients without pre-operative evidence of ovarian tumor as opposed to just 1 patient suspected of pelvic recurrence, after intra-operative surgical radicalization (45%), 1 patient was diagnosed fibrosis (suspicious lesion on CT) and 1 other patient peritoneal MTS (negative CT) by means of RIGS. RIGS has made it possible: to localize primary and/or metastatic lesions; to determine tumor-free margins, loco-regional disease spread; to differentiate suspicious foci on inspection and palpation (biotopic sampling); to detect invisible and impalpable tumor foci (occult sites); to verify radical exeresis; to evaluate lymphatic drainage stations; to enable guided exeresis of liver metastases."

CD011134,0,10603755,0,[Positron-emission tomography with gamma camera in patients with colorectal and anal cancer. Preliminary results].,"Metastasectomy after the primary surgical treatment of colorectal cancer may prolong survival in patients with resectable recurrences. Dedicated 18F-FDG-PET is of growing interest as a diagnostic tool in the staging and diagnosis of recurrent disease. We wanted in our departments to investigate whether a dual-head gamma camera with coincidence detection could serve as a substitute for the dedicated PET scanner. Twenty consecutive PET scans of 18F-FDG were performed by means of an Adac VertexPLUS gamma camera in 14 patients with colorectal cancer and four patients with anal cancer with known or suspected recurrences. Evaluation of the patients were, however, according to the routine in the department. In fourteen patients one or more abnormal foci were detected by PET, nine of these were verified by biopsy and one by renewed CT scan. In the four patients with negative PET the findings were in agreement with later biopsies. In one patient PET was ""falsely"" negative with regards to other processes than a solitary metastasis to be removed, as he six months later revealed dissemination confirmed by biopsy. Four patients with positive PET findings and elevated CEA remain to be evaluated. We conclude that PET with a coincidence detection gamma camera in this preliminary study seems to have the same possibilities to stage and diagnose recurrent anal- and colorectal cancer as the dedicated PET scanner."
CD011134,0,10589767,0,Characterization of p53 mutations in colorectal liver metastases and correlation with clinical parameters.,"The presence and type of mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene were determined in 40 patients undergoing curative hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal carcinoma. This represents the largest series in the literature on the screening of p53 mutations for liver metastases. The analysis was performed in exons 5-9 by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis followed by direct sequencing. Forty-five percent of tumors showed mutation in p53, and this was observed only in exons 5-8. Mutations at codon positions 167, 196, 204, 213, 245, 281, 282, 286, and 306; deletion of codon 251 and of the first nucleotide of codon 252; and Leu residue (CTC) insertion downstream codon 252 are reported for the first time in colorectal liver metastasis. Mutations at codon positions 163, 248, and 273 have been reported previously. Correlation of p53 status with clinical parameters showed that patients with mutated p53 had a statistically higher number of lesions when compared with patients with wild-type p53 (P<0.050). In particular, of patients with mutated p53, 41% had three or more metastases compared with 14% of patients with wild-type p53. Synchronous metastases were present in 70% of the patients with p53 mutations and in only 29% of patients with wild-type p53 (P<0.025). In addition, patients with p53 mutations are more likely to develop recurrence (73%) compared with patients with wild-type p53 (33%; P<0.001). Other factors considered, including preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level, bilobar distribution, and size of the lesion(s), did not show significant correlation with p53 status. These results suggest that p53 status might be an important prognostic indicator to predict the pattern and likelihood of treatment failure after hepatic resection."
CD011134,0,10576653,0,Dosimetric evaluation and radioimmunotherapy of anti-tumour multivalent Fab' fragments.,"We have been investigating the use of cross-linked divalent (DFM) and trivalent (TFM) versions of the anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monoclonal antibody A5B7 as possible alternatives to the parent forms (IgG and F(ab')2) which have been used previously in clinical radioimmunotherapy (RIT) studies in colorectal carcinoma. Comparative biodistribution studies of similar sized DFM and F(ab')2 and TFM and IgG, radiolabelled with both 131I and 90Y have been described previously using the human colorectal tumour LS174T nude mouse xenograft model (Casey et al (1996) Br J Cancer 74: 1397-1405). In this study quantitative estimates of radiation distribution and RIT in the xenograft model provided more insight into selecting the most suitable combination for future RIT. Radiation doses were significantly higher in all tissues when antibodies were labelled with 90Y. Major contributing organs were the kidneys, liver and spleen. The extremely high absorbed dose to the kidneys on injection of 90Y-labelled DFM and F(ab')2 as a result of accumulation of the radiometal would result in extremely high toxicity. These combinations are clearly unsuitable for RIT. Cumulative dose of 90Y-TFM to the kidney was 3 times lower than the divalent forms but still twice as high as for 90Y-IgG. TFM clears faster from the blood than IgG, producing higher tumour to blood ratios. Therefore when considering only the tumour to blood ratios of the total absorbed dose, the data suggests that TFM would be the most suitable candidate. However, when corrected for equitoxic blood levels, doses to normal tissues for TFM were approximately twice the level of IgG, producing a two-fold increase in the overall tumour to normal tissue ratio. In addition RIT revealed that for a similar level of toxicity and half the administered activity, 90Y-IgG produced a greater therapeutic response. This suggests that the most promising A5B7 antibody form with the radionuclide 90Y may be IgG. Dosimetry analysis revealed that the tumour to normal tissue ratios were greater for all 131I-labelled antibodies. This suggests that 131I may be a more suitable radionuclide for RIT, in terms of lower toxicity to normal tissues. The highest tumour to blood dose and tumour to normal tissue ratio at equitoxic blood levels was 131I-labelled DFM, suggesting that 131I-DFM may be best combination of antibody and radionuclide for A5B7. The dosimetry estimates were in agreement with RIT results in that twice the activity of 131I-DFM must be administered to produce a similar therapeutic effect as 131I-TFM. The toxicity in this therapy experiment was minimal and further experiments at higher doses are required to observe if there would be any advantage of a higher initial dose rate for 131I-DFM."

CD011134,0,10560426,0,[A long-term surviving case of multiple metastatic liver tumors from rectal cancer treated with microwave coagulation therapy (MCT)].,"We experienced a long-term surviving case from excellent control of a multiple metastatic liver tumor from rectal cancer. The patient was a 38-year-old male, and his chief complaint was pain at defecation. The primary lesion was diagnosed as rectal cancer (Rb), and it was histologically found to be well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The preoperative enhanced CT demonstrated 8 metastatic lesions in bilateral lobes of the liver. Low anterior resection for rectum and open microwave coagulation therapy (MCT) for liver metastasis were synchronously performed. The coagulated areas after MCT revealed no enhancement. The serum CEA levels returned to normal for 9 months. Nine months after the first operation, we detected 6 recurrent lesions in the other sites of the remnant liver. We used second open MCT because the hepatic arterial chemotherapy was ineffective. We performed percutaneous MCT for the next new lesions. The patient was diagnosed with lung metastasis 2 years after the first operation, and died of cancer growth 2 years and 9 months after the first operation. This long-term surviving case of nine metastatic liver tumors achieved adequate quality of life by a combination therapy mainly consisting of MCT."
CD011134,0,10554319,0,Tumor angiogenesis predicts recurrence with normal serum carcinoembryonic antigen in advanced rectal carcinoma patients.,"Many studies have established the usefulness of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) oriented serial monitoring for predicting recurrence and prognosis; however, few studies have so far investigated serum CEA-negative recurrence. The aim of this study was to elucidate the nature of CEA-negative recurrence regarding tumor angiogenesis. Fifty-seven patients with T3/T4 rectal cancer were divided into the two groups according to the serum CEA status. Angiogenesis was defined as the intratumoral vessel count by immunohistochemical staining using CD31. The CD31 count was significantly higher in the recurrent patients in both groups and the ratio of nodal involvement was significantly higher in the recurrent patients of the CEA-negative group. Local recurrence mainly developed in the CEA-negative group; however, the CD31 count did not predict the sites of recurrence nor the relapse period in the both groups. A multivariate analysis showed a high CD31 count >26) to be a prognostic factor not only for recurrence but also for survival (P = 0.001, 0.043, respectively). These results suggest that a high degree of tumor angiogenesis in sections of T3/T4 rectal cancer may therefore be an important predictor for CEA-negative recurrence."
CD011134,0,10541369,0,Radioimmunotherapy of small volume disease of colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver: preclinical evaluation in comparison to standard chemotherapy and initial results of a phase I clinical study.,"At the time of surgery, occult metastases (micrometastases) are present in more than 50% of colorectal cancer patients, and the liver is the most frequent site of apparent metastatic disease. Frequently, adjuvant chemotherapy is unable to prevent tumor recurrence. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are warranted. The aim of this study was to establish a model of human colon cancer metastatic to the liver of nude mice, to assess, in this setting, the therapeutic efficacy of radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) compared to standard chemotherapy and to evaluate, in a Phase I/II trial, the toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of RAIT in colorectal cancer patients with small volume disease metastatic to the liver. Multiple liver metastases of the human colon cancer cell line GW-39 were induced by intrasplenic injection of a 10% tumor cell suspension. Whereas controls were left untreated, therapy was initiated on day 10 or 20 after tumor inoculation with the 131I-labeled, low affinity anticarcinoembryonic antigen (anti-CEA) monoclonal antibody (MAb), F023C5 (Ka = 10(7) liters/mol), or the high-affinity anti-CEA MAb, MN-14 (Ka = 10(9) liters/mol), or chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (folinic acid) versus irinotecan) at their respective maximum tolerated doses (MTDs). Twelve colorectal cancer patients with small volume disease metastatic to the liver (all lesions < or = 2.5 cm) were entered into a mCi/m2-based Phase I dose escalation study with 131I-labeled humanized version of MN-14, hMN-14. The patients were given single injections, starting at 50 mCi/m2 and escalating in 10-mCi/m2 increments. The MTD was defined as the dose level at which < or = 1 of 6 patients develop grade 4 myelotoxicity. In the mice, untreated controls died from rapidly progressing hepatic metastases at 6-8 weeks after tumor inoculation. The life span of mice treated with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin was prolonged for only 1-3 weeks, whereas irinotecan led to a 5-8-week prolongation. In contrast, at their respective MTDs, the 131I-labeled low-affinity anti-CEA MAb, F023C5, led to a 20% permanent cure rate, and the high affinity MAb, MN-14, led to an 80% permanent cure rate, when therapy was initiated at 10 days after tumor inoculation. In the 20-day-old tumor stage, although it prolonged life, 131I-F023C5 was unable to achieve cures, whereas 131I-MN-14 was still successful in 20%. Histologically, no remaining viable tumor cells could be demonstrated in these animals surviving > 6 months. In patients, the MTD was reached at 60 mCi/m2 of hMN-14 (at 70 mCi/m2, two of three grade 4 myelotoxicities). Of 11 assessable patients, 2 had partial remissions (corresponding to an objective response rate of 18%), and 5 (45%) had minor/mixed responses or experienced stabilization of previously rapidly progressing disease. These data suggest that in small volume disease, RAIT may be superior to conventional chemotherapy. Antibodies of higher affinity seem to be clearly superior. The clinical response rates in patients with small volume disease are encouraging, being comparable to the response rates of conventional chemotherapeutic regimens but with fewer side effects. Ongoing studies will show whether treatment at the MTD will further improve therapeutic results."
CD011134,0,10533193,0,Immunoscintigraphy with 99Tcm-labelled monoclonal anti-CEA BW 431/26 antibodies in patients with suspected recurrent and metastatic colorectal carcinoma: two-year follow-up.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate immunoscintigraphy with BW 431/26 anti-CEA antibody in the follow-up of 15 patients with colorectal carcinoma. A whole-body scan followed by SPET imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed 4-6 and 20-24 h after the intravenous infusion of 0.6-1.0 mg of intact anti-CEA monoclonal BW 431/26 antibody labelled with 814-1110 MBq of 99Tcm. The HAMA response and serum CEA levels were determined. Immunoscintigraphic findings were verified by biopsy, radiologically and/or by 2 year follow-up. On an individual patient basis, immunoscintigraphy demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 100%, accuracy of 87%, positive predictive value of 100% and negative predictive value of 60%. Better results were achieved in the pelvic region than in the liver or in the extra-hepatic abdominal region. We evaluated 40 lesions; on an individual lesion basis, immuno-scintigraphy gave a sensitivity of 80% and an accuracy of 80%. SPET images detected significantly more lesions than whole-body planar images (P < 0.05). SPET at 20-24 h detected significantly more 'hot' lesions than at 4-6 h (P < 0.01). No correlation between CEA serum levels and immunoscintigraphy was observed (r = 0.376, P > 0.05). One of nine patients (11%) developed HAMA after immunoscintigraphy. We conclude that immunoscintigraphy with BW 431/26 antibody appears able to differentiate between tumour recurrence and scar tissue, and to evaluate liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. Serum CEA levels appear not to influence the result of immunoscintigraphy and the HAMA response is minimal. A delayed SPET scan should be part of an immunoscintigraphic imaging protocol when 99Tcm-labelled BW 431/26 monoclonal antibody is used."
CD011134,0,10528904,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen screening: pros and cons.,"The appropriate use of plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in the management of patients with colorectal cancer has been debated over the last 30 years. It is clear from the very low sensitivity of this test in normal populations that there is no role for CEA assessment as a screening tool for colon cancer. Although in patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic colon cancer, elevations of CEA generally indicate disease progression, while decreases are indicative of improvement, there is no convincing evidence that CEA monitoring significantly affects either survival or quality of life. The area of most interest for CEA monitoring has been the potential for its use after curative resection. The purpose of postoperative CEA monitoring would be to detect recurrence of cancer at an early, surgically curable stage. There is good evidence that routine CEA monitoring postresection of colon cancer detects metastatic disease on average 5 months before routine follow-up evaluation without CEA monitoring detects recurrence. Also, studies demonstrate that some patients with recurrent cancer detected by CEA monitoring may be cured by surgical resection of metastases. However, the overall cost-effectiveness of this approach is not clear, and convincing definition of the role of postoperative CEA monitoring awaits the results of large randomized clinical trials."

CD011134,0,10481530,0,Clinico-pathological characteristics of colorectal cancer and serum anti-p53 antibodies.,"The purpose of this study was to correlate the presence of p53 antibodies in sera of patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma with size, site and stage of the tumour, age and sex of a patient and the level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the serum. p53 antibodies were detected using enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Serum p53 antibodies were detected in 30 of 145 patients (21%), mostly in Astler-Coller stage B1 (28% of patients). No association was found between p53 antibody status in stage A+B1+B2 vs stages C1+C2+D (22% vs 19%) i.e. between patients without and with metastases to regional lymph nodes and/or distant metastases. Serum p53 antibodies were detected in 9 of 34 patients (26%) with tumour localised in the right part vs 21 of 109 patients (19%) with tumours in the left part of the colon and in 18 of 96 (19%) of patients with tumours localised in rectosigmoideum vs 12 of 47 (26%) with tumours in the remaining colon. There was no significant correlation between serum anti p53 antibody and CEA statuses. Increased level of serum CEA was seen in 46/145 (32%) patients. Patients with C1+C2+D stage cancers had high serum CEA level more frequently than did patients with A+B1+B2 stage tumours (44% vs 19% respectively, p < 0.001). Of 102 cases with normal CEA level, 19 (19%) were positive for anti p53 antibodies. These results together with the literature data [11, 20] indicate that approximately 27% CEA negative patients may have serum p53 antibodies. Therefore simultaneous assessment of serum p53 antibodies and CEA seems to be useful for monitoring high risk patients and for postoperative patient monitoring."

CD011134,0,10470177,0,"CA 242 in comparison with established tumour markers in colorectal, pancreatic and lung cancer.","In a prospective study (N = 566) we investigated the tumour associated carbohydrate-protein CA 242, focusing on the question whether CA 242 (CaNAG, Sweden) expression in carcinoma patients is distinctly higher than in benign disorders, especially when compared to CA 19-9 (EIA Roche Germany). A second point of interest was if CA 242 is expressed to a higher extent in early stages of colorectal cancer than CEA (MEIA Abbott, USA) and CA 19-9 are, and third its behavior in pancreatic and lung cancer. We found CA 242 values comparable in healthy individuals and benign gastrointestinal disorders, thus CA 19-9 remains the marker of first choice for pancreatic cancer and CEA for colorectal cancer. CA 242 shows no advantage in lung cancer as compared to the established markers (CEA, CYFRA 21-1 (EIA Roche Germany) and NSE (EIA Hoffmann LaRoche, Switzerland) and no clearly higher expression in early colorectal cancer. Overall, the combination of CEA and CA 242 shows the best sensitivity in colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,10470173,1,"CEA, TPS, CA 19-9 and CA 72-4 and the fecal occult blood test in the preoperative diagnosis and follow-up after resective surgery of colorectal cancer.","In a prospective clinical study we examined the diagnostic procedures used in the preoperative diagnosis of colorectal cancer patients (n = 176) and the value of supplementation of standard diagnostic methods (clinical investigation, colonoscopy, barium enema, ultrasound, computer tomography) with a test for occult fecal blood (FOBT) and an expanded tumor marker panel (CA 19-9, TPS and CA 72-4 in addition to CEA) in the postoperative follow-up (n = 116, mean follow-up 21 months). Preoperative diagnosis based on colonoscopy/barium enema, followed by histology and the imaging methods, in most cases US and/or CT. Patients with postoperative stage Dukes D and after palliative surgery were excluded from the follow-up study (n = 43). The patients were seen every three months (clinical investigation, US, CT, tumor markers, FOBT) within the first two postoperative years and every half a year thereafter. 83 of the 116 patients (16%) developed a recurrent disease and 5 of them could be reoperated with curative intention. In addition to the 19 patients 14 simultaneously admitted patients with recurrence of colorectal cancer (total n = 33) were studied. The results of our study analyzing the sensitivity and specificity of colonoscopy, tumor, markers and the FOBT in the preoperative and postoperative phases as well as in the diagnosis of recurrent disease of colorectal cancer confirms the view that FOBT and tumor markers cannot replace endoscopic and imaging methods. However they support the concept, that diagnosis and follow-up of colorectal cancer should be based on a combination of clinical investigation and imaging methods (US, CT etc. and endoscopic and/or x-ray examination) with supplementation by FOBT and determination of tumor markers, mainly CEA. In the case a patient is asking for prognostic and recurrence information as early and as valid as possible we currently recommend the following procedure for the first two years after surgery: every three months the determination of tumor markers, FOBT as well as ultrasound of the upper abdomen and CT of the lower abdomen and every half year a total colonoscopy. The question of whether this program will also have a therapeutical relevance depends on several factors like the personal experience and concepts of the consulting surgeons and oncologists and also on the tasks and duties which are considered worthy by the patient for his further life if confronted with the diagnosis of recurrent colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,10469401,0,Rectal adenocarcinoid with lymph node metastasis.,"We describe a case of a rare variant of a rectal carcinoid tumor that showed mucous gland differentiation accompanied by a lymph node metastasis with a histological appearance similar to that of the primary site. The tumor consisted of a typical argyrophilic carcinoid component and of goblet cell glands. The carcinoid component was positive for neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin A and synaptophysin. The goblet cells stained positively with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and alcian blue, and expressed carcinoembryonic antigen, but were negative for neuroendocrine markers. This case suggests that carcinoid tumor can differentiate towards mucus glands, which can also be found in the metastatic site."
CD011134,0,10436809,0,"Role of tumour markers, cytogenetics.","A review is presented on the role of conventional and molecular tumour markers (TM) in diagnosis and monitoring of patients with biliopancreatic malignancies. For biliopancreatic malignancy, following CEA as more historical and basic TM of gastrointestinal diseases, the mainstay marker is CA 19-9 as monosialo-ganglioside/glycolipid and sialyl derivative of lacto-N-fucopentaose II (sialyl-Lewis(a), hapten of human Lewis(a) bloodgroup determinant). It is detected in serum of healthy individuals at low concentration < 40 U/ml, with lower and often transitional elevation in benign hepatobiliary diseases and with highest levels in excretory ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma (s = 70%-95%, sp = 72%-90%), biliary (s = 55%-79%), hepatocellular and cholangiocellular cancer (s = 22%-51%) besides gastric, colorectal and ovarian cancer and occasionally in lung, breast and uterine cancer. Physiologically elevated concentrations in healthy individuals have to be considered in all sorts of secretions (e.g. sputum, saliva, bronchial/gastric secretions, bile juice) of individuals with Lewis(a)-positive secretor status in contrast with low or lacking serum levels of CA 19-9 in patients with Lewis(a-/b-) status (7%-10% of population). In biliopancreatic malignancies, especially pancreatic cancer, CA 19-9 correlates well with clinical course of disease following surgical, chemo- or radiotherapy by a quick normalisation within 2-4 weeks after complete surgery, a transient decrease with successful palliative therapy and an often anticipated increase (lead time up to 6 months) before clinical detection in case of relapse or progressive disease. From CA 19-9 related TM tests some are detecting in addition to sialyl-Lewis(a) (sialyllacto-N-fucopentaose II) also the non-fucosylated precursor sialyl-Lewis(c) (sialyllacto-N-tetraose: CA 50, CA 242, Span-1) solely detected by the DUPAN-2 test and independent of the Lewis(a) secretor status. Some other markers comprise in addition to sialyl-Lewis(a) partially the non-sialylated Lewis(a) antigen (CA 195, CAM 43, CA 494) or are less related (CAM 17.1). The initial phase of screening and early detection is hoped to be better assessed by using molecular markers detecting gene mutations (p53, K-ras), growth factors (EGF, TGF-alpha, TGF-beta, HB-EGF, a/bFGFs, KGF) and growth factor receptor alterations (EGFr, c-erbB2/3/4). From these, K-ras mutations detected in blood, stool and bile juice of patients at risk for pancreatic cancer seem to be more promising than p53 alterations as a more later step in carcinogenesis, although they are neither yet well established nor standardised by reliable assays. In contrast growth factor and growth factor receptor alterations mainly concerning signal transducing systems seem to reflect increased tumour aggressiveness, thus shorter survival and poorer prognosis thereby contributing in the selection of patients for more aggressive therapy."
CD011134,0,10431589,0,[Low-dose CPT-11 against a recurrent rectal cancer--a case report].,"We attempted a new regimen of low-dose CPT-11 on a 5-FU resistant recurrent rectal cancer patient with multiple lung metastases and a paraaortic lymph node metastasis. CPT-11 was administered at 25 mg/m2/day x 3/week by intravenous infusion. Serum CEA level decreased gradually with a half time of approximately 4 weeks. The lung metastases almost disappeared and the paraaortic lymph node was also reduced more than 50%. There were no adverse effects except slight alopetia. This treatment could be continued on an outpatient basis. These results suggest that low-dose CPT-11 may be more effective and tolerable than the conventional, CPT-11 therapy."
CD011134,0,10430334,0,"A case of colon cancer recurrence with P-glycoprotein treated by methotrexate, fluorouracil, and leucovorin.","A 68 year-old female underwent right hemicolectomy for an advanced cecum cancer and had been well without any evidence of recurrence for a year after surgery. Despite post-operative treatment with oral Tegafur (400 mg/m2/day), CEA level increased gradually beginning 15 months after surgery. Sequential chemotherapy with methotrexate (MTX) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), followed by leucovorin rescue (MFL) was started on an outpatient basis, and has been continued every 4 weeks since then. It consisted of MTX (100 mg/m2) and 5-FU (600 mg/m2) started 24 hours after MTX, followed by oral leucovorin (15 mg/body) started 30 hours after MTX 6 times at intervals of 6 hours. CEA level declined initially, but increased slowly for 3 years on MFL, although no evidence of recurrence was detected by imaging studies with computed tomography, ultrasound, and scintigram. Four years after surgery, a tumor recurrence developed in the abdominal wall. The patient underwent resection of the tumor, resulting in a decline of the CEA level. She has been alive and well for 5 years on MFL after the primary surgery. Both the original tumor and recurrent tumor showed immunoreactivity for P-glycoprotein. The present case demonstrates the feasibility of using MFL on an outpatient basis, and its potential to suppress the colon cancer growth with P-glycoprotein expression."

The initial pulmonary metastases were treated by pneumonectomy, but 32 months later the patient again showed a pulmonary metastasis. Thus, from July 1997, he was treated with 5'-DFUR (800 mg/day) + MMC (4 mg/2 weeks). After 3 months of therapy, the chest CT examination showed an extreme reduction of the pulmonary lesion, and at 5 months the lesion was even smaller. Presently, after 7 months of therapy, the lesion remains stable. His CEA level is 1.0-2.6 ng/ml.

CD011134,0,10370636,0,CEA and CA 19-9 as prognostic indexes in colorectal cancer.,"Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 are tumor markers expressed by colorectal cancers (CR), particularly in advanced cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of pre-operative elevated CEA and/or CA 19-9 levels for patients with CR. Blood samples were collected from 74 patients. CEA and CA 19-9 were determined by ELISA (normal range: 0-3 ng/ml for CEA and 0-37 U/ml for CA 19-9). All patients were followed-up for at least 30 months or until death. At the time of diagnosis, 42% of the patients had elevated serum levels of CEA and 35% of CA 19-9. Relapse was observed in 33 patients, 73% of whom had elevated CEA and/or CA 19-9 levels. Among patients without relapse, 68% and 73% had normal values of CEA and CA 19-9, respectively. Ninety-three percent of patients, who had CR recurrence during the first year, had an elevated CEA and/or CA 19-9 level, while 67% of the patients with CR after 1 year, had normal tumor markers. Elevated pre-operative serum CEA and CA 19-9 levels were each predictive of increased cancer mortality (p = 0.001 for CEA, p = 0.01 for CA 19-9). Raised CEA and CA 19-9 levels identify patients at high risk for CR and death and may be useful in selecting patients for adjuvant therapy."
CD011134,0,10370360,0,A thousand points of light or just dim bulbs? Radiolabeled antibodies and colorectal cancer imaging.,"Radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) is coming into its own as an imaging modality in clinical oncology. Early experience with indium-111-labeled intact murine monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) in colorectal cancer suggested that RIS images hepatic metastases poorly. Moreover, an antimurine immune response was frequently provoked, precluding multiple follow-up RIS studies in individual patients due to reticuloendothelial sequestration of the radioimmunoconjugate before tumor targeting could occur. Recent trials of technetium-99m-labeled antibody fragments and human MoAbs have demonstrated significant improvement in imaging efficacy, and repeated or serial imaging is possible because of the absence of associated immunogenicity. RIS is demonstrably more sensitive than conventional diagnostic modalities (CDM) such as computed tomography (CT) for detection of extrahepatic abdominal and pelvic colorectal carcinoma and is complementary to CDM in imaging liver metastases. In a surgical decision-making analysis comparing CT, RIS (IMMU-4 99mTc-Fab'; CEA-Scan), and CT plus RIS in patients with recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer, CT plus RIS improved correct prediction of resectability by 40% and correct prediction of unresectability by 100% compared with CT alone. At the present time, RIS used in combination with CDM contributes an incremental improvement in diagnostic accuracy in colorectal cancer patients with known or suspected recurrent disease. Basic and clinical research currently in progress promises to yield agents and methods that provide rapid high-resolution imaging, high tumor-to-background ratios in all organs at risk for tumor recurrence or metastasis, negligible immunogenicity and toxicity, and a significant further improvement in the accuracy of clinical decision making in oncology patients."
CD011134,0,10366210,0,Surgical experience with hepatic colorectal metastasis.,"The outcome of 134 patients undergoing hepatic resection for colorectal metastasis was studied. Current follow-up was available in 98 per cent of patients, for more than 5 years in 58 patients, and totaling 360 patient-years. Patients (52% male) had an average age of 62 +/- 1 years (standard error of the mean). Time lapse between the primary colon surgery and hepatic resection was a median of 16 months and a mean of 19 +/- 1 months. Thirty-two (24%) were operated on within 6 months for both their primary tumor and hepatic metastasis. Intensive care unit and total hospital length of stay were a median of 1 and 7 days, respectively. Pathology reports demonstrated that on average there were 2.0 +/- 0.1 lesions, with the largest lesion measuring 4.4 +/- 0.2 cm. In 72 per cent of patients, the lesions were found in one lobe only. CEA was elevated in 83 per cent of patients preoperatively and was 60 +/- 11 ng/mL before and 4.0 +/- 0.5 ng/mL after hepatic resection. Patient survival was 81 per cent at 1 year, 50 per cent at 3 years, 36 per cent at 5 years, and 23 per cent at 10 years. Actual 5- and 10-year survival was 22 of 58 (38%) patients and 4 of 21 (19%) patients respectively. Disease-free survival was 58 per cent at 1 year, 27 per cent at 3 years, 16 per cent at 5 years, and 12 per cent at 7 years. Survival was much better for one to four lesions than for five or more lesions (P < 0.01). Several other potential risk factors did not affect survival, including whether the patient received chemotherapy after hepatic resection. There were 36 (43%) patients who recurred with hepatic involvement only, 27 (32%) including hepatic involvement and 21 (25%) with nonhepatic involvement only. There were 15 patients who went on to receive repeat hepatic resections, with a 5-year survival of 74 per cent and disease-free survival of 58 per cent. Hepatic resection provides the best outcome of any form of therapy for selected patients with isolated hepatic metastasis."

Intravenous chemotherapy using 5-fluorouracil and CDDP was repeated bimonthly for 7 months; however, his condition deteriorated progressively. External beam radiotherapy (50 Gy) was started thereafter. His serum carcinoembryonic antigen level decreased promptly and abdominal computed tomography showed apparent shrinkage of the metastatic pelvic node with calcification. The patient maintained a partial response for at least 12 months. Radiotherapy has a more crucial role in the treatment of a subgroup of recurrent colorectal tumors."
CD011134,0,10337667,0,Cardiac myxoma with glandular component: case report and review of the literature.,"A 7 cm diameter tumor of the left atrium is reported in a 78 year-old woman with a past history of pT3N1M0 colonic adenocarcinoma. The histological examination of the atrial tumor disclosed areas of highly vascularized myxoid stroma with cells strongly reactive for vimentin. Multiple mucoid spaces lined by a single layer of goblet cells were scattered among those typical areas of myxoma. No nuclear atypia was observed. Cytoplasm of the glandular cells was immunoreactive for epithelial antisera (keratin, EMA), CEA and CA19.9. Two years later, the patient was doing well, with no local recurrence of the cardiac myxoma and no secondary location of the colonic adenocarcinoma. The histological characteristics, the absence of atypia, the absence of tumoral extension or neoplastic lymphatic vascular thrombi in the pedicle or in the interatrial septum, and the finding of typical myxomatous areas supported the diagnosis of cardiac myxoma with glandular component. To our knowledge, 21 cases of myxoma with glandular mucinous component, focal or prominent, have been previously published in the literature. These myxoma were generally sporadic cases with the same clinical features and prognosis as typical myxoma. Immunoreactivity of these glandular structures was constant for epithelial markers. The positive immunostaining by CEA, and by CA19.9 in our case, reflects the histogenetic endodermal origin."

CD011134,0,10207736,1,Carcinoembryonic antigen: its value in the follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer.,"We examined the value of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monitoring for detecting treatable recurrence of colorectal carcinoma. CEA assays were undertaken in 193 patients over a 2-year period. The levels in 34 patients were raised in one or more assays above the laboratory-defined upper limit of normal; 31 cases were reviewed retrospectively. In 10% of patients there were Dukes' A lesions at the initial resection, in 39% Dukes' B, and in 52% Dukes' C1 or C2. Tumours were rectal in 61%. Median follow-up was 3 years (range, 16 years-2 months). In 23 of 31 (74%) there were symptoms or signs of recurrent disease prior to or simultaneously with an observed rise in CEA; in 8 the CEA rise preceded the onset of symptoms or the appearance of signs. Of the 31 cases 26 underwent investigation for recurrent disease, but in only 6 of these was the investigation driven by the observed rise in CEA rather than the onset of symptoms or presence of signs. Three of these six were false-positive results (50%), one has been lost to follow-up, and two had confirmed recurrence. Neither of the two with recurrence had operable disease. One of the two had no further treatment, and one underwent laparotomy at which multiple peritoneal seedlings were found. In both of the two cases going to laparotomy, one of which was prompted by a high CEA, widely disseminated disease was found. Over a 2-year period, serial CEA measurement thus yielded no patient benefit."
CD011134,0,10188896,0,Serum YKL-40 and colorectal cancer.,"YKL-40 is a mammalian member of the chitinase protein family. Although the function of YKL-40 is unknown, the pattern of its expression suggests a function in remodelling or degradation of extracellular matrix. High serum YKL-40 has been found in patients with recurrent breast cancer and has been related to short survival. In the present study we analysed YKL-40 in preoperative sera from patients with colorectal cancer and evaluated its relation to survival. Serum YKL-40 was determined by RIA in 603 patients. Survival after operation was registered, and median follow-up time was 61 months. Three hundred and forty patients died. Sixteen per cent of the patients with Dukes' A, 26% with Dukes' B, 19% with Dukes' C and 39% with Dukes' D had high serum YKL-40 levels (adjusted for age). Analysis of serum YKL-40 as a continuous variable showed an association between increased serum YKL-40 and short survival (P < 0.0001). Patients with high preoperative serum YKL-40 concentration had significantly shorter survival than patients with normal YKL-40 (HR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3-2.1, P < 0.0001). Multivariate Cox analysis including serum YKL-40, serum CEA, Dukes' stage, age and gender showed that high YKL-40 was an independent prognostic variable for short survival (HR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.8, P = 0.007). These results suggest that YKL-40 may play an important role in tumour invasion."

This combination therapy was safely carried out on an outpatient basis. The degrees of recovery of the left lower limb pain and edema, and of serum CEA reduction were comparable to those in high-dose chemotherapy alone. No significant adverse effects were encountered in the thermo-chemotherapy attempted. Since hyperthermic treatment enhances the cytotoxic effects of CPT-11 in vitro, topical hyperthermia with low-dose CPT-11 therapy may produce a response comparable to that in high-dose CPT-11 chemotherapy alone. However, an optimal dose and comparative study with other chemotherapeutic agents would be needed.

CD011134,0,10027321,0,Marimastat in recurrent colorectal cancer: exploratory evaluation of biological activity by measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen.,"Marimastat is a specific inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases that has been shown to be effective in cancer models. A pilot, escalating-dose study of oral marimastat was performed in patients with recurrent colorectal cancer, in whom evaluation of serological response was made by measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. The study assessed the safety and tolerability of 4 weeks administration of marimastat, and determined a dose range producing detectable serological effects. Patients were recruited with a serum CEA level greater than 5 ng ml(-1), and rising by more than 25% over a 4-week screening period. Patients were treated for 28 days and entered into a continuation protocol if a serological response or clinical benefit was observed. Pharmacokinetic and safety data determined that groups of patients were recruited sequentially at 25 mg and 50 mg twice daily, and, thereafter, 10 mg twice daily, 10 mg once daily, 5 mg once daily and 20 mg once daily. A biological effect (BE) was defined as a CEA value on day 28 no greater than on day 0; a partial biological effect (PBE) was defined as a rise in CEA over the 28-day treatment period of less than 25%. Of 70 patients recruited, 63 completed the 28-day treatment period, and 55 were eligible for cancer antigen analysis. Examination of the dose-effect relationships provides evidence for a causal relationship between marimastat and biological effects: the proportion of patients with BE or PBE was higher with twice daily dosing (16 out of 25, 64%) than with once daily dosing (11 out of 30, 37%) (P = 0.043, chi2 test). Furthermore, the median rates of rise of CEA fell markedly during treatment compared with the screening period for patients receiving twice daily marimastat (P<0.0001), but not for patients receiving marimastat once daily (P = 0.25). Musculoskeletal adverse events emerged as the principal drug-related toxicity of marimastat, occurring in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. It was concluded that marimastat was associated with dose-dependent biological effects in cancer patients. The occurrence of musculoskeletal side-effects define 25 mg twice daily as the upper limit of the dose range for continuous use in further studies. Therefore, a dose range of 20 mg once daily to 25 mg twice daily seems appropriate for further studies, which should aim to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug in terms of conventional clinical end points and describe the long-term tolerability of this novel agent."

In patients who had undergone a curative resection of Dukes' C colorectal cancer, the sensitivity of NCC-ST-439 in the sera for recurrent disease was 71.4% and specificity was 95.2%. The results of a preliminary study suggested NCC-ST-439 to be a novel marker for predicting recurrence after a curative resection of Dukes' C colorectal carcinoma."

Of the 90 patients considered initially only 33% was admitted to radical surgical treatment, after a complete clinical and instrumental evaluation. Twenty of them was affected by liver metastases, most of which from colo-rectal cancer; ten had hepatocellular carcinoma developed on hepatic cirrhosis. All the patients affected by HCC underwent pre-operative chemoembolisation (TACE). Regional chemotherapy (TACI) was performed in synchronous metastatic tumors before surgical treatment. Surgical resection in HCC was extremely limited, removing at most 35% of total liver volume. For metastatic tumors 12 major resections and 8 minor resections was carried out. Postoperative complications occurred in 13.3%, including one death for digestive bleeding. A relationship between intraoperative risk factors, such as blood loss and transfusions was registered. The actuarial surviving rate was 47.5% for HCC and 48.3% for colo-rectal metastases at three years. Finally, preoperative CEA levels was the only factor significantly related to long term prognosis of patients affected by liver colo-rectal metastases."
CD011134,0,9974027,1,[The pre- and postoperative monitoring of the immunological indices and tumor markers in colorectal carcinoma].,"The onset of immunological reaction against colorectal carcinoma is based on superficial changes in the malignant cell components following the formation of antigen structures. This explains the interest in the issue and defines the aim of the study. Over a 5-year period, in the Emergency Surgery Clinic, 86 patients with histologically diagnosed colorectal carcinoma (46 men and 40 women) are examined prior to surgery, and 107 patients (55 men and 52 women)--after the operation. The tumor markers CEA, CA 19-9, AFP and immunoglobulin IgA are tested using ELISA and RIA methods. Conventional ultrasound, scintigraphic and CT studies are carried out to detect liver metastases. The obtained results undergo statistical processing with correlation analysis and sensitivity and specificity coefficients. Among those examined preoperatively elevated CEA levels (CEA > 2.5 ng/ml) are recorded in 42 cases (48.9%), and for CA 19-9 (CA 19-9 > 37 E/ml)--in 40 (46.5%). From the patients with complicated colorectal carcinoma in the postoperative period 83 are clinically healthy (77.6%); of the latter marker-positive are 16 (19.3%), and marker-negative--67 (80.7%). Relapses and metastases are registered in 24 cases (22.4%) of which marker-positive--19 (79.2%). Liver and abdominal lymph node metastases are detected by US, scintigraphy and CT study. All three imaging methods contribute to diagnose liver metastases in 14 patients (13%). In 32 patients (18 men and 14 women) postsurgical monitoring of immunological IgA levels and tumor markers is done over period ranging from 7-10 days to 2 years postoperatively. Correlative dependences between IgA and CEA (R = +0.99), and between IgA and CA 19-9 (R = +0.97) are also documented. The sensitivity of both markers (CEA and CA 19-9) is low, varying between 38 and 51 per cent, with specificity amounting to 61-67 per cent. The paradoxically high elevation of tumor markers prior to operation shows a constant decrease at 3 months after surgery."
CD011134,0,9872539,1,Monitoring carcinoembryonic antigen in colorectal cancer: is it still useful?,"The results of a study conducted to determine the usefulness of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monitoring in the follow-up of patients with resected colorectal cancer are reported herein. The subjects of this study were 125 patients in whom CEA had been determined preoperatively and 239 patients in whom CEA had been monitored postoperatively. The results revealed increased preoperative CEA in only 24% of the subjects, and that this increment was correlated with subsequent more advanced tumor stage and a higher recurrence rate (P < 0.01). The postoperative CEA level exceeded the threshold in 71% of the patients affected by recurrence, 94.4% of whom developed liver metastases and 50%, nonhepatic recurrence. This marker showed elevated sensitivity for liver metastases (99%), whereas the sensitivity was lower for nonhepatic recurrence of the disease (94%). Thus, we concluded that CEA monitoring can be useful for preoperative colorectal tumor grading, even if its validity in the early diagnosis of recurrence is problematic, especially in terms of radical repeated surgery and survival."

Sixteen asymptomatic patients with an history of colorectal cancer surgery underwent second-look surgery using the RIGS system, solely on the basis of rising serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). All patients were injected preoperatively with the anti-tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG) 125I-labeled MoAb B72.3. Both traditional and RIGS exploration were used to determine the extension of a possible recurrence and its resectability for cure. Recurrent disease was observed in 14 of the 16 patients as the result of this combined exploration. Exploration alone showed the presence of recurrent disease in 9 of 16 patients (56.2%). Thus, RIGS found overlooked tumor in five patients (31.2%). All the additional RIGS-detected tumor sites were locoregional recurrences resectable for cure; conversely, no diagnostic improvements were shown in patients with liver metastases. Resection for cure was obtained by this approach in 9 of 16 patients (56.2%). Two patients without disease at the exploratory laparotomy recurred within 2 months at sites away from the abdomen. RIGS improved the results of colorectal cancer CEA-guided second-look procedures in asymptomatic patients by recruiting one-third of patients to curative resections."

The patients were preoperatively injected with 1 mg of FO23C5 (anti-CEA) and/or B72.3 anti-tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG-72) biotinylated MAb; after 24 hours, 1 mg of avidin was administered, and, after a further 24 hours, biotin labeled to Indium-111 (In111) was injected. Preoperative imaging was obtained by means of a gamma camera, and a portable gamma-detecting probe (Neoprobe 1000) was intraoperatively used to count tumor and surrounding normal tissue. Eight tumor sites were localized in the six patients. Four lesions were identified preoperatively and six intraoperatively with a mean tumor-to-normal-tissue (T/NT) ratio of 1:8. This method allowed preoperative scintigraphy and intraoperative radioimmunodetection to be performed with a single radioactive compound injection of biotin labeled to In111 within few days before surgery."
CD011134,0,9829378,0,Radioimmunoguided surgery with different iodine-125 radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies in recurrent colorectal cancer.,"Sixty-four patients with recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer underwent radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS). Thirty patients (Group A) were preoperatively injected with radiolabeled monoclonal antibody (MAb) B72.3, a whole IgG1 that reacts with tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG-72) antigen. Thirty-four patients (Group B) were given monoclonal antibody FO23C5, an F(ab')2 which reacts with the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The use of F(ab')2 antibodies ensured a lower time interval from the preoperative injection of the radiolabeled MAb to surgery. This interval was 22.7 days for Group A patients and 10.9 days for Group B patients. The correct RIGS identification of tumor sites occurred in 80.4% of Group A patients and in 92.6% of Group B patients. Additional information capable of modifying surgical strategy was obtained in 23.3% of Group A patients and in 8.8% of Group B patients. This difference was due to the different patterns of biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of the two MAbs. Although FO23C5 yields an improved diagnostic resolution for macroscopic tumor sites, we believe that B72.3 or other whole IgG1 should be the first choice for RIGS in recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer patients."

Radioactivity is detected at the presurgical stage by immunoscintigraphy and intraoperatively with a gamma-detecting probe (GDP). In our experience, intraoperative tumor-to-normal-tissue (T/NT) GDP ratio counts > or =3:1 were considered positive radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) findings. We studied 52 colorectal cancer patients, 48 with primary lesions and 7 with relapses. Positive RIGS findings were obtained in 33 patients whose lymph node assessments were characterised by eight false positive identifications. In 10 patients, RIGS data yielded a more accurate staging of the disease. Unreliable RIGS findings were recorded in 15 patients: four injected with monoclonal antibody (MAb) B72.3 labeled with Iodine-125; five with MAb anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) labeled with 99mTechnetium (Tc); two with MAb B72.3 labeled with Indium-111; and three with MAb B72.3 labeled with Iodine-131 plus interferon-beta.

In a last paper 21% of the colorectal cancer patients treated surgically had not recurrent disease. The aim of the study was to follow these patients for at least one year. Thirty two patients with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen serum levels were studied. Five were excluded and 27 were followed with chest RX, computadorized tomography and colonoscopy. Carcinoembryonic antigen serum levels were measured by ELISA using Sorine Biomedica kit (normal value: 5 ng/ml). Eleven patients (41%) developed recurrence, seven had liver metastasis. The mean time among the elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen and the recurrence was 6.6 months. The recurrence was not observed in 18 patients, the carcinoembryonic antigen serum levels become normal in eight and in the eight others the carcinoembryonic antigen serum levels persisted elevated.

Subsequently, CEA was detected in the circulation of patients and recognized as a serum marker for colorectal cancer. In the early diagnosis of disease recurrence following surgical resection, a serial increase in CEA level is the first evidence of tumor. In patients with disseminated tumors, serial determinations are useful for monitoring response to therapy. Carcinoembryonic antigen values decrease with effective treatment, while they increase with disease refractory to therapy or progressive metastases, yet the utility of CEA in the management of patients with advanced colorectal cancer remains controversial."

The mean LAP scores of the metastatic cancer patients (261, 272 and 275 for breast, ovary and colon, respectively) were significantly higher than those of the nonmetastatic cancer group (70, 68 and 57, respectively). There was no overlap between the 95% confidence intervals of the two groups (i.e., metastatic versus nonmetastatic), and no patient known to be metastatic had a LAP score within the normal range. The mean levels of other markers in the metastatic patients (CA15-3, 63.4 mu/ml; CA125, 104.8 mu/ml; and CEA, 51.8 ng/ml for metastatic breast, ovarian, and colon cancer, respectively) were also higher than in the nonmetastatic patients (CA15-3, 24 mu/ml; CA125, 25.3 mu/ml; and CEA, 5.8 ng/ml for nonmetastatic breast, ovarian, and colon cancer, respectively). However, the 95% confidence intervals of the nonmetastatic and the metastatic patients overlapped so that there were false-negatives and/or false-positives when the other markers were used.

E7010 exhibits a broad spectrum of antitumor activity against human tumor xenografts. The mechanism of action is by arresting the progression of cells in M phase of the cell cycle by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. The objective of this phase I study was to determine the maximum allowable dose (MAD), toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of single or 5-day repeated doses of E7010. In the single-dose study, E7010 was administered orally to 16 patients at doses ranging from 80 to 480 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxicity was peripheral neuropathy at a dose of 480 mg/m2. Hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities were mild. In the 5-day repeated-dose study, 41 patients were given E7010 at doses ranging from 30 to 240 mg/m2 per day. The dose-limiting toxicities were peripheral neuropathy and intestinal paralysis. Gastrointestinal toxicity was dose-dependent but not severe. Hematological toxicity was not dose-dependent. Pharmacokinetic analysis in the single-dose study showed a rapid increase in the plasma levels of the drug after administration, followed by disappearance with a t1/2 of 4.4-16.6 h. The variation in area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) between the patients was small and increased in a dose-dependent manner. Total drug recovery in urine 72 h after administration was 77.8+/-11.4%, indicating that E7010 has favorable absorption and elimination profiles. The changes in the plasma levels of E7010 on day 5 in the 5-day repeated-dose study were almost the same as those on day 1, indicating that the drug did not accumulate. In the single-dose study, spinal cord metastasis exhibited a 74% reduction in a patient with uterine sarcoma and a minor response (MR) was observed in a pulmonary adenocarcinoma patient. In the 5-day repeated-dose study decreases in the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) were observed in a patient with stomach cancer and in a patient with recurrent uterine cervical carcinoma, respectively. The recommended phase II doses are 320 mg/m2 for a single-dose study and 200 mg/m2 per day for a 5-day repeated-dose study. Since the activity of E7010 is time-dependent, i.e. a certain concentration of E7010 is required for more than 12 h to suppress the growth of P388 leukemia cells, it is recommended that subsequent phase I/II studies be conducted using a divided dose schedule in order to maintain the blood level of E7010."

This is certainly the case for liver metastases of colon cancer. Surgical resection of localised liver metastases has a 25-30% 5-year survival. Early chemotherapy for non-resectable metastatic disease improves the survival and prolongs the symptom-free period in comparison with chemotherapy starting at the onset of symptoms. Follow-up for colorectal cancer should be offered to patients with the highest risk of recurrence and should consist of clinical examination, CEA monitoring, ultrasound of the liver, chest X-ray and periodic colonoscopy.

Case 1 was a 60-year-old female who received sigmoidectomy with partial hepatectomy, and intraarterial 5-FU infusion was done after surgery. One year later, recurrence of liver tumor was detected, and PEI and PAI were performed for the metastatic lesions of the liver. Tumor regression and histopathological examination revealed coagulative necrosis. The patient died of lung metastasis 2 years and 10 months after treatment. Case 2 was a 58-year-old-male with ascending colon cancer and liver metastasis, who received surgery, and chemotherapy with intraarterial 5-FU infusion was continued. Four months later, recurrence of liver metastasis with elevation of serum CEA was noted. The patient received PEI three times and CEA decreased. Re-operation of hepatectomy revealed complete necrosis at the site of PEI. The patient has been alive for 1 year and 6 months with a new recurrence in the liver and is receiving repeated PEI therapy.

CD011134,0,9544234,0,The multi-epitope approach for immunotherapy for cancer: identification of several CTL epitopes from various tumor-associated antigens expressed on solid epithelial tumors.,"One approach to development of specific cancer immunotherapy relies on the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for tumor-associated antigens (TAA). Induction of TAA-specific CTL could be used towards the eradication of established tumors, or to prevent their dissemination or recurrence after primary treatment. The present study identifies a set of CTL epitopes from TAA frequently found on solid epithelial tumors such as breast, lung and gastro-intestinal tumors. Specifically, HLA-A2.1 binding peptides from the MAGE2, MAGE3, HER-2/neu and CEA antigens were tested for their capacity to elicit in vitro anti-tumor CTL using lymphocytes from normal volunteers and autologous dendritic cells as antigen-presenting cells. A total of 6 new epitopes (MAGE2[10(157)], MAGE3[9(112)], CEA[9(691)], CEA[9(24)], HER2[9(435)] and HER2[9(5)]) were identified which were capable of specifically recognizing tumor cell lines lines expressing HLA-A2.1 and the corresponding TAA. In one case (CEA[9(24)]), induction of vigorous anti-tumor CTL responses required epitope engineering to increase HLA-A2.1 binding affinity. Finally, most of the newly identified epitopes (5 out of 6) were found to be highly crossreactive with other common HLA alleles of the A2 supertype (A2.2, A2.3, A2.6 and A6802), thus demonstrating their potential in providing broad and non-ethnically biased population coverage. The results are discussed in the context of the development of multi-epitope-based therapies with broad applicability for patients suffering from commonly found tumors."

CD011134,0,9494419,0,Resection of colorectal liver metastases: 25-year experience.,"The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze survival and prognostic factors in 111 consecutive patients undergoing curative resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer. In addition, the time periods 1971-1984 and 1985-1995 were compared; criteria for first liver resection did not change with time, whereas the attitude toward re-resection was more aggressive during the latter period. Operative mortality was 6% during 1971-1984 and 0% during 1985-1995 (3.6% for all patients). The crude 5-year actuarial survivals were 19% and 35% for patients operated during 1971-1984 and 1985-1995, respectively (25% for the whole period). Relapse at any site was observed in 52 patients (81%) operated during the first period and in 29 patients (67%) operated during the second period; re-resection was performed in 12 (23%) and 15 (52%) of these patients, respectively. Five-year survival after hepatic re-resection was 29% (no operative mortality). In the univariate analysis, significant determinants for long-term survival were, in descending order, a clear resection margin, high degree of fibrosis around the tumor, absence of extrahepatic metastases (including metastases to the liver hilum), use of an ultrasound dissector, low preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, year of resection (1985-1995), and low/moderate grade of liver tumor. There were no 5-year survivors when extrahepatic metastases were present, the liver tumor(s) had a low differentiation or satellites, or the resection margin was involved with tumor. In the multivariate analysis, the determinants were grade of liver tumor, absence of extrahepatic tumor, few intraoperative blood transfusions, low preoperative serum CEA level, and year of resection (1985-1995). It is concluded that: (1) an increased rate of hepatic re-resection was partly responsible for the improved outcome after liver resection for colorectal metastases during recent years; (2) patients with extrahepatic metastases did not benefit from liver resection; and (3) surgery should be performed with a clear resection margin and minimal blood loss."
CD011134,0,9492886,0,Treatment of colorectal liver metastases by cryotherapy.,"One hundred fifty-eight procedures were performed on 136 patients with unresectable hepatic metastases using hepatic cryotherapy to ablate the tumors. The median age was 62 years. Patients included 90 males and 46 females. Fifty-eight patients had synchronous metastases, 55 had bilobar lesions, and 90 had precryo chemotherapy. Median preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was 14.4 ng/dl. The numbers of lesions treated, frozen, and resected were two and one. Median survival of all patients was 30 months. Survival for 39 patients was 37 months. Patients with a CEA level > 100 ng/dl had a statistically worse survival rate than those with a level < 100 ng/dl (P < .001). Twenty patients underwent recryotherapy with median survival of 34 months. Recurrent disease developed in 78% of patients--82% of the patients developed liver recurrence. Complication rates were comparable to liver resection. Operative mortality was 3.7%. Hepatic cryotherapy is effective and safe in treating colorectal hepatic metastases under ultrasound guidance."

The anastomotic recurrence was found in 11 patients (33.3%), peri-anastomotic in 14 cases (42.4%) and distant in 8 patients (24.3%). The authors emphasise the value of air insufflation in visualising the anastomotic segment and thickness of intestinal walls.

CD011134,0,9815809,0,Clinical and immune responses in advanced colorectal cancer patients treated with anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody vaccine that mimics the carcinoembryonic antigen.,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is expressed in a wide variety of adenocarcinomas, and it is well recognized that cancer patients are immunologically ""tolerant"" to CEA. The purpose of this study was to determine whether we could break immune tolerance to CEA by vaccinating patients with a monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody that is the internal image of CEA and to determine what impact this might have on patient survival. Twenty-four patients with advanced CEA-positive colorectal cancer who failed standard therapies except for two were entered into this Phase Ib trial. One patient was considered not assessable, because on the day of entering into the study, she was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia. Patients were treated with 1, 2, or 4 mg of aluminum hydroxide-precipitated 3H1 anti-idiotype antibody every other week for four injections and then monthly until tumor progression was observed. Immunological monitoring included humoral and cellular idiotypic and CEA responses, and all patients were evaluated for toxicity, response, and survival. Hyperimmune sera from 17 of 23 patients demonstrated an anti-anti-idiotypic Ab3 response, and 13 of these responses were demonstrated to be true anti-CEA responses (Ab1'). The antibody response was polyclonal, and 11 mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Ten patients had idiotypic T-cell responses, and five had specific T-cell responses to CEA. None of the patients had objective clinical responses, but overall median survival for the 23 evaluable patients was 11.3 months, with 44% 1-year survival (95% confidence interval, 23-64%). Toxicity was limited to local swelling and minimal pain. Anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody 3H1 that mimics CEA was able to break immune tolerance in the majority of treated patients. Overall survival of 11.3 months was comparable to other phase II data with advanced colorectal cancer patients treated with a variety of chemotherapy agents, including irinotecan, with considerably less toxicity. Although it is not clear that the vaccine itself had an impact on survival, this should be determined in a Phase III randomized trial."
CD011134,0,9640796,1,CEA as a prognostic index in colorectal cancer.,"The carcinoembryonic antigen, CEA, is the tumor marker most used in colorectal patients, principally during follow up after radical surgery. High serum CEA level before surgery is often associated with worse prognosis, in some studies."
CD011134,0,9484923,0,Surveillance after colorectal cancer surgery.,"Early diagnosis of local and distant recurrences of colorectal cancer remains difficult and there is no agreement on the effectiveness of follow-up in these patients. The aim of this study is to assess the value of our method of follow-up. We consider 239 patients with colorectal cancer and at least 2 years follow-up following radical resection. A local recurrence appeared in 26 patients (10.9%), a distant metastasis in 41 (17.1%), while in seven (2.9%) local and distant recurrences appeared simultaneously. Local recurrence was detected because of an increase in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level in 15 patients (57.7%), during a scheduled endoscopy in four (15.4%) and because of symptoms in seven (26.9%). In seven patients (26.9%) a radical resection was possible. Distant metastases were detected by CEA levels in 20 patients (48.8%), by ultrasonography (U.S.) in 12 (29.3%) and by chest X-ray in five (12.2%). In 13 of 26 patients with liver metastases a resection was performed. This study shows that few patients benefit from follow-up and only CEA levels and liver U.S. performed intensively between 15 and 36 months after surgery are useful in early detection of recurrences. A modification of the follow-up to the single patient, according to the stage, location and grading of cancer, could improve the results, so lowering the costs of this expensive practice."
CD011134,0,9470809,0,Plasma sialic acid as a marker of the effect of the treatment on metastatic colorectal cancer.,"The concentration of total sialic acid (TSA) is increased in the plasma of patients with many types of cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of the TSA marker in predicting the efficacy of the treatment, and to compare TSA with two common markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9). The study was performed on 44 patients treated for advanced colorectal carcinoma by a weekly 8 h continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (1300 mg/m2) plus bolus injection of L-folinic acid (100 mg/m2). TSA, CEA and CA 19-9 levels were measured before and after 3 months of treatment and their variations analysed as a function of the response to the treatment. TSA levels of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma before treatment (959 +/- 265 mg/l) were significantly higher than those of 32 healthy people (584 +/- 99 mg/l). The percentage of patients with TSA concentration above the cut-off level (782 mg/l) was 73% before treatment and 23% after. All patients who experienced an objective response to the treatment (complete, partial or minor response) (n = 29) had a significant decrease of TSA levels (t = 5.96; P < 0.001). When the disease was considered as stabilised (n = 10), TSA changed slightly, but it increased with progressive disease (4 out of 5 patients). Changes in CEA and CA 19-9 did not correlate as well as TSA to the treatment efficacy. Initial levels of TSA did not permit prediction of the efficacy of the treatment since they were not significantly different between the five response groups. TSA seems to be more likely involved in tumour changes than in tumour volume. Its determination could provide useful information about the spreading and metastatic properties of the tumour. TSA normalisation is an indicator of probable tumour growth arrest and its elevation could be a marker of relapse."
CD011134,0,9458953,0,[Carcinoembryonic antigen in diagnosis and monitoring of colorectal cancer].,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels in the diagnosis and in monitoring colorectal cancer patients at different Dukes' stage. Carcinoembryonic antigen serum levels were measured by Elisa using Sorine Biomedica kit (normal value: 5 ng/ml) in 240 colorectal adenocarcinoma. In the diagnosis, carcinoembryonic antigen levels were measured in 109 patients, in 42% of them, the carcinoembryonic antigen levels were elevated. The carcinoembryonic antigen levels were also evaluated in 309 serum from treated colorectal cancer patients. Fifty-nine percent of the serum of the patients with recurrence disease had elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels and 41% of the serum of patients without recurrence also have elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels. Ninety percent of the serum from treated patients without recurrence have normal serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels. We concluded that the sensitivity of carcinoembryonic antigen is lower in the diagnosis as described in others studies, mostly in patients with better prognosis. In the monitoring, patients with normal serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels, probably have no recurrence of the disease. In the other hand, patients with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels can have or not relapsed disease."

CD011134,0,9411673,0,[After-care of colorectal carcinoma: what has efficacy?].,The efficacy of standardized follow-up examinations after surgery for colorectal carcinoma has been repeatedly questioned. Although many studies have assessed the value of different diagnostic tools none of these procedures proved to have a predictive value high enough to accurately predict the recurrence of disease and to justify its regular use in these patients. Even a combined diagnostic approach provided a benefit only for a minority of these patients (3.5 to 4.5%). Considering the physical and psychological strain imposed by this approach risk-adapted follow-up schemes are urgently needed. Prognostic parameters indicating the individual risk for disease recurrence can be deduced from increasing CEA values as well as from classification and grading of the primary tumor. Colonoscopy is an effective procedure for early detection of intraluminal relapse or metachronous tumors with potential impact on survival of the patient. An abdominal ultrasound study appears to be the method of choice for detection of metastasis of the liver due to its high sensitivity and low invasiveness. Other imaging procedures are not indicated in routine follow-up for colorectal carcinoma. It remains to be demonstrated whether molecular biology or new scintigraphic techniques will be helpful in follow-up examinations of patients with colorectal carcinomas.

CD011134,0,9393570,0,The use of biliary CEA measurements in the diagnosis of recurrent colorectal cancer.,"To assess the usefulness of biliary CEA determinations in the diagnosis of recurrent tumour, gallbladder bile was sampled in patients who underwent laparotomy for proven or suspected recurrent colorectal cancer and in control patients. Biliary CEA concentrations in controls were < 5 ng/ml, whereas significantly elevated CEA concentrations were found in the bile of all patients with tumour recurrence. Serum concentrations in these patients were elevated in 77% only. In a series of 12 patients with (a) suspicious lesion(s) on liver imaging but normal serum CEA concentration during follow-up, biliary CEA determination differentiated clearly between metastases and benign lesions. Biliary CEA determination seems to aid detection of tumour recurrence at an early stage and may preclude unnecessary surgery in patients with undefined liver lesions."

CD011134,0,9382525,0,[A new two-part therapy for multiple bilobar liver metastases of colorectal cancer--treatment of one lobe with partial hepatectomy and the other with arterial chemotherapy].,"We studied a new two-part therapy for patients of multiple (more than five) bilobar liver metastases from colorectal cancer, in which one lobe is treated with partial hepatectomy and the other with arterial chemotherapy. The patient was a 72-year-old woman who had undergone sigmoidectomy and partial hepatectomy on March 9, 1995, for advanced sigmoid cancer with liver metastasis. In December 1995, new foci were detected in the remaining liver. Intraoperative echography during reoperation revealed 6 foci in the right lobe, 2 in the left lobe and 1 in the caudate lobe. During reoperation, we performed partial hepatectomy at the left lobe metastases and microwave coagulation in the caudate lobe. A catheter was inserted into the right hepatic artery, and the right hepatic artery was ligated with the catheter. From 2 weeks after operation, CDDP (20 mg) and 5-FU (1,500 mg) were given weekly by infusion from the arterial root. As a result, the serum CEA level fell to 3.6 ng/ml on June 26, 1996, and 1.9 mg/ml on August 14, 1996. A right lobectomy would have been performed if no metastasis appeared in the remainder of the left lobe over a one-year period. However, no foci were detected on a CT scan on March 26, 1997. This new two-part therapy warrants detailed investigation for bilobar bilateral liver metastases of colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,9382505,0,[Arterial infusion chemotherapy in pelvic space for advanced rectal cancer].,"Three rectal cancer patients were treated with arterial infusion chemotherapy through the internal iliac artery. Two patients with pelvic recurrences unresectable after APRA were treated with intensive chemotherapy and the other patient with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In all cases, 5-FU (500 mg/ body/day) was administered continuously for 5 days or 14 days. We attempted three methods for this procedure which were a bilateral catheterization to the internal iliac artery, a single catheterization with an embolization to the other internal iliac artery and a single catheterization without the embolization. As the result of this treatment, in the resected specimen with neoadjuvant case, histological necrosis was found in 50% in the main tumor and the metastatic lymph nodes. One patient with pelvic recurrence showed a partial response in CT imaging, but died one year later of the recurrence around the external iliac artery. The other patient with pelvic recurrence treated with the bilateral catheterization had no efficacy on CT imaging, but his CEA level has decreased at present. It was concluded that arterial infusion chemotherapy was effective for advanced rectal cancer and the pelvic recurrences. However, the efficacy of this treatment is limited to the area to which the drugs are delivered. Thus, it is important that the method and the location of the catheterization are determined adequately for each case."
CD011134,0,9378784,0,[Role of imaging in abdominopelvic follow-up after resection of colorectal cancer].,"The imaging techniques used to follow-up patients submitted to surgery for colorectal cancers are presented as are their advantages and disadvantages. The sensitivity of ultrasonography (US) for postoperative surveillance of the liver varies considerably according to whether the absence or presence of metastases is sought (83%) or their exact number (53-82%). US is recommended by French clinicians as the standard follow-up examination whereas, American clinicians tend to discuss CT-Scan or MRI for the same purpose. Some authors advocate Doppler ultrasonography for the detection of liver metastases. Spiral CT-Scan offers better results than conventional CT and is now considered second in rank to US for follow-up studies. Its sensitivity exceeds 90% for metastases greater than 1 cm. IRM and arterial CT-scan are not applicable for follow-up but are sometimes indicated for difficult cases before hepatectomy. US is also an appropriate technique for postoperative exploration of the abdominal cavity. When the CEA level and the US examination are normal, this technique is sufficient. However, in dubious clinical or biological cases, US should be associated with a spiral CT-Scan. Most clinicians recommend a reference CT-Scan, two to four months after the resection and every 6 months for 2 years and then annually. The same follow-up strategy is advocated after abdominoperineal resection and for surveillance of the pelvis. The sensitivity of CT-Scan is between 69 and 88% but it is unable to differentiate recurrence from fibrosis. IRM, with a sensitivity of 90%, is the best method for overcoming with problems related to the differential diagnosis and particularly novel fast acquisition imaging and contrast agents. Ultrasonoendoscopy, repeated every 4 to 6 months after anterior resection, is also a useful examination for surveillance of the pelvis. PET-Scan has produced encouraging results for the detection of metastases and for the differential diagnosis between local recurrence and fibrosis. When available, this technique could become the ""gold standard"" for the surveillance of patients following surgery for colorectal cancers."

CD011134,0,9342635,0,Histopathological and prognostic evaluation of immunohistochemical findings in colorectal cancer.,"Many immunohistochemical studies have investigated the relationship between immunohistochemical characteristics and histopathological findings in colorectal tumors. One of the most extensively studied markers has been tissue CEA, although the prognostic significance of this and other antigens is still uncertain. The authors report results relative to three tumoral antigens (carcinoembryonic antigen, CEA; tissue polypeptide antigen. TPA, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, CA 19-9) determined by immunohistochemical methods in tissue samples of 52 colorectal carcinomas. The relationship between the immunohistochemical characteristics of the neoplasms and the clinicopathologic parameters, as well as their influence on the prognosis of the patients, were examined. Positive CEA reaction has a significant relationship with grade of differentiation of the tumor while diffuse cellular expression of this antigen often indicates neoplasms extending beyond the intestinal wall and invading the lymph vessels. The number of tissue antigens expressed is significantly related to the extent of tumor spread through the intestinal wall. A greater incidence of recurrence and shorter disease-free interval and survival were observed in neoplasms that expressed tissue TPA antigen or more than one tissue antigens. In the present study the latter parameter has demonstrated to have independent prognostic significance for the disease-free interval. Immunohistochemical evaluation of antigens in colorectal carcinoma tissue shows a possible independent prognostic value of the antigenic heterogeneity of tumors, which could be related to their different biological behavior."
CD011134,0,9340857,0,[Follow up after potential curative surgery of colorectal cancer. Guidelines from the Norwegian Gastrointestinal Cancer Group].,"In Norway, about 2,800 cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed every year. Two-thirds of the patients undergo potentially curative surgery and almost half of them develop local or distant metastases. The follow-up of colorectal cancer patients involves four strategies: Educating the patients about the disease, symptoms of relapse, and risk of hereditariness; Early diagnosis of relapse, to make curative re-surgery possible; Diagnosis of metachronous/synchronous cancer(s); Recording the results of current surgical techniques. The Norwegian Gastrointestinal Cancer Group recommend a four-year follow-up programme (every third month for two years and then twice a year) of colorectal cancer patients. It is suggested that patients treated with low anterior resection are followed regularly by means of rectoscopy and local examination (digital or by ultrasound) undertaken by specialist (surgeon or gastroenterologist). The others should be followed up mainly by general practitioners. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-monitoring is suggested every third month for two years, and then every sixth month. Colonoscopy is recommended at one and four year follow-up. Patients with normal CEA levels prior to surgery should be evaluated by ultrasound of the liver every sixth month for four years."

We wanted to investigated whether there is a difference in concentration between patients with and without recurrence of cancer. During the follow-up period 14 of 38 patients showed tumor recurrence. The patients with cancer relapse had higher preoperative serum levels of CEA and CA19-9 and in the histologically normal colonic mucosa they had higher concentrations of CEA, CA19-9, SCC and low CA15-3. The highest values of CEA, CA19-9, and SCC occurred in the mucosa of patients developing local cancer recurrence. Marker concentrations in tumor tissues themselves did not differ between patients with or without tumor relapse. Though confirmation in a larger number of cases is needed we conclude from these results that tumor marker concentrations in the healthy colonic mucosa of patients with colorectal cancer may become valuable indicators of the risk of tumor recurrence."
CD011134,0,9309885,0,[Preoperative evaluation of cancers of the rectum].,"The diagnosis of colorectal cancer must be considered in the presence of suggestive symptoms and must be endoscopy. Assessment of operability, including chest x-ray, is completed by CEA determination and x-rays of the colon, looking for a synchronous lesion. Complementary assessments must answer 3 questions: what operation needs to be performed, is any preoperative adjuvant treatment indicated, do any prognostic factors need to be identified before the operation. The treatment of cancer of the colon is now clearly defined; intraoperative hepatic ultrasonography and histological examination of the resection specimen provide all of the necessary data in the majority of the cases. In the presence of a cancer of the rectum, various therapeutic alternatives are available according to the site and stage of the tumour. The complementary assessment includes biopsy to confirm the malignant nature of the lesion, and measurement of the distance of the lower pole from the anal margin (digital rectal examination, endoscopy). A more precise preoperative staging by ultrasonography, computed axial tomography or magnetic resonance is required when the clinician considers that the invasive nature of the lesion justifies preoperative radiotherapy. This precise staging is fully justified in the presence of a small rectal tumour amenable to local resection. Although infiltration of the rectal wall is now very clearly defined, formal identification of metastatic lymphadenopathy still remains hazardous. Finally, the search for distant metastases by invasive and/or expensive techniques is indicated when looking for contraindications to surgery (high-risk patients, surgery for recurrence and metastases). In other cases, the presence of metastases does not contraindicate a palliative colonic resection and intraoperative exploration allows reliable identification of any liver metastasis."

The clinicopathologic factors studied for prognostic value were age, tumor location, tumor differentiation, preoperative serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, Dukes' stage, and IVase activity in colorectal cancer tissue. IVase activities in colorectal cancer tissue were significantly higher in the group of patients with recurrences than in the group without recurrences (P = 0.019). Patients with high IVase activity in colorectal cancer tissue had a significantly shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.0016) and overall survival (P = 0.022) time than those with low IVase activity. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that significant prognostic factors for disease-free survival were Dukes' stage (P = 0.029, P = 0.046, respectively) and IVase activity status (P = 0.0016, P = 0.0026, respectively). With respect to overall survival, only IVase activity status provided significant predictive value in multivariate analysis (P = 0.041). This prospective study suggests that IVase activity is a valuable prognostic factor in colorectal cancer patients."

In July 1994, the CEA level elevated, and be was diagnoted as having para-aortic LN swelling and stenosis of anastomosis of colon. He was admitted for treatment of recurrent colon cancer. Initially, he was treated with continuous injection of 5-FU, low-dose CDDP and Leucovorin. His CEA level decreased and para-aortic LN diminished in size. But, in December 1995, the CEA level and para-aortic LN relapsed. 5-FU, CDDP and Leucovorin were administered, but the CEA level became more and more elevated. This regimen was not considered responsible for drug resistance. CPT-11 was administered at 60 mg/week 6 times, and 80 mg/week 3 times. The side effects disappeared, LN sightly diminished in size, and the CEA level decreased. Judging by the anticancer effect without severe side effect, we found CPT-11 a useful drug for second-line chemotherapy."
CD011134,0,9273809,0,[Probe-guided surgery of colorectal carcinoma].,"Anti-CEA-scintigraphy turned out very reliable in detecting primary and recurrent colorectal cancer, its overall accuracy being more than 90 p.c. The intraoperative application of this technology should provide similar results when focussing at extrahepatic tumor deposits, for example in lymph nodes, thus allowing accurate staging of the underlying disease. To test this hypothesis we lauched the following feasibility-study the results of which are compared to those reported in the recent literature. We investigated 20 patients-six with rectum-, 14 with colon cancer, 24 hours before surgery they were intravenously given 1 ml of an fab-fragment-antibody to CEA, labeled with 25mCi of 99mTc (CEA-Scan). During surgery the radioactivity in lymph glands regionary for the tumors was measured and compared to the-much lower-activity in healthy nodes. For this we used a scintillation-probe (C-Trak). All lymph nodes of interest were-then excised and submitted to frozen section pathology. In 7/20 cases scintimetry led to an up-staging of the disease. In addition we found metastatic spread to lymph nodes that were basically not regionary for the primary tumor. Our results are confirmed by those of other investigators. Scintimetry can precisely identify even very small tumor deposits. So it leads to accurate staging when surgery is still on-going. In a next step the concept of sentinel-node-diagnosis, which is right now being clinically evaluated, may be applied is colorectal surgical oncology."

The biodistribution and imaging characteristics of indium-111-labeled (111-In)-mAb CEA102 were studied in 1 primary and 9 extrahepatic recurrent intestinal carcinoma patients. Evaluation included antibody pharmacokinetics and assessment of antibody distribution in surgical specimens, in comparison with whole body imaging using a gamma camera, and imaging with single photon emission computed tomography. Selective mAb CEA102 localization to tumor tissue was demonstrated in 7 patients with tumors over 2 cm in size, and the external images correlated well with the results of surgical inspection, pathological examination, and tissue radioactivity measurements. Tumor:serum ratios ranged from 0.20:1 to 3.22:1, and serial biodistribution study of ""regions of interest"" also demonstrated a high radioactivity in the tumor.

We wanted to investigate whether there is a difference in concentration between patients with and without recurrence of cancer. During the follow-up period 14 of 38 patients showed tumor recurrence. Patients with cancer relapse had higher preoperative serum levels of CEA and CA19-9 and significantly higher concentrations in their histologically normal colonic mucosa of CEA, CA19-9, SCC and lower ones of CA15-3. The highest values of CEA, CA19-9, and SCC occurred in the mucosa of patients developing local cancer recurrence.

CD011134,0,9251889,0,The prognostic importance of tumor markers in adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract.,"Although no serological tumor marker has yet been shown to be sufficiently sensitive and specific to be used in screening for colorectal, gastric, or pancreatic cancers, elevated pre-operative levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 correlate with advances stages of disease and a poorer clinical outcome. Monitoring of serum carcinoembryonic antigen after primary resection of colorectal cancer may identify a small percentage of asymptomatic patients with recurrent disease who are amenable to a second surgical procedure with curative intent. A new class of tumor markers that recognize cytokeratins, which comprise the intermediate filaments of the cytoskeletons of epithelial cells, is being evaluated as a prognostic factor in colorectal and gastric cancer. Elevated mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in tumor tissue compared with normal intestinal mucosa predicts for a poor prognosis after primary management of colorectal cancer. CA 19-9, CA 72-4, and CYFRA 21-1 may convey prognostic information in gastric cancer. CA 19-9 appears to be the best overall tumor marker for pancreatic cancer, and a subsequent rise after postoperative normalization may precede clinical detection of recurrent disease. CAM 17.1 is a new marker that has similar sensitivity but better specificity than CA 19-9 in pancreatic cancer. The utility of serial monitoring of these tumor markers in patients with advanced disease is less well established but may become helpful if more effective systemic therapy is developed."

Thirty-eight patients were studied and compared with 22 patients with elevated CEA levels. The overall sensitivity of CEA for the diagnosis of recurrence was 36%. Postoperative CEA was strongly influenced by the site of recurrence. CEA monitoring showed the best results in patients who developed hepatic metastases (sensitivity 60%, specificity 94%, positive predictive value 60%, and negative predictive value 94%), and was ineffective for the detection of locoregional or pulmonary metastases. The results indicate that elevation of CEA in the postoperative course of these patients is an indicator of the presence of hepatic metastases. Postoperative CEA monitoring should not be omitted in Dukes C patients with normal preoperative levels, and is more reliable for the detection of liver metastases."

A positive CA19-9 slope was noted in 15.1% of the patients, and a positive CEA slope was noted in 19.5%. No clear-cut correlations were observed between the slopes of the two markers. The slopes of the CA19-9 and CEA correlated with both recurrence and survival. Measuring the slopes of the CA19-9 and CEA concentrations makes it possible to differentiate local from distant recurrences in patients with colorectal cancer.

Eight patients had primary and six recurrent colorectal cancer. Three different monoclonal antibodies were used included B72.3, recognizing TAG72 antigen, FO23C3 and FO23C5 directed against two epitopes of CEA. The antibodies were labeled with 125I. During surgery the radioactive emission of tumour and normal tissue was evaluated by a gamma detecting probe. Ten patients showed positive intraoperative results and in particular 6 (75%) of the 8 patients with primary tumour and 4 (67%) of the 6 patients with recurrence, with a mean tumour to normal tissue ratio of 2.2. Intraoperative radioimmunodetection was instrumental in modifying the therapeutic approach in two patients with recurrent cancer but in none of the patients with a primary presentation. Immunohistochemical analysis, to evaluate TAG72 and CEA antigen expression, was performed in 13 cases. CEA antigen was expressed in 8/13 cases and TAG72 in 5/13. Thus the sensitivity was 38.5% and 61.5% with B72.3 and anti-CEA monoclonal antibodies respectively, while in combination the sensitivity was 71.4%.

Ninety-four patients who underwent curative surgery were enrolled and 24 patients (25.5%) had recurrence during the follow-up period (median: 30 months, range: 2-69 months). T1/2 of CEA for all patients ranged from 1.2 days to 88.1 days, with a median of 4.4 days. T1/2 of CEA (mean +/- standard deviation) was 11.7 +/- 17.9 days in recurrent patients, whereas it was 6.2 +/- 4.9 days in patients without recurrence (p = 0.0224). The patients' age, gender, size of the tumor, location of the tumor, pre-, and postoperative CEA level, pathologic type of the tumor and Dukes stage had no significance in recurrence. The 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 95.1%, 81.1%, and 73.8% in patients with postoperative CEA levels less than 5 ng/ml (n = 62), respectively, and 71.4%, 64.8%, and 64.8% in patients with postoperative CEA levels higher than or equal to 5 ng/ml (n = 32), respectively (p = 0.04). Patients were divided into Group S (T1/2 of CEA < 4.4 days, n = 43) and Group L (T1/2 of CEA > or = 4.4 days, n = 51). The 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 95.3%, 85.1%, and 77.7% in Group S, respectively, and 80%, 67.5%, and 64.1% in Group L, respectively (p = 0.0261). In conclusion, the disease-free survival of colorectal cancer patients was prolonged in patients who had a short T1/2 of CEA or a low level of postoperative CEA. In high-risk colorectal cancer patients with an abnormally high level of preoperative CEA, recurrence may be predicted by checking an early postoperative CEA level and/or by a simple calculation of the actual half life of CEA."

There were seven men and two women, mean age 52 (range 34-75 years). Duke's stages of the primary cancer were B1 in two patients, B2 in one patient, and C2 in six patients. Most of the patients had elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and constitutional symptoms as indications for the second-look procedure. There was one surgical death due to hepatic failure in a patient who required a trisegmentectomy. The average interval between the first and second hepatic resections was 21 months. The estimated 1- and 5-year actuarial survivals from the second liver resection were 78% and 23%, respectively. The median survival was 41 months from the first resection (range 14-100 months) and 16 months from the second resection (range 0-92 months).

Significant morbidity was observed in 16% of patients with a decrease to 7% for the last 4 years. A 99.5 percent follow-up until January 1, 1996, was achieved. Excluding operative mortality there are 376 patients with ""potentially curative"" initial liver resection, and 65 corresponding patients with minimal macroscopic (n = 19) or microscopic (n = 46) residual disease. The latter group demonstrated a poor prognosis with median and maximum survival times of 14.8 and 56 months, respectively. Among the 376 patients having potentially curative resection the actuarial five, ten, and twenty year survival was 39 +/- 3, 26 +/- 5 and 21 +/- 13 percent, respectively. Tumor-free survival was 34 +/- 3 percent at 5 years. In the univariate analysis, the following factors were associated with decreased crude survival: Presence and extent of mesenteric lymph node involvement (p = 0.0001), poor grading of the primary tumor (p = 0.008), synchronous diagnosis of metastases (p = 0.004), satellite metastases (p < 0.0001), an increasing metastasis diameter (p < 0.0001), preoperative CEA elevation (p = 0.0002), a resection margin of less than 1 cm (p = 0.018), extrahepatic disease (p = 0.02), non-anatomical procedures (p = 0.008), and an operative blood loss exceeding 2.000 ml (p = 0.02). With respect to disease-free survival, extrahepatic disease (p = 0.09) failed to achieve statistical significance, while patients with colon cancer and with delayed resection of synchronous metastases did significantly better than those with rectal cancer (p = 0.02) and with a simultaneous procedure (p = 0.04), respectively. Multiplicity and bilobar involvement did not affect prognosis. Similarly, no significant predictive value of an increasing number of metastases (1-3 vs > or = 4) on either overall (p = 0.35) or disease free survival (p = 0.55) was found after a radical excision of all detectable disease. Using Cox's multivariate regression analysis, presence of satellite metastases, anatomical vs non-anatomical approach, primary tumor grade and diameter of the largest metastasis all independently affected both crude and tumor-free survival (p < 0.05). With respect to survival, this was complemented by the margin of clearance (0.05 < p < 0.1), while for disease-free survival primary tumor site and time of metastasis diagnosis had some additional influence. Twenty-six patients with R0-reresection of the liver, and 32 patients with radical excision of extrahepatic recurrent disease had a subsequent 5-year survival of 57 +/- 15 percent and 32 +/- 12 percent, respectively. This confirms the effectiveness of a close follow-up policy."
CD011134,0,8953601,0,NCCN Colorectal Cancer Practice Guidelines. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network.,"In summary, the committee believes that a multidisciplinary approach is necessary for the management of the patient with colorectal cancer. The committee endorses the concept that treatment of patients on a clinical trial has priority over standard or accepted therapy. The recommended surgical procedure for managing resectable colon cancer is an en bloc resection; laparoscopic surgery should be done only in the context of a clinical trial. For patients with stage III disease, 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended. A patient who has metastatic disease in the liver or lung should be considered for surgical resection if he or she is a candidate for surgery and if surgery can extend survival. The committee advocates a conservative post-treatment surveillance program for colon and rectal cancer patients. A determination of CEA should be done only if CEA was elevated at baseline and decreased following primary resection. Abdominal and pelvic CT scans should be utilized only when there are clinical indications of possible recurrence. Patients whose disease progresses during 5-FU-based therapy should be considered for treatment with irinotecan or encouraged to participate in a phase I or II clinical trial."

CD011134,0,8912535,0,"Preparation, characterisation and tumour targeting of cross-linked divalent and trivalent anti-tumour Fab' fragments.","The monoclonal anti-CEA antibody, A5B7, has previously been administered to patients for radioimmunotherapy (RIT). Long circulation time and the formation of an immune response have limited therapeutic success in the clinic. Antibody fragments can be used to reduce the in vivo circulation time, but the best combination of fragment and radioisotope to use for therapy is far from clear. In this study we have compared the biodistribution of A5B7 IgG and F(ab')2 with chemically cross-linked divalent (DFM) and trivalent (TFM) A5B7 Fab' fragments in nude mice bearing human colorectal tumour xenografts. The cross-linkers were designed to allow site-specific labelling using yttrium 90 (90Y), a high-energy beta-emitter. We have also compared the above antibody forms conjugated to both 131I and 90Y. Both DFM and TFM were fully immunoreactive and remained intact after radiolabelling and incubation in serum at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Biodistribution results showed similar tumour uptake levels and an identical blood clearance pattern for F(ab')2 and DFM with high tumour-blood ratios generated in each case. However, unacceptably high kidney accumulation for both F(ab')2 and DFM and elevated splenic uptake of DFM labelled with 90Y was observed. Kinetic analysis of antigen binding revealed that DFM had the fastest association rate (kass = 1.6 x 10(5) Ms-1) of the antibody forms, perhaps owing to increased flexibility of the cross-linker. This advantage implies that DFM may be more suitable than F(ab')2 radiolabelled with 131I for RIT. TFM cleared from the blood significantly faster than A5B7 IgG when labelled with both 131I and 90Y, producing an improved therapeutic tumour-blood ratio. Kidney accumulation was not observed for [90Y]TFM, but a slightly higher splenic uptake was observed that may indicate reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake. Overall, tumour uptake was higher for 90Y-labelled antibodies than for 131I-labelled antibodies. Because of the faster clearance, it should be possible to administer a higher total dose of 90Y-labelled TFM than IgG, which is attractive for RIT. Both A5B7 DFM and TFM, therefore, show favourable properties compared with their parent antibody forms."

Biodistribution in mice and clinical studies were undertaken to assess the potential of these two ligands in the detection of colorectal adenocarcinoma recurrences and metastases in humans. Toxicity studies were carried out on guinea pigs and Swiss mice injected with a dose proportionally 100 times greater than that used in human studies. Clinical studies were performed in patients with clinically and/or biologically suspected adenocarcinoma recurrences. No immunoconjugate-induced toxicity was found. The biodistribution studies in mice gave better visualization of tumour sites with 111In-F6-SCN and 111In-F6-4-ICE than with 111In-F6-DTPA. Ten patients were included in the clinical protocol. 111In-F6-SCN and 111In-F6-4-ICE effectively visualized adenocarcinoma recurrences. However, in this small series, 111In-F6-4-ICE performed somewhat better than 111In-F6-SCN. The present study has demonstrated the potential of new bifunctional semi-rigid chelating agents coupled to antibody and labelled with 111In to localize recurrences (especially in liver) in humans using a one-step targeting method."

The positive rates for serum CYFRA21-1 were 34.6% in primary colorectal cancer. There was a significant correlation between the positive rates of serum CYFRA21-1 and liver metastases, peritoneal dissemination, lymph node metastases, or clinical stage. The survival rate for patients in the CYFRA21-1 positive group was lower than those with CYFRA21-1 negative group. Among patients who underwent curative operation, patients is the CYFRA21-1 positive group gave a recurrence rate of 26.6%, against 9.4% in the CYFRA21-1 negative group. There was no correlation between serum CYFRA21-1 levels and serum CEA levels. These findings suggest that Serum CYFRA21-1 levels may be a useful indicator in estimating the prognosis for colorectal cancer."

Regular postoperative monitoring after resection by conventional imaging techniques and carcinoembryonic antigen levels aids physicians in identifying such tumor recurrences. However, some recurrences might elude detection by bone scan, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, and newer tests such as immunoscintigraphy using radioimmune-tagged monoclonal antibodies may be more diagnostic. Here we report a case, presenting with delayed recurrence at a rare bony site, in which application of immunoscintigraphy helped in the definitive detection of the tumor recurrence."

CD011134,0,8867343,0,[Prognostic factors in local recurrence rate after surgical therapy of rectal carcinomas].,"From January 01, 1985 to December 31, 1993 515 patients with primary rectal cancer underwent operative treatment at the hospital of general and abdominal surgery of the university of Mainz. In 294 patients with conventional surgical treatment and R0-resection of the tumor we investigated the influence of tumor-, patient- and therapeutic factors on local tumor recurrence. At a univariate analysis the following factors were significant: UICC-staging (p = 0.001), pT-classification (p = 0.001), pN-classification (p = 0.013) and localisation of the tumor (p = 0.013). These results could be verified for the pT-classification and pN-classification in a multivariate analysis. The significant influence of operative treatment (p = 0.034), blood transfusion (p = 0.018) and preoperative raised CEA (p = 0.026) depended on significant differences of UICC - staging and tumor - localisation of the different groups. Grading, sex and age had no influence. Inspite of a shift of local resurrence from 13% to 50% (0% to 42.9% for resections, respectively 6.7% to 55.4% for exstirpations) we could not find a significant influence of the surgeon. This fact depended on the dividing of a small number of cases on a lot of surgeons. In our opinion the influence of the surgeon or of different hospitals on local recurrence should be investigated in further studies."
CD011134,0,8849951,0,Peritoneal carcinomatosis and radioimmunoguided surgery.,"The Radioimmunoguided Surgery (RIGS) system was developed, in part, to detect occult tumor in patients with recurrent colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, however, patients are sometimes found to have unresectable peritoneal metastasis. For these patients, intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion (IPHP) with mitomycin C (MMC) was used as a novel treatment method. Thirty-six intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusions with MMC were given over the course of several studies. A preliminary study delineated two groups as possible candidates for this treatment: patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei and patients with peritoneal metastasis < 0.5 cm. Intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion (IPHP) was conducted for 1 hour after achieving an abdominal temperature of 41 degrees C. A dose of 30 mg MMC in 31 Plasmalyte was injected followed by a second 30 mg dose given at 30 minutes. Plasma pharmacokinetics of IPHP with MMC indicate an advantage in the range of 100-fold enhancement of exposure compared with delivery in plasma. The method was found to be safe when flow was observed and dosage decisions were made during perfusion according to flow. A clinical study group consisting of 15 patients underwent cytoreductive surgery followed by IPHP. The majority of them had either gastrointestinal or urologic anastomoses. There were no complications. In every patient the CEA level decreased after surgery and IPHP, with a median response of 6 months. RIGS technology aided in the selection of IPHP as a treatment choice by demonstrating the presence of an occult tumor burden in those patients whose traditional explorations were deceiving. This chapter includes technical details and suggestions for improving and modifying the use of IPHP."
CD011134,0,8843115,1,99Tcm-IMMU4 imaging in recurrent colorectal cancer: efficacy and impact on surgical management.,"The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of scintigraphy with the 99Tcm-labelled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monoclonal antibody Fab' fragment (IMMU4) in the diagnosis of recurrent colorectal carcinoma and to investigate its usefulness in the intraoperative surgical management of patients undergoing re-operation because of a rising serum CEA. We evaluated 24 patients prospectively who had rising serum CEA 6-19 months after initial surgery for colorectal carcinoma. Ten patients had lesions confirmed by computed tomography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic examination or barium enema. Fourteen patients had negative findings on one or more of the above studies, but were suspected of having occult disease from their rising serum CEA. All patients were scheduled for surgery for restaging during a ""second look' procedure. Planar and single photon emission tomography (SPET) imaging was performed in all patients. All scintigraphic findings were correlated with surgical and histopathological results. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 81, 90 and 86% respectively when analysed by lesion, and 95, 60 and 88% respectively when analysed by patient. Ten of 14 (71%) patients with occult disease were correctly diagnosed as having recurrent disease. The SPET images were shown to have superior detectability (80%) compared with the planar images (35%). The surgeon judged the study to have had a neutral impact in 75% of the patients, but to have been helpful in 25%. We conclude that this antibody is potentially useful in detecting recurrent colorectal carcinoma in patients with rising serum CEA, especially when conventional imaging is negative or equivocal. It can also be helpful in altering planned surgery."
CD011134,0,8837299,0,Local and regional recurrence of carcinoma of the colon and rectum: II. Factors relating to operative technique.,"Despite many recent advances in the field of radiation therapy, chemotherapy and even immunotherapy, surgical resection remains the mainstay of curative treatment for carcinoma of the colon and rectum. Locoregional recurrence is a recognized type of failure, and it is the most direct measurement of the relevance of surgery to cancer control. Factors that influence relapse rates and sites deserve in-depth and periodical review. Local or locoregional (LR) recurrence implies the reappearance of carcinoma after an intended complete removal of the tumour. It is usually defined as tumour regrowth at the anastomosis or immediately within or contiguous to the operative area. For rectal cancer, the adjacent organs include the perineum, bladder and vagina; and LR failure includes perineal or pelvic lesions. Many reports studied only patients with colon or rectal cancers, while others presented their data of the colon and rectum together. In this review, I shall use colon, rectum and colorectum to designate the composition of each patient population. Published results from all available English sources were reviewed, concentrating on reports of the last 10 years. Data analysed by statistical methods are emphasized, and a probability of occurrence of one in 20 or less (P < 0.05) is considered significant. Various clinicopathological factors of the tumour and host, and adjuvant radiotherapy that affected the LR recurrence rates have been presented in another paper (part 1, 283 - 293). Technical details and issues relating to performance of the operation will be discussed in this paper (part II). Quantitative information presented here predate the wide use of laparoscopic or minimal invasive surgery in treating the primary tumour, and the polar practice of periodic colonoscopy, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or computed tomography as regular follow-up tests. Thus, these baseline data will be useful to study the changes in rates and sites of recurrence in the future."
CD011134,0,8831736,0,[Diagnosis and therapy for metastatic liver cancer].,"Hepatic metastases occur frequently in patients with colorectal cancer. Patients with advanced cancer should be followed carefully after curative resection of the primary lesions for the early detection of the recurrence. If hepatic metastasis is suspected on the basis of rising CEA levels, more sophisticated imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and hepatic angiography should be employed for the diagnosis. However, these tests are not cost-effective and not warranted on a routine follow-up basis. To be more cost-effective, a relatively simple and sensitive test or group of tests should be used. The authors have proposed that the basement membrane producibility of the primary lesion yields the most important information predicting a liver metastasis; the basement membrane producing cancer highly metastasizes to the liver. In contrast, more than 90% of non-producing cancer does not metastasize to the liver. The basement membrane producibility is easily examined by laminin staining. In the treatment of hepatic metastases, hepatic resection is the preferred approach when the metastases are located in a resectable segment or can be encompassed by as many as five wedge resections, but these scenarios are relatively uncommon. For unresectable disease, chemotherapy and intravenous and/or intra-arterial embolization are viable alternatives. Loco-regional treatment may offer a pharmacological advantage since a liver metastasis is almost exclusively fed by the hepatic artery. A pilot study we conducted on hepatic infusion chemotherapy combined with interleukin-2 (IL-2.MF) revealed very encouraging results (response rate: 76%), and further study in a prospective randomized trial confirmed this high response rate. Adjuvant IL-2.MF infusion therapy after curative resection of liver metastases is also effective for the prevention of recurrence in the residual liver. Based on the data, we conclude that multimodal treatments of hepatic resection and loco-regional infusion of immuno-chemotherapy (IL-2.MF) make it possible to control both resectable and unresectable liver metastases."

Five-year survival and main prognostic factors.,"Between 1986 and 1994, 19 patients underwent pulmonary resection for metastatic colorectal carcinoma. The mean interval between colon resection and appearance of pulmonary metastasis was 41 +/- 21 months. All the patients had no more than two metastases.

Mean follow-up was 35 +/- 26 months. The 5-year survival rate was 38.7%. Repeat thoracotomy for recurrent metastases was performed in one patient. The disease-free interval, the size of metastases, the type of pulmonary resection, and the location and the stage of primary cancer had no apparent influence on survival, but the survival rate at 4 years was 25% for patients with high carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level versus 80% for those with low CEA level. We conclude that, at least when the number of metastases is less than two, resection of colorectal lung metastasis is safe and effective."

CD011134,0,8717176,0,[Tumor cell dissemination in bone marrow and peritoneal cavity. An immunocytochemical study of patients with stomach or colorectal carcinoma].,"The tumor spread and the radicality of surgical resection are the most important facts in a patient's prognosis. In spite of curative tumor resection many patients die from metastases or local tumor recurrence. One possible reason is early dissemination of tumor cells which cannot be detected with clinical methods of examination. For this reason the aim of our study was to examine both bone marrow and peritoneal lavage for disseminated tumor cells with an immunocytochemical technique in patients with a gastrointestinal carcinoma. We also wanted to find out whether there was any correlation between the incidence of tumor cell detection and the TNM classification, staging and tumor grading and whether disseminated tumor cells have any prognostic significance. Our study included 54 patients who underwent surgery in our clinic for a carcinoma of the stomach (20 patients) or the colorectum (34 patients) from November 1993 to December 1994. At the beginning of the operation bone marrow had been taken from the iliac spine, and the abdomen was irrigated with 1000 ml saline solution immediately after laparotomy or laparoscopy. After cell separation with Ficoll density centrifugation 5 x 10(5) cells were applied per slide by a cytospin technique. For detection of the tumor cells we used the APAAP technique and the following monoclonal antibodies: KL1, CK2, anti-CEA, 17-1A (bone marrow) and Ber-EP4, B72.3, anti-CEA and 17-1A (peritoneal lavage). Altogether 77% of all patients had tumor cells in the bone marrow and 69% in peritoneal lavage fluid. It was possible to detect tumor cells in bone marrow (67%) and peritoneal lavage fluid (25%) even of patients with T1 tumors. The percentage increased with depth of wall infiltration. There was a marked difference in bone marrow aspirates between patients with lymph-node-negative tumors (N0) and those with lymph-node-positive tumors (N+): 65% had tumor cells in N0 and 85% in N+ stages. This trend was also seen in patients with (M1) and without (M0) metastases, in both bone marrow aspirates and peritoneal lavage fluid. In bone marrow there was a good correlation of tumor cells with staging, but in peritoneal lavage fluid this was not so. Finally, we detected tumor cells more often in bone marrow and peritoneal lavage fluid of patients with poorly differentiated tumors (G3) or diffuse Lauren type than in patients with moderately differentiated tumors (G2) or intestinal Lauren type. After a median follow-up period of 12.5 months patients with disseminated tumor cells had a lower survival rate than patients without tumor cells."
CD011134,0,8712616,1,[Follow up in carcinoma of the large intestine].,"A valid program of follow-up has always been a crucial point in the overall therapy of the colon-cancer. In this retrospective study, the authors have used as specimen 74 patients put under observation between the years 1987 and 1992. The patient have been followed throughout the diagnostic period with various methods. It has been the will of the authors, who have presented their protocol of reference, to put under comparison the various controlling methods in order to visualize their reliability, specificity and the indication of each one of them. The CEA is the most sensible haemanalysis for lifting the doubt of recidivation. As for the TAC and ultrasound it has been reserved the job of formulating a correct diagnosis; the results of both diagnostics through imagery have been more or less the same. However, the ultrasound examination have shown more false positives than the TAC. The research of the blood occult in the stool is a rapid and economic detection in the case of intramural recidivations, even if we cannot disregard the share of false positives. A high specificity for the study of intramural recidivations has been offered by the endoscopic scan particularly when associated by a brushing and biopsy."

CD011134,0,8694534,0,TAG-72 expression and its role in the biological evaluation of human colorectal cancer.,"Immunohistochemical studies showed that TAG-72 is expressed in more than 80% of colorectal carcinomas, but is rarely expressed in normal epithelium and benign diseases. TAG-72 can also be found in the body fluids of patients with adenocarcinomas, and its direct measurement can be used in conjunction with immunocytochemical analysis to help in discriminating benign from malignant effusions. The evaluation of TAG-72 in serum of colorectal carcinoma patients showed a sensitivity of approximately 40%, comparable to that of the widely used CEA. TAG-72 serum levels correlate with the stage of disease, suggesting its utility in discriminating between early-stage versus late-stage colon carcinoma. Longitudinal studies demonstrated that TAG-72 serum levels may be used as a predictive marker of recurrences. Moreover, the simultaneous measurement of TAG-72 and CEA serum markers improves the monitoring of recurrent disease. Therefore, these data suggest that TAG-72 is a well suitable marker for colorectal cancer."

A homogeneous series of 50 patients submitted to surgery for primary rectosigmoid carcinoma was studied with both CT and MRI and followed-up for up to 2 years: local recurrences were observed in 15 patients (30%) which occurred within the first year of surgery in 67% of cases and were in extraluminal site in 86% of cases. CT appeared to be a reliable and highly sensitive screening method, with 82% sensitivity: only 2 false negatives were observed, which were nevertheless followed-up because CT had yielded questionable, and not negative, findings. In contrast, CT had only 78% specificity, being unable to differentiate fibrosis, displaced normal structures and recurrences in 7 cases; its positive predictive value (PPV) was 66%, with 89% negative predictive value (NPV) and 80% accuracy. MRI had a complementary role to CT, because of its capabilities in discriminating all the questionable CT cases and in identifying all CT false positives, thanks to its higher specificity (100%). MRI had 74% sensitivity, which was lower than that of CT; MRI yielded 2 false negatives which, however, had been previously diagnosed with CT. MRI had 100% PPV, 89% NPV and 92% accuracy. Therefore, for the early detection of rectal cancer recurrences, the following diagnostic protocol is suggested: CT should be performed first, as a screening method, within 2-4 months of surgery, and repeated every 6-8 months during the first 2 years-together with CEA values monitoring. MRI should be reserved to the patients in whom CT findings were positive, questionable, or in disagreement with clinical symptoms and/or with increasing CEA values. If MRI fails to solve the diagnostic doubt, a CT-guided biopsy of the mass should be performed."
CD011134,0,8691835,1,"Serum tumor markers in colorectal cancer staging, grading, and follow-up.","Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, a frequent neoplasia in industrialized countries, permits curative surgery. In this study we assessed the clinical role of serum tumor markers determination in diagnosing, staging, and grading colorectal cancer; the role of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 19-9, tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA) and CA 72-4 in colorectal cancer follow-up was also assessed. In 114 patients with colorectal cancer, the oncofetal antigen CEA was compared with the membrane-associated glycoproteins CA 19-9, CA 242, and CA 72-4 and with the cytokeratins TPA, tissue polypeptide-specific antigen (TPS) and tissue polypeptide monoclonal antigen (TPM). Overall, the most sensitive indices were TPA and TPS (67% and 70%, respectively). Tumor stage influenced the levels of CEA, CA 19-9, and TPA, but not those of TPS, while tumor grade influenced CEA and TPS, but not CA 72-4, TPA, and TPM. TPA was the most sensitive index in identifying early or well-differentiated colorectal cancers. The sensitivity was enhanced when this marker was determined in combination with CEA, in diagnosing both advanced and early colorectal tumors. Seventy-seven patients were followed up after therapy for at least 18 months. CEA was the most sensitive index of recurrence (58%); however, this sensitivity is too low to consider tumor markers useful in colorectal cancer follow-up."
CD011134,0,8687164,1,Serum CA 242 and CEA detect different patients with recurrent colorectal cancer.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical value of CA 242 and CEA in the follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer. Serial serum samples were available for analysis in 67 patients with subsequent recurrence, of which 36 patients had been treated for colonic and 31 patients for rectal cancer. Liver metastases were found in 32 patients, local recurrences in 18 patients, lung metastases in 11 patients and other distant metastases in 6 patients. The same serum samples were used in quantitating the serum levels of both CA 242 and CEA. At the time of clinical recurrence an elevated CA 242 level was found in 41 patients and an elevated CEA level in 49 patients. Thirty-six patients (54%) showed an elevation of both CA 242 and CEA, five patients (7%) had increased CA 242 alone and 13 patients (19%) increased CEA alone. Altogether, 54 patients (81%) showed an elevation of either or both markers at the time of clinical recurrence. Initially CA 242 alone began to rise in 14 patients (21%) and CEA alone in 16 patients (24%). The lead time was calculated from 28 patients that had four or more serum samples available during follow-up. CA 242 increased in median 5,7 months and CEA in median 3,4 months before clinical recurrence (p=0.34). CA 242 was more sensitive for lung metastases (64%) than CEA (45%), whereas CEA was superior to CA 242 in liver metastases (88% versus 72%, respectively) and in local recurrences (56% versus 39%, respectively). Both CA 242 and CEA seem to be useful in early diagnosis of a recurrence in the follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,8662095,0,Value of radioimmunoscintigraphy with technetium-99m labelled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (BW431/26) in the detection of colorectal cancer.,"This study was undertaken as part of a Coordinated Research Programme initiated by the International Atomic Energy Agency to evaluate the usefulness of radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) in the management of patients with colorectal cancer. Technetium-99m labelled BW431/26, a monoclonal antibody against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), was used. The study included 73 patients (31 females and 42 males). Sixty-eight patients were suspected of having recurrent colorectal adenocarcinoma while another five were suspected to have primary colorectal cancer. Images were acquired at 10 min and 4 and 24 h following the injection of radioantibody. The efficacy of RIS in tumour detection was evaluated by the findings at surgery, histological investigation and/or other diagnostic modalities and clinical follow-up. Four of five patients with suspected primary colorectal cancer gave true-positive results (three at primary sites, one at the site of a metastatic lesion) while one was false-positive. The overall accuracy of RIS in the diagnosis of recurrent colorectal cancer was 87%. Its sensitivity in the detection of locoregional or abdominal recurrence and liver metastases was 97% and 89% respectively. RIS was more accurate than computed tomography (CT) scan in the detection of pelvic recurrence and liver metastases while CT scan was far superior to RIS in detecting lung metastases. RIS proved most useful in patents who had rising CEA levels on clinical follow-up but in whom other work-up, including CT scan, was negative. The advantages of RIS include the ability to detect tumour recurrence prior to other investigations and to identify tumour recurrence in areas such as the pelvis, where CT and magnetic resonance imaging have their greatest weaknesses in diagnosing recurrent disease. The imaging accuracy is significantly increased when combined CT and antibody imaging is performed."

CD011134,0,8623053,0,Role of positron emission tomography scanning in evaluating gastrointestinal neoplasms.,"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is rapidly evolving into a useful imaging modality for early and accurate detection of malignant tumor sites. Several recent studies have documented improved efficacy of detecting recurrent colorectal and hepatic (primary and metastatic) tumor sites with a sensitivity ranging from 92% to 100% and an accuracy of 90% to 96%. PET-FDG imaging using 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose has been found to be superior to computed tomography (CT) in detecting recurrent colorectal, hepatic, and abdominopelvic recurrent tumor sites from different primary cancers. PET-FDG imaging can be a cost-effective tool in the screening of patients with an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen and/or equivocal CT findings and suspected colorectal cancer. The role of PET scanning using FDG or C-11-5-HTP or C-11-L-DOPA appears promising in pancreatic carcinoma and functional endocrine tumors. Further studies are being carried out to assess the role of PET scanning in other gastrointestinal cancers."

CD011134,0,8850029,0,Comparison by carcinoembryonic antigen doubling time of hepatic injection and infusion for unresectable hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer.,"This study explored the efficacy of hepatic arterial therapy, comparing both injection and infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in prolonging the survival of 92 patients with recurrent unresectable hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer. With respect to pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen doubling time (CEA-DT), 56 patients were treated with intra-arterial injection, and 36 with intra-arterial infusion. In 21 patients with a CEA-DT of less than 40 days, the cumulative survival of patients treated with arterial injection was significantly longer than that of patients treated with arterial infusion. In 45 patients with a CEA-DT of 40-80 days, the survival curves of patients did not differ from each other. Of the remaining 26 patients with a CEA-DT of more than 80 days, those treated using arterial infusion had an excellent prognosis, in contrast to those treated using arterial injection, with statistical significance. CEA-DT may be useful when choosing a chemotherapy regimen, and may help to accurately establish the prognosis of patients with unresectable hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,8748205,0,How to integrate serum tumor markers into clinical oncologic practice.,"Several serum tumor markers have been studied in different types of epithelial cell-associated cancer. The application of these markers in clinical oncologic practice is hampered by insufficient sensitivity and specificity in most primary tumors. It is important to define which markers contribute to patient management. Prostate-specific antigen can be used in prostate cancer patients for screening and monitoring advanced disease. Cancer antigen 125 is primarily used for the monitoring of combined chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients. In breast cancer patients preoperative levels of cancer antigen 15-3, carcinoembryonic antigen, and tissue polypeptide antigen specific do not contribute in prognosis, but changes in the levels of these markers predict the clinical outcome in the treatment of advanced disease better than UICC criteria. Carcinoembryonic antigen and tissue polypeptide antigen specific can detect recurrence in colorectal cancer patients earlier than imaging methods. Tissue polypeptide antigen specific is sensitive in measuring response to combined chemotherapy in advanced gastrointestinal cancer. In bladder cancer, urine levels of cytokeratins are sensitive in indicating advanced disease. In small-cell lung cancer neuron-specific enolase is a good indicator of chemotherapy response. In non-small-cell lung cancers, cytokeratins may also predict response in chemotherapy treatment. Clinical application of tumor markers in the correct circumstances can omit more invasive and costly procedures and will contribute to better patient care."

Results of the European multicenter trial.,"In seven European countries a multicenter trial with the 99mTc-labelled monoclonal anti-CEA antibody BW 431/26 was conducted in 730 patients. The antibody is used for the immunoscintigraphic visualisation of CEA-expressing tumours. Investigated were in particular colorectal tumours, bladder and breast carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of the lung and gastric carcinoma. The main area of use is the detection of recurrences and screening for foci in patients with rising serum CEA. The sensitivity amounts to at least 80% in case of primary colorectal tumours (n = 129) and their abdominal or pelvic metastases (n = 33) and to 90% for their recurrences (n = 107). HAMAs were detectable in less than 15% of patients investigated for the first time.

CD011134,0,8560891,0,[A new concept in imaging pelvic recurrence of curatively operated rectal carcinoma--image fusion of nuclear magnetic resonance tomography and anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy (SPECT): technique and clinical example].,"We present a new technique of image fusion (IF) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRT) and anti-CEA-immunoscintigraphy (Behring 431/26) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We performed SPECT and MRT within 8 hours on the same day. Glucagon intravenously was used to reduce artefacts due to intestinal motility. Before image fusion we analysed the SPECT and MRT images independently of each other. The MRT and SPECT were connected by a local area network (LAN) to a Gateway computer, which is also used as a picture archive. There a program automatically starts, translates the MRT data from the ACR/NEMA format to the Elscint one and these data are sent for image fusion to the nuclear medicine computer Elscint SP1. By means of a clinical example we present anatomic concordant superimposition and explain the findings and the clinical value of our technique. This system and technique are equally applicable to other digital imaging investigations. By IF, on the basis of the certain evidence of the tracer depot of a pathological lesion diagnosed by MRT and the reliability of the anatomical assignment of a focal lesion diagnosed by SPECT, early detection of local recurrence after surgical treatment of rectal cancer, the correct localisation of recurrent disease and its distinction from non-malignant tissue becomes possible.

Because the patient was considered to be a high operative risk due to his poor general condition, S1 was administered at 100 mg/day for 5 days/week over 12 weeks. However, as the serum carcinoembryonic antigen level continued to gradually increase, partial resection of the transverse colon was finally performed.

CD011134,0,7874576,0,CA 72-4 serum marker--a new tool in the management of carcinoma patients.,"Among the new tumor markers that have been recently proposed, CA 72-4 is of particular interest, not only for its capabilities in diagnosing and monitoring certain neoplastic diseases, but also for its excellent specificity. Several studies focused on the potential clinical usefulness of CA 72-4 in gastrointestinal (GI) and gynecological cancer, showing a sensitivity of approximately 40% in colorectal and gastric cancer and 50% in ovarian cancer, with an overall specificity of more than 95%. Longitudinal evaluations of patients with either GI or gynecological malignant diseases demonstrated that significant elevations of CA 72-4 serum levels may be predictive of recurrent disease. Moreover, the combination of CA 72-4 with other known serum markers, such as CEA and CA 19-9 for GI cancer or CA 125 for ovarian cancer, indicated that an increase in the sensitivity can be achieved without substantial changes in the overall specificity, improving the possibility of monitoring these patients. In conclusion, these results provide a strong argument for the use of CA 72-4 in the management of these neoplastic diseases."

CD011134,0,7793826,0,[Place of surgery in the treatment of lung metastases from colorectal cancers].,"The authors analysed the five main series reported in the literature exclusively devoted to surgical treatment of lung metastases of colon and rectum cancers and their own experience. The classical indications, limited to solitary lesions, have been extensively modified, and resection of bilateral lesions, recurrent lesions and pulmonary lesions in patients previously operated for other extrathoracic metastases is now possible. The 5-year survival rates vary between 20 and 44% in the various series. The complete nature of the resection is an essential prerequisite to prolonged survival. The other prognostic factors are discussed: presence of lymph node invasion or raised CEA appear to carry a poor prognosis. On the other hand, the type of resection performed, the disease-free interval, the repeated nature of the pulmonary resection and the presence of previously operated extrathoracic metastases do not appear to influence survival. Opinions differ concerning the prognostic significance of disseminated pulmonary lesions, particularly when complete resection is possible. These results confirm the special place of surgery in the treatment of lung metastases of colon and rectum cancers. The operative indications are still difficult to define, but the relatively benign nature of this surgery justifies an extension of the indications."

CD011134,0,7750106,1,"Usefulness of CEA, TPA, GICA, CA 72.4, and CA 195 in the Diagnosis of primary colorectal cancer and at its relapse.","A protocol with tumor markers as guidelines to follow up colorectal cancer patients was designed using criteria other than those commonly reported. They included combination of several markers and their dynamic evaluation of three different levels of increase: isolated elevated value (IEV), constant level of elevation (CE), and progressive increase (PI). In a total of 90 patients, the levels of combined serum CEA-TPA and GICA were serially measured, and in 71 of them, CA 72.4 and CA 195 levels were also determined. The tumor markers were measured during the first few months after surgery, and the usefulness of combined CEA-TPA-GICA and other, possibly more favorable combinations was determined in relation to ""early"" detection of recurrence and development of metastases. In addition the usefulness of conventional radiologic examinations and the impact on patients survival following ""early"" diagnosis was evaluated. A positive correlation was found between elevated preoperative serum tumor marker levels and the stage of disease. The postoperative variation of high serum CEA values was useful in identifying micrometastases after primary tumor resection. In the ""early"" diagnosed 14 patients with recurrence during the postoperative follow-up period, the highest sensitivity was found for TPA (87%) and, of the marker combinations, TPA-GICA (93%) with a lead time of 4.6 +/- 5.6 and 5.4 +/- 7.8 months (mean +/- SD) respectively. In nonrelapsed patients, falsely positive results of TPA-GICA (25%) were fewer than those for TPA-CA 195 (31%) and TPA-GICA-CA72-4 (35%). However, TPA-CA 195 and TPA-GICA-CA72-4, based upon their high sensitivity in patients with metastases, seemed in keeping with the effectiveness of TPA-GICA for monitoring of postoperative patients with colorectal cancer. In patients who developed recurrences, PI was more frequently present than IEV. In patients without recurrence, the opposite occurred. CE had less frequently discriminatory capability between these two groups than IEV and PI. Routine radiographic studies were ineffective whereas liver echography with its high sensitivity revealed the first sign of recurrence. Eight (50%) of the 16 relapses (two patients relapsed twice) were suitable for surgery because only one organ with a single metastasis was involved. Three (75%) of the 4 patients with ""early"" diagnosis of recurrence are alive without evidence of disease 5, 18, and 20 months after the last surgery. The results of this study revealed the importance of ""early"" diagnosis of recurrence for improved survival of patients with colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,7733553,0,Hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastases.,"The lack of other effective treatment for colorectal liver metastases makes hepatic resection a primary treatment consideration. Between January 1980 and December 1990, 26 selected patients with liver colorectal metastases who underwent hepatic resection were reviewed. The age, sex, site of primary lesion, histological grade, lymph node involvement, location, size, and number of hepatic metastases, type of hepatic resection, and preoperative CEA blood levels were documented. Complete removal with histologically negative resection margins were accomplished in 24 patients. The extent of resection performed was hepatic lobectomy in 12 patients. Segmentectomy in eight patients, and wedge resection in four patients. The 5-year survival rate was 30.5 per cent. Patients with metachronous metastases showed a better survival rate than those with synchronous lesions--46.6% versus 13.6% respectively (P = 0.08). None of the other factors studied showed a significant effect on survival. All patients were followed from the time of hepatic resection to the time of this study or death. During a median follow-up of 30.9 months, 20 patients developed recurrence of their disease (60 per cent in the liver). There was no perioperative mortality. Morbidity arose in 66.6 per cent of patients, with a majority of the complications being minor. We conclude that hepatic resection can be performed safely enough to be recommended in selected patients."

Immunocytological methods enable the detection of disseminated cancer cells before their clinical manifestation as demonstrated by this study. Lavage samples from the peritoneal cavity and bone marrow samples from 147 patients with an adenocarcinoma of the stomach, colon and pancreas were investigated with a panel of six different monoclonal antibodies against tumor-associated antigens (CEA, CA-19-9, 19-1A, C-54-0, Ra96) and cytokeratin, respectively. Additionally, 43 patients with benign diseases were investigated as a control group. Micrometastatic cells were detected either in the bone marrow or the peritoneal cavity in 51% of the cancer patients (gastric cancer: 51%, colorectal cancer: 40%, pancreatic cancer: 72%). The occurrence of stained cells in the peritoneal cavity and bone marrow samples correlated with the tumor stage and showed even in about 30% of patients with a stage I tumor positive bone marrow and/or peritoneal cavity samples. No unspecific reactions were found in the control group. The 2-year follow up shows a significant correlation between tumor cell detection and the survival.

CD011134,0,7657490,0,Recurrent pattern of digestive tract carcinoma in the Japanese: comparison of gastric cancer to colon cancer.,"Six hundred and two consecutive cases of gastric cancer and 204 of colorectal cancer in recent decades were investigated for recurrence. Recurrence occurred in 103 cases of gastric cancer and 31 cases of colorectal cancer. We classified three categories of recurrent patterns; A: local, B: peritoneal dissemination, and C: distant metastasis. In gastric cancer, 11 cases (11%) were grouped A, 50 (48%) were B, and 42 (41%) were C. Similarly, 12 (39%) were grouped A, 5 (16%) were B, and 14 (45%) were C in colorectal cancer. The incidence of local recurrence was more increased in colorectal cancer than in gastric cancer (p < 0.01). On the contrary, that of peritoneal dissemination was more increased in gastric cancer than in colorectal cancer (p < 0.01). In gastric cancer, 8 cases of 103 survived more than 5 years after operation, furthermore 7 cases obtained more than 5 years of tumor-free interval. At the time of diagnosis of recurrence, data of serum CEA was available in 77 for gastric cancer and 29 for colon cancer. CEA positive cases were revealed 32 (42%) for gastric cancer and 24 (83%) for colorectal cancer (p < 0.01). Our data clarified the different recurrence patterns between gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. And suggest that more than 5 years follow-up should be needed in patients with gastric cancer."
CD011134,0,7645930,0,Radioimmunoassisted follow-up and surgery vs traditional examinations and surgery after radical excision of colorectal cancer.,"The authors report their experience in the radioimmunodetection of recurrent colorectal cancer in comparison with traditional examinations. 485 patients were studied after radical surgery for colorectal cancer: 168 (Group 1) were studied with a radioimmunoassisted follow-up plan including: Immunoscintigraphy (IS), serum markers assays, Radioimmunoguided Endoscopy (RIGE), Intraoperative Radioimmuno-localization (IORIL) in case of reoperation; 317 (Group 2) underwent a protocol with traditional examinations. In 24 patients of Group 1 IS was performed even at the time of their admission for primary cancer. 7 patients underwent RIGE for primary cancer and 16 in the follow-up. IORIL was performed in 12 patients with primary cancer and in 16 in the course of reoperation. The radioimmunodiagnostic methods were performed after a single administration of the radiolabeled MAb (111In F(ab')2 a-CEA and 111In B72.3). The radioimmunoassisted follow-up plan detected a greater number of recurrences than traditional examinations (27% vs 13%). The rates of radical reoperation in Group 1 and 2 were 61% and 37% respectively. 33% of the patients of Group 2 were alive 24 months after radical reoperation vs 62.5% of the patients of Group 1. Immunoscintigraphy demonstrated a good sensitivity and specificity, mainly in the detection of pelvic recurrences (sens. 92%, spec. 84%). The radioimmunoassisted follow-up plan was well accepted by the patients. RIGE led to the detection of 3 periluminal recurrences of rectal cancer that traditional investigations failed to demonstrate and in 5 cases influenced the patients management. IORIL detected minimal tumor foci (2 mm.) where pre and intraoperative study were negative, while the histopathologic examination gave evidence of tumor. Considering that the costs of the radioimmunodiagnostic methods and of traditional examinations are very similar, we can conclude that the radioimmunoassisted follow-up plan has a favorable cost/benefit rate and a remarkable impact on the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer."

Computed tomography (CT) showed a low-density lesion in the left hepatic lobe, and the initial CT-guided biopsy of the liver mass was reported to demonstrate a benign lesion. Ultrasonography (US) showed a hypoechoic lesion, and technetium-99m red blood cell (RBC) scan failed to suggest a hemangioma. However, radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) using 99mTc- labeled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monoclonal antibody clearly demonstrated increase uptake of antibody in the liver lesion. Scheduled hepatic angiography was canceled and subsequent exploratory laparotomy confirmed liver metastasis. RIS appears most helpful in the diagnosis of hepatic metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer and a rising CEA level.

CD011134,0,7577022,0,The use of prognostic markers in surgery for colorectal cancer.,"The basis for prognostic prediction after surgery for colorectal cancer remains the various pathological staging systems based on that of Dukes. Serum prognostic markers have not shown significant independent prognostic power compared with these predictive tools. Much energy has been expended in examining the ability of serum markers to predict recurrent tumour prior to the onset of symptoms. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has been a particular subject of attention, and has been widely, though variably, advocated as a useful predictor in these circumstances. It has been estimated that around half a million Americans are presently undergoing regular postoperative CEA monitoring to this end. Controversy continues regarding the therapeutic utility of such monitoring. This may be resolved when the results of the only randomised trial in the field are published in the near future. No other serum marker, nor any combination of markers, has been shown clearly to be superior to CEA as a predictor of recurrent tumour."

Six cases in group A were H1, 4 were H2, and 2 were H3; 12 cases in group B were H1, and 3 were H2. In both groups, primary lesions were removed. All cases received high-dose intermittent 5-FU infusion (WHF) at 1,000 mg/m2 via a reservoir for 5 hours a week at the outpatient clinic. Cumulative survival rates for 1 and 3 years are 100% and 68.6%, respectively, in group A, and 58.7% and 25.2% in group B, which indicates the treatment outcome in group A was significantly better. Recurrence in residual liver was not found in group A except for one case whose tumor was unremoved, but it was found in 8 cases (53.3%) in group B up to this writing. CEA value after resection in group A was within the normal range except for one case with a local recurrence. It seems that intra-arterial 5-FU infusion chemotherapy for residual liver after resection of hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer has a preventive effect on residual liver, and the improvement of the cumulative survival rate can be expected."

CD011134,0,7571064,0,Radioimmunoguided surgery: clinical experience with different monoclonal antibodies and methods.,"The intraoperative detection of tumors by means of a gamma-ray detector that recognized radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) on tumour cell surfaces has been shown to be feasible and clinically useful. The technology is called the Radioimmunoguided Surgery (RIGS) system. We have been working with this system for five years and in this paper we report our experience using different radiolabelled MoAbs and methods in terms of clinical utility in patients with primary or recurrent colorectal cancer. In the first part of the experience we injected with the MoAb B72.3 a group of 66 patients with primary (36) or recurrent (30) cancer introducing for 7 out of 66 a variation of the method to try to overcome some limits of the original procedure. With the new method, based on the avidin-biotin binding, it is possible to use anti-Cea MoAbs and to reduce the preoperative waiting time, injecting biotinylated MoAbs and avidin. In the second part of the experience, a second group of 15 patients with primary (12) and recurrent (3) cancer was injected with biotinylated MoAbs FO23C5 (anti-Cea) while in a third group of 16 patients, 6 with primary and 10 with recurrent cancer a cocktail of antibodies was used. During surgery a probe (NEOPROBE) was used to count obvious tumor, surrounding normal tissue and to scan the abdomen for areas of increased radioactivity. In the first group of patients tumour was localized by probe in 18/36 (50%) cases of primary cancer and in 24 out of 30 recurrences (80%). In the second group tumour was localized in 8/12 (67%) primary cancers and in 2 out of 3 (67%) recurrences. In the last group primary tumours were localized in 5/6 (83%) patients and recurrent cancer in 7/10 (70%). The method altered the surgical procedure in 2 out of 36 primary tumours (6%) and in 8 out of 30 recurrences (27%) injected with the B72.3. In the group of 15 patients injected with the anti-Cea the method changed the surgical strategy in 2/12 (16%) primaries and in 1 out of 3 recurrences. We had no real clinical utility in the primary cancers injected with cocktails but in 4 out of 10 (40%) patients with recurrent cancer it was possible to localize occult metastatic tissue. In conclusion, the sensitivity of the different MoAbs is similar in the groups even though it is noted that B72.3 seems to be more indicated in recurrent cancers and the FO23C5 in primary tumors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD011134,0,7571043,0,Follow-up of colorectal cancer.,"Surveillance for a second primary colon or rectal cancer, detection and treatment of recurrent disease, and health maintenance are the essential components of follow-up of a patient population with potentially curative resection of a primary large bowel cancer. The value of follow-up programs have been extensively studied with colorectal cancer. Of 100 colorectal cancer patients in a follow-up program, approximately 20 patients should have prolongation of life as a result of surveillance, detection and treatment, and health maintenance. Detection of recurrent cancer and its treatment may be the most expensive and least effective part of the follow-up program. Lead time is minimal with intensive follow-up (including serial CEA blood tests) when compared to the time of diagnosis derived from symptoms of recurrent malignancy in an informed patient. Aggressive reoperative surgery in selected patients with recurrent disease with use of adjunctive radiation therapy and chemotherapy when appropriate, will salvage long term the greatest number of people and yield some palliative benefits. It is crucial that reoperative surgery be pursued by an experienced team familiar with this type of intervention. Comprehensive follow-up of colorectal cancer patients has a high value in its medical economic cost and should continue to be pursued, studied, to become more cost effective, and integrated into a complete management plan."

CD011134,0,7561233,0,"Comparison of CA 72-4, CA 19-9 and CEA in the diagnosis and monitoring of gastric cancer.","In order to assess the utility of the tumor-associated antigen CA 72-4 in the diagnosis and monitoring of gastric cancer, this tumor marker was measured preoperatively in 718 patients. This group comprised 282 patients with malignant disease (115 with gastric cancer and 167 with other malignancies not involving the stomach) and 476 patients with benign surgical diseases. These results were compared with those for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the tumor-associated antigen CA 19-9. CA 72-4 was above the normal limit of 2.5 U/ml in 61% of the patients with gastric cancer, in 35% of the patients with other malignancies, and in 7% of the patients with benign diseases. CEA and CA 19-9 were elevated in 37% of the patients with gastric cancer ( > 3 ng/ml for CEA and > 37 U/ml for CA 19-9). CA 72-4 levels were above 10 U/ml in 26% of the gastric cancer patients, in 15% of patients with other malignancies, and in 0.4% of the patients with benign diseases. There was a good correlation between CA 72-4 level and tumor stage in gastric cancer. CA 72-4 serum levels were over 2.5 U/ml in 31%, 48%, 68% and 88% of patients with stage I, II, III and IV disease, respectively. CA 72-4 was found to be more sensitive than CEA and CA 19-9 in detecting recurrences of gastric cancer. In the postoperative-care period, carcinoma recurred in 29 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

These levels are highly variable from patient to patient, and the mechanism that determines these levels is still poorly understood."
CD011134,0,7545144,0,Significance of tenascin serum level as tumor marker in primary colorectal carcinoma.,"Tenascin serum levels were evaluated in 118 patients with primary colorectal carcinoma and in a control group of 51 healthy persons in a double-sided sandwich ELISA. The data were correlated with post-operative TNM-staging. Patients with colorectal carcinomas had significantly higher serum levels of tenascin than the control group. At the 95% level of specificity, sensitivity was 25%. Tumor grading obviously had no influence on the level of tenascin in serum. With increasing pT-category, tenascin levels increased as well. In patients with distant metastatic disease, serum tenascin levels were significantly higher than in patients without distant metastases. These data suggest that, in colorectal carcinoma, the preoperative level of serum tenasin reflects the total tumor burden and correlates with metastatic disease. Our observation warrants a prospective study of the relevance of tenascin serum levels with regard to prognosis and as an indicator of relapse."
CD011134,0,7542493,0,A clinical study on pseudomyxoma peritonei.,"To elucidate the clinical entity of pseudomyxoma peritonei, nine patients (male: female = 6:3) who had been treated in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in the past 13 years were reviewed. The male patients with original appendiceal tumour were older than the male patients with original colon cancer or indefinite tumour (70, 67 and 67 years vs 42, 27 and 50 years). In addition, the former group survived in a disease-free status for 28 months on average, while the latter group died within 2 years. Echogenic ascites and diffuse low-attenuation intra-abdominal masses with scalloping on the surface of liver detected by ultrasonography and by computerized tomography, respectively, were found in most of the patients. Elevation of the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) during recurrence of the disease was also noted. This series suggested that: (i) the pre-operative diagnosis could be made with careful physical examination in conjunction with sonography or computerized tomography; (ii) the prognosis was better in patients with tumour of appendiceal origin; and (iii) serum CEA might be valuable for early detection of recurrence."

CD011134,0,7529527,0,Tissue polypeptide-specific antigen (TPS) in monitoring palliative treatment response of patients with gastrointestinal tumours.,"The new proliferation marker, tissue polypeptide-specific antigen (TPS), representing the specific epitope M3 of tissue polypeptide antigen, and three conventional biochemical markers, CEA, CA 19-9 and CA-195, were analysed in 69 patients with advanced gastrointestinal tumours. The aim of our study was to assess the clinical relevance of these markers and to determine whether their use in monitoring the course of the disease can reduce the need for serial imaging procedures. At baseline, pathologically elevated TPS levels occurred in 90% of patients. CEA was elevated in 73%, CA 19-9 in 59% and CA-195 in 68%. With a detection rate of > 90% in both advanced colorectal (n = 37) and pancreatic cancer (n = 20), and of 75% in gastric cancer (n = 12), TPS was the most sensitive marker in all three tumour types included in this analysis. Serial evaluations of TPS and other biochemical markers were available in 39 patients undergoing palliative systemic chemotherapy. Treatment with a fluorouracil-based regimen resulted in a partial response in 5/27 patients with colorectal cancer, whereas 2/12 patients with pancreatic cancer responded to therapy with a high-dose epirubicin combination regimen. All other patients had disease stabilisation or suffered from progressive disease. When compared with the results of serial CT scanning, the TPS correlated best with the course of the disease, the positive predictive value being 75% for a partial response, 96% for stable disease and partial response combined and 100% for progressive disease. The corresponding values for CEA were 50%, 81% and 62% and were similar to those for CA 19-9 and CA-195. In summary, TPS seems to represent a sensitive, clinically relevant and specific marker of proliferative activity in gastrointestinal cancer. According to our preliminary results in colorectal and pancreatic cancer, TPS may be considered as the primary means of monitoring treatment, and imaging reduced to confirm the response."
CD011134,0,7493347,0,Diagnostic accuracy and tumor-targeting kinetics of complete versus fragmented 99mTc-labeled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibodies: an intraindividual comparison.,"The goal of this study was to intraindividually compare a complete versus a fragmented, directly 99mTc-labeled, monoclonal anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antibody, with respect to their antigen-targeting kinetics, sensitivity, and diagnostic accuracy in patients with CEA-expressing tumors. Twenty-five patients were investigated with the 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA IgG1 BW 431/26 and the F(ab')2/Fab' fragment mixture F023C5 within 7 days. For quantitative analysis, the region of interest technique was applied to planar scans, whole-body scans, and single photon emission computed tomography slices 10 min to 48 h postinjection (PI). Final correlations were performed according to the histopathology after surgery or biopsy. Earliest tumor detection was possible with complete IgG1 4 h PI (52% of finally positive lesions). Twenty-four- or even 48-h scans were necessary in 48% of finally positive lesions; tumor detection with fragments was possible in 17% at 1 h PI and in 94% at 4 h PI. With both monoclonal antibodies, in 35%, single photon emission computed tomography was necessary for tumor detection. Absolute antibody uptake in tumor lesions was higher with complete monoclonal antibodies than with fragments. The sensitivity of fragments was higher in detecting primary tumors, local recurrences, and lymph node metastases. For detection of liver metastases, sensitivity was also higher for fragments than for IgG (87 versus 73%), but in scintigraphically positive lesions, tumor:background ratios were significantly lower with fragments (1.26 +/- 0.12 versus 1.70 +/- 0.32; P < 0.01). Therefore, fragments seem to be more suitable for earlier detection of lesions known for their good vascularization, vascular permeability, and antigen accessibility, such as local recurrences, lymph node metastases, and peritoneal carcinomatoses. In liver metastases (high interstitial pressure, low vascular leakage), sensitivity of fragments is higher, but their rapid serum and whole-body clearance lead to a lower absolute antibody uptake, with the consequence of significantly lower tumor:background ratios than with IgG."
CD011134,0,7493341,0,Improving the balance between treatment and diagnosis: a role for radioimmunodetection.,"Despite major advances in diagnostic testing, including the introduction and widespread availability of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, inadequate diagnostic information still interferes with proper management of many patients with cancers. This is particularly true for recurrent colorectal cancer, for example. In the course of this symposium, significant advances have been reported which are likely to improve management of this clinical situation. 111In, oncoscint for colorectal and ovarian cancer imaging, has been approved for single use only, and is a product licensed by the Food and Drug Administration. It has been shown to be significantly more effective than CT for detecting the presence of disease that is confined to the abdomen outside the liver. This agent is very useful in a limited role. A larger opportunity awaits other preparations reported at this conference, especially 99mTc-labeled Immu-4 carcinoembryonic antigen, which is significantly better than CT for determining resectability of recurrent cancer (T. Behr et al., Cancer Res. 55 (Suppl.): 5777S-5785S, 1995). The 99mTc-labeled compound preparations offer the advantages of low immunogenicity, excellent imaging energies of 99mTc, and ""same-day"" imaging. Even the most effective cancer treatment such as surgical resection, if applied to a patient who basically does not need it, can be a needless expense and a trauma to the patient. To date, our emphasis in oncology research has been heavily weighted toward developing new therapies. The success of radioimmunodetection is one indication of why it is time for a paradigm shift, during which we can move toward a more balanced program that emphasizes both diagnosis and therapy. To achieve this we must urge research institutions such as the National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society to make major investments in the diagnostic aspects of cancer care. With the knowledge base that we have now, we can make improvements in patient care by emphasizing development of improved diagnostic methods and support for cost-effectiveness studies for developed methods, in order that currently available treatments can be more intelligently applied."
CD011134,0,7489178,0,Prognostic factors in surgery for local recurrence of rectal cancer.,"Fifty-five patients had resection of locally recurrent rectal cancer. Fourteen patients (25 per cent) had distant metastases, which were resected concurrently in six (11 per cent). Thirty-three patients (60 per cent) had preoperative (one patient) or postoperative (32) external beam radiotherapy (45-60 Gy). The 5-year survival rate was 18 per cent with a median survival of 24 months. The median symptom-free interval was 24 months. At a median follow-up of 28 months 53 per cent of patients had a second local recurrence and 24 per cent metastases only. Treatment complications occurred in 12 patients (22 per cent), three (5 per cent) of whom died 3-10 months after operation. Variables that were significantly related with longer survival and palliation were the radical nature of the operation, the absence of severe symptoms (such as pain, obstruction or sepsis), a recurrent tumour diameter of less than 5 cm measured on the resected specimen and a normal carcinoembryonic antigen level after reoperation. A Cox regression model showed that recurrent tumour diameter was the only independent prognostic variable. Surgery for local recurrence achieved local control in 47 per cent of patients with a low morbidity and mortality rate."

CD011134,0,17977436,0,[Local recidives after rectal tumour operations].,"Patients with recidives after operations for rectal tumours have better prognosis than those with recidives of other gastro-intestinal tumours. Over the period from 1 January 1983 to 1 January 1990 165 patients were operated for rectal tumours (76 females and 89 males) in Dr. Dragisha Mishovitsh Clinical and Hospital Centre. On the basis of the size of rectal tumours, their position, penetration into the wall and intraoperative status surgical treatment was carried out: local ecxision (15), posterior proctotomy (37), anterior resection (64) and rectal amputation (49). In our practice we used the international classification of the tumours (pathohistology and clinical stages), UNIA INTERNATIONALIS CONTRA CANCRUM, internationally recognized on 1.1.1984. We quarterly controlled our operated patients during the first two years: rectoscopic, laboratory, EMG anal sfincter, EHO and CT abdomen, IVP examinations were performed. In patients with rectal adenocarcinoma we performed immunological examinations (CEA and CA 50) before operation, after operation and in the second year (first month and sixth month). All postoperative control examinations were important in the early detection of recidives and future treatment. We detected recidives in our patients during the first year (12), and only two in the second year after operation. We established four recidives after rectal amputation: one UICC stage II and 3 UICC stage III; 5 recidives after anterior resection: 4 UICC stage II and 1 UICC stage III; 3 recidives after posterior proctotomy: 2 UICC stage I and 1 UICC stage II, and 2 recidives after transanal excision: both recidives UICC stage I."
CD011134,0,8707771,0,The use of serologic tumor markers in gastrointestinal malignancies.,"The tumor markers CEA, CA 19-9, and AFP have a distinct and useful role to play in the management of gastrointestinal malignancies. These are clearly not ideal tumor markers. They lack day-to-day reproducibility and sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be useful as general screening tools. Taken as isolated values, they are lacking in precision. However, used in the appropriate context, with an understanding of their associated biology, these tumor markers help to manage patients and might reduce the economic burden of decision making. As we develop a better understanding of the process of neoplastic transformation and progression, new tumor markers will become available. Markers may, in the future, be used to predict responses to particular therapies or overall prognosis. Some will be molecular probes, such as the K-ras or FAP gene mutations, and others may relate to alterations in regulated processes, such as increased expression of a key enzyme in DNA synthesis, thymidylate synthase."
CD011134,0,8313787,0,"Biologic evaluation of tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 and carcinoembryonic antigen expression in colorectal cancer, Part I.","Tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 has been recently suggested as a new serum marker for colorectal cancer. In fact, approximately 40 percent of colorectal cancer patients have positive tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 serum levels at the time of diagnosis, while only 3 percent of patients with benign diseases are positive. A longitudinal evaluation of colorectal cancer patients suggested the utility of combining the measurement of tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 with that of carcinoembryonic antigen to monitor disease status not only at the time of diagnosis, but also at the time of recurrence. Several reports have indicated that the expression of some tumor antigens in colorectal adenomas may correlate with those parameters conventionally considered as indicative of malignant transformation. The presence of tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 in colorectal adenomas has been recently correlated with preneoplastic lesions, suggesting that tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 may be considered as an early marker of neoplastic transformation. The evaluation of tumor antigens can be considered a new tool in the management of colorectal cancer."

CD011134,0,8311497,0,[5-Fluorouracil plus low-dose leucovorin in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer].,"From September 1989 to September 1992, 17 patients (pts) with non-curative or recurrent colorectal cancer were treated with 5-fluorouracil (FU) plus leucovorin (LV) systemic therapy. The sites of evaluable metastases were liver (10), peritoneum (4), lung (3) and others (6). The LV dosage was 30 mg/body (low-dose method) and the FU dosage was 500-750 mg/body. Both drugs were administered either 5 days/every 4 weeks or one day/every 1 to 2 weeks via protracted or bolus infusion. The regimen was generally well tolerated, although 9 pts (53%) experienced toxicity which required dose reductions. Overall response rate was 29% (5 PR). No CR was observed. Improvement in tumor-related symptoms was noted temporarily in 7 out of 10 pts. Serum CEA level decreased in 13 out of 14 pts. All the response sites were liver (5), with simultaneous lung (1) or peritoneum (1) metastasis. The response duration was 3 to 10 months (mean 6.2 months). Second-line therapy after progression of diseases, such as combination with CDDP, was attempted in some of the PR pts, but no re-response was observed. We conclude that FU plus low-dose LV regimen is an effective therapy for advanced colorectal cancer, but further attempts should be made to increase response rate, prolongation of response duration and effective second-line therapy after progression."

CD011134,0,8261435,0,Comparison of equitoxic radioimmunotherapy and chemotherapy in the treatment of human colonic cancer xenografts.,"The therapeutic efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FUra; 0.6 mg/day x 5 days) + leucovorin (LV; 1.8 mg/day x 5 days) and of 131I-labeled MN-14 anticarcinoembryonic antigen IgG (275 microCi single dose) was evaluated in size-matched (0.3-0.7 cm3) s.c. LoVo, HT-29, DLD-1, HCT-15, LS174T, and MOSER, GW-39, and WidR human colonic tumors. These lines express varying amounts of carcinoembryonic antigen and exhibit varying degrees of in vitro responsiveness to 5-FUra. Unlike radioimmunotherapy (RAIT), multiple cycles of chemotherapy were feasible over a 3-week period. However, no therapeutic advantage to a second cycle of 5-FUra/LV administration was found. Therefore, it is reasonable to compare single cycles of both treatment modalities. RAIT was statistically more effective in 5 of 8 tumor lines (LoVo, LS174T, MOSER, WidR, and GW-39). In 1 other line (DLD-1), RAIT was marginally more efficacious, but tumors responded well to both therapies. The lack of a statistical difference between the 2 modalities of treatment may indicate that the efficacy of the 2 treatments is equivalent, or the relatively large variability within the treatment groups may have prevented significance given the number of animals evaluated. RAIT and 5-FUra/LV were equally efficacious in the HT-29 and the HCT-15 tumor lines. Of the 5 xenografts that responded better to RAIT, 3 lines (LS174T, GW-39, and WidR) demonstrated a greater percentage of tumors responding over a 5- to 6-week period. The other 3 lines (LoVo, MOSER, and DLD-1) exhibited a similar percent of tumors responding to both therapies, but a greater growth inhibition in those RAIT-treated tumors that responded. In vitro responsiveness to 5-FUra/LV did not directly correlate with in vivo responsiveness (r2 = -0.664), since LS174T and LoVo tumors, with rapid growth rates (0.05-0.36 cm3/day), were not highly responsive to therapy. Growth inhibition from RAIT also did not correlate with total tumor carcinoembryonic antigen content (r2 = 0.003), an observation that may be due to additional variables, such as accessibility of antigen and innate radiosensitivity of the tumor. RAIT was most effective in the fastest growing tumor lines (LS174T, GW-39, MOSER, WidR, and LoVo). These preclinical results suggest an advantage to radioantibody therapy over one of the most commonly used forms of chemotherapy to treat colorectal cancer. These studies also highlight the need to establish criteria that will enable the selection of therapeutic modalities in patients."

CD011134,0,8198976,0,Late mortality and levamisole adjuvant therapy in colorectal cancer.,"Beginning in 1975, 78 patients with resected stage B and C colorectal carcinoma were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either levamisole 2.5 mg kg-1 day-1 given for 2 days every week for 18 months or placebo therapy in the same schedule. Pretreatment characteristics (age, gender, disease site, CEA and stage) and the pattern of follow-up were similar in both groups. For the first 5 years following randomisation, relapse-free survival and overall survival were similar in the two treatment groups. Subsequently, excess late mortality was associated with levamisole group assignment. Consequently, overall survival was somewhat greater in the placebo group than in the levamisole group, 68% vs 38% (P < 0.08). For patients surviving 5 years from randomisation, subsequent survival favoured placebo over levamisole (100% vs 57%; P < 0.03). The absolute numbers of deaths were 27 in the levamisole group (19 definitely cancer related) and seven in the group placebo (five definitely cancer related). This long-term result seen with a more intensive adjuvant levamisole dose and schedule suggests: (1) other levamisole adjuvant trials in patients with colorectal cancer should be examined for long-term outcome; (2) future trials utilising the even higher levamisole dosage required for clinical immunomodulation should proceed cautiously."

Patients with benign diseases served as controls. Intraperitoneal micrometastatic cells were detected in 27% of colorectal, 43% of gastric and 58% of pancreatic cancer patients. In the bone marrow, the corresponding data were 29% for colorectal, 25% for gastric and 58% for pancreatic cancer patients. Combined evaluation of both compartments increased the detection rate significantly (colorectal cancer: 40%, gastric cancer: 52%, pancreatic cancer: 72%). No unwarranted reactions were found in the control group. Combining 3 antibodies (CA-19-9, Ra96, C-54-0) enabled good detection for peritoneal cavity samples. In the bone marrow, the use of 2 antibodies (KL-1 and CA-19-9) detected 94% of all positive samples, whereas KL-1 and CA-19-9 stained approx. 70% of all positive samples in each case. The occurrence of stained cells in the peritoneal cavity correlated with classical prognostic factors (TNM classification)."

The results were compared with results of the ultrasound, the CT-Scan and the Angio-CT. Patients suffered from a colorectal carcinoma (15), from a local tumor recurrence after bowel resection (10), from hepatic (39) and/or extrahepatic metastases (16). In 40 patients the diagnosis was confirmed by laparotomy. Regarding the detection of hepatic metastases the sensitivity and specificity of the Angio-CT were superior to the IS (0.86 and 0.63 vs. 0.78 and 0.45). Ultrasound and Angio-CT together revealed true positive results in 89.2%. The IS did not improve this rate. Regarding the detection of extrahepatic metastases the sensitivity and the specificity of the CT were slightly superior to the IS (0.59 and 0.87 vs. 0.47 and 0.28). However, the IS increased the rate of true positive results by 18.8% (US + CT 43.7%; +IS 62.5% true positive results). Due to these results the IS is not recommended as the method of choice to detect liver metastases. But in patients unfit for diagnostic laparotomy the IS may give additional information of the extrahepatic tumor stage."

Patients included 12 with increasing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) without anatomical evidence of recurrence, 13 with radiological abnormalities consistent with apparently isolated metastases, and 7 with recurrence and anatomical abnormalities of unclear significance. 111In-satumomab pendetide imaging detected extrahepatic abdominal and pelvic disease in 16 subjects. Imaging was most informative in patients with recurrent disease and anatomical abnormalities of unclear significance, but imaging of the liver was suboptimal owing to high levels of nonspecific uptake. We conclude 111In-satumomab pendetide imaging can supply clinically relevant information relating to the extent and location of recurrent colorectal adenocarcinoma in patients with extrahepatic abdominal and pelvic radiological abnormalities of unclear significance and in radiologically normal patients with high CEA levels."

A cohort of 149 patients who had undergone 'curative' surgery was followed up according to an intensive protocol in order to detect recurrent disease. Over a median tumour marker follow-up period of 24 months there were 25 recurrences in 24 patients. Both CEA and CA-242 alone detected half the local recurrences. The sensitivity of CEA was 84% for distant or mixed recurrence compared with 64% for CA-242. An abnormality of either CEA or CA-242 enabled detection of five out of six local recurrences and 17 out of 19 distant or mixed recurrences with a median lead time of 5 months for each marker. Both markers were elevated concurrently in only one local and 11 distant recurrences. While CA-242 alone is not superior to CEA, their combined use (either abnormal) has a high sensitivity (88%), specificity (78%) and negative predictive value (97%); this may be useful in reducing unnecessary investigations in follow-up programmes and as a guide to the initiation of further treatment for recurrent disease."

We present herein the cases of three patients with multiple liver metastases from colorectal cancer in whom complete remission was achieved by treatment with an HAI of IL-2 in combination with mitomycin C (MMC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). These patients received an HAI of IL-2 at 8 x 10(5) JRU, 5-FU at 250 mg daily, and MMC at 4 mg once weekly for 3 weeks, being the induction regimen, after which they were discharged on maintenance therapy consisting of IL-2 at 2 x 10(6) JRU, 5-FU at 250 mg twice weekly, and MMC at 4 mg once weekly. It was evident from the liver CT scan taken after 2-3 months that the metastatic foci seen before therapy had clearly disappeared, while the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) had decreased to normal levels in all three patients. Pancytopenia was seen in one patient, but other laboratory studies of the hepatic and renal parameters were normal. The total lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood showed a mild decrease, while the lymphocyte phenotype study showed a notable increase in CD4+ cells and a decrease in CD8+ cells, with an elevation of a 4/8 ratio, in all cases during therapy. One patient relapsed with pelvic recurrence 14 months after the initiation of therapy, but the other two patients are still in remission 25 and 22 months after the initiation of therapy."

While colonoscopy is an accurate modality used in screening and surveillance for patients with these two diseases, patients continue to present with colon cancer with these known premalignant diseases. This study was conducted to ascertain why patients with known premalignant disease still develop life-threatening colon cancer and to assess the clinical profile and prognosis of patients with known ulcerative colitis (UC) and familial polyposis coli (FPC) who subsequently develop colon cancer. Total colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and ileoanal pullthrough was performed on 367 patients with UC and FPC between January 1982 and March 1993 at our institution. Of these, 15 had invasive adenocarcinoma of the colon (4.1%) in addition to the primary disease. These 15 patients were studied in detail. The average duration of disease from diagnosis to definitive treatment of cancer was 17 years. Thirteen of the patients in this series had UC (87%), while only 2 had FPC (13%). Colonoscopy was used to make the diagnosis in 11 patients (73%), while the diagnosis was made only at the time of surgery in 3 (20%). Nine of the patients presented with a Dukes' B2 cancer or worse, representing 60% of the series. A high percentage had synchronous invasive cancers in this series--6 patients (40%).

The retrospective group was used for validation of the results from the prospective group. In univariate survival analyses, 19 of totally 38 variables significantly correlated to the survival. Of 13 significant blood parameters, lactate dehydrogenase (LD), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), alpha 1-, alpha 2-globulin, fibrinogen, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin, granulocytosis and thrombocytosis were the most important ones (p < or = 0.01). In the multivariate analyses (Cox regression) of the prospective group, LD, alpha 1-globulin, diagnosed liver metastases and CEA were found to be significant predictors of survival. A prognostic index was derived from the prospective group including ESR, LD and relapse-free interval.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether spectral parameters obtained noninvasively by in vivo 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can be used to assess individual response to 5-FU chemotherapy. Eighteen patients with metastases of colorectal carcinoma treated with 5-FU were examined by 19F NMR at 1.5 T. The NMR signal intensity versus time curves were observed for the cytostatic and its catabolite alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL). Clinical response to treatment was monitored by CT/MR imaging of the liver and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in the serum. 5-FU levels observed in IV-treated patients correlate with volumes of metastases in the liver region examined with the 19F NMR coil (k = 0.77, p < .0001). 5-FU levels in patients at their initial 5-FU chemotherapy were related with clinical response determined after three cycles of treatment. In the group of patients with extensive liver involvement and IV treatment, responders (n = 3) had enhanced 5-FU levels compared to nonresponders (n = 3). FBAL data indicate an apparent saturation of 5-FU catabolism in the liver for 5-FU doses > 1 g infused during 10 min. Mean absolute concentrations of FBAL were about 1 mumol per gram liver tissue. 19F NMR spectroscopy could be used to guide dose escalation schemes or to assess the modulation of 5-FU metabolism by other drugs in combined chemotherapy."

CD011134,0,7961830,0,Expression of antisense fibronectin RNA in human colon carcinoma cells disrupts the regulation of carcinoembryonic antigen by transforming growth factor beta 1.,"Transforming growth factor beta 1 regulates the expression of extracellular matrix adhesion molecules and the carcinoembryonic antigen gene family of glycoproteins in the Moser colon carcinoma cell line. Expression of fibronectin antisense RNA in the Moser cells down-regulated fibronectin mRNA expression and blocked the ability of transforming growth factor beta 1 to stimulate fibronectin secretion. Cells expressing antisense fibronectin RNA exhibited a higher rate of proliferation, changed their morphology, and produced more laminin in response to treatment with transforming growth factor beta 1. The stimulation of carcinoembryonic antigen secretion by transforming growth factor beta 1 (which normally lagged 10-16 h behind that of fibronectin secretion stimulated by transforming growth factor beta 1) was blocked by the expression of antisense fibronectin RNA. Thus, the stimulation of fibronectin secretion by transforming growth factor beta 1 was a prerequisite for subsequent stimulation of carcinoembryonic antigen secretion. In addition, the stimulation of the cellular expression of carcinoembryonic antigen and three carcinoembryonic antigen cross-reactive species of glycoproteins by transforming growth factor beta 1 was down-modulated in cells expressing antisense fibronectin RNA. We therefore conclude that fibronectin may play an important role in the mechanisms of transforming growth factor beta 1 regulation of the expression of carcino-embryonic antigen gene family of glycoproteins."

CD011134,0,7887585,0,[DNA ploidy and cell kinetics in cancer of the rectum].,"The pathological assessment of rectal cancer remained essentially unchanged for 50 years and it is based mainly on Dukes' classification and histological granding. Alternative methods of classifications have also been developed but, actually, Dukes'taging is the most important prognostic factor. The limit of Dukes' classification is the incomplete discrimination between high risk and low risk patients into the same stages. The measurements of cellular DNA content by flow cytometry is emerging as a prognostic aid in many human tumours. Authors analyze on the basis of their experience on 116 curative operations for the cancer of the rectum, the relationship between tumour's features, CEA, symptoms, recurrences, survival, type of operation and DNA flow cytometry. In 100 cases they studied the percentage of cells in ""s"" phase. (SPF). Samples of flow-cytometry were prepared using paraffin-embedded tumour blocks. The authors didn't find any statistically significant relation among pathological features, staging, ploidy and SPF. Recurrences rate was 16.6% in diploid tumours and 23% in no diploid (p = 0.3). In SPF < 25% it was 18.2% (p = 0.5). 5-year survival was worse in aneuploid patients (p = 0.06). Using Cox' multivariate regression analysis, ploidy has not independent prognostic significance. In conclusion authors consider ploidy a prognostic factor in rectal cancer, but not independent. However, authors conclude that flow cytometry could help in early staging of the disease, especially in preoperative diagnosis. Flow cytometry has a prognostic significance with informations on tumoral biology and could contribute to select patients for adjuvant therapy or different surgical techniques."

Results of this survey were compared to results of an earlier survey, held in 1985. Both surveys indicate that there is no consensus on the follow-up of patients at risk of hepatic metastases. Especially the interpretation of unexplained rises in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels leads to much controversy. Only 37% of the hospitals performing liver surgery were willing to perform second-look laparotomies based on CEA only. Also there is no agreement on the maximum number of liver metastases that will justify partial liver resection for cure. Clearly, there is a need for prospective randomized trials on which a more rational policy regarding hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer patients can be based."

PET affected management decisions in seven of 16 patients with metastatic disease. In one of eight patients with pelvic recurrence demonstrated by computed tomography (CT), PET detected unknown pulmonary metastases. In five of eight presacral masses with equivocal CT findings, PET was correct and unexpected distant metastases were detected in one of these patients. In two of three patients with increasing CEA levels and normal pelvic CT findings, pelvic recurrence was identified. Overall, whole-body PET affected management in 14 patients. PET is a valuable tool for staging local recurrence and metastatic disease."

Anatomic imaging modalities such as computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging have deficiencies in imaging each of these cancers that can be complemented or overcome by using radioimmunoscintigraphy. The management of patients with colorectal cancer, in particular, has been aided by developments in immunoscintigraphy. The new, safe, and easy-to-prepare MoAbs make possible an effective form of colon and rectal cancer imaging that has been used for (1) staging primary colorectal tumors in presurgical patients, (2) determining extent of disease, (3) continuing surveillance of patients at risk for recurrence of disease, (4) managing patients with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels (even those with otherwise negative workup results), and (5) imaging for occult, disease in patients both before and after surgery.

Seven patients with primary or recurrent gastrointestinal cancer in whom liver metastases were also detected were studied. Accumulation of radioactivity in the primary tumor was seen in only one patient. Visualization of the liver metastases was achieved in all patients. Thus detection of liver metastasis was better than in primary or recurrent tumors. While tumor visualization was most often seen in the 3 day image, optimal visualization of the tumor was seen at 5-7 days. There was no correlation between the serum concentration of CEA or CA19-9 and the visualization of tumors. Serum kinetics of I-131 IMACIS-1 showed biexponential components with a 1st phase T1/2 of 5.0 hours and 2nd phase T1/2 of 34.7 hours. The mean whole body (I-131) half-life determined from the whole-body scans was 1.95 days. The mean urinary excretion of I-131 in 7 days was 85%. This value agreed closely with total radioactivity retention detected by scanning.

CD011134,0,7715897,0,Pretargetted imaging of colorectal cancer recurrences using an 111In-labelled bivalent hapten and a bispecific antibody conjugate.,"In 11 patients recurrence of colorectal cancer was suspected by a rise in serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (nine cases), by a subocclusive clinical situation (one case) or by endoscopy (on an anastomosis, one case). Two-step tumour targetting was performed by a first injection of 0.1 mg kg-1 of unlabelled bispecific antibody conjugate (an anti-CEA Fab' fragment chemically coupled to an anti-diethylene triamine pentaacetate (DTPA)-indium fragment) followed 4 to 5 days later by injection of the bivalent DTPA hapten labelled with 5 to 8 mCi 111In. Planar scintigraphy, single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) 360 degrees acquisitions and whole-body scans were obtained 4.5 and 24 h after injection of the radiolabelled hapten. Biodistribution was determined for eight patients at 48 h. The final diagnosis was confirmed histologically in nine patients (eight by second-look surgery, one by laparotomy). Overall, results were one true negative (1-year follow-up) and 10 true positive; however, for the three large liver metastases (3 to 6 cm), only the periphery of the metastasis had high uptake compared to normal liver. For pelvic recurrences, immunoscintigraphic (IS) contrast was better for small tumours. The highest tumour uptake was found for a 1 cm diameter pelvic recurrence (7.2% i.d. kg-1). Mean tumour-to-blood ratios were 6.4. Thus, this two-step tumour targetting technique, which uses a bispecific antibody conjugate and an 111In-labelled bivalent hapten injected sequentially without chasing the excess bispecific antibody, provided satisfactory results in this preliminary clinical trial for detection of recurrent colorectal cancers."

Among these tumor markers, serum 2H6 antigen levels alone were significantly elevated in patients with early stage (I and II) gastric cancer. Furthermore, combining the measurement for serum 2H6 with CA19-9 increased the percentage of gastric cancer slightly. No correlation between 2H6 antigen and these other tumor markers was observed. The serum levels of 2H6 antigen were monitored post-surgically in 11 patients for 12 weeks and they were found to diminish gradually. The findings suggest that the measurement of serum 2H6 antigen may be a useful marker for an early stage of gastric cancer."

Twenty-two (34%) carcinomas showed an apical and 42 (66%) a cytoplasmic staining pattern. Carcinomas with a cytoplasmic pattern had a higher incidence of lymph node (71 versus 41%; p < 0.05) and liver (50 versus 23%; p < 0.05) metastasis and higher levels of serum CEA (p < 0.01) than those with an apical staining pattern. Nine of 11 recurrent tumors had a cytoplasmic pattern and 2 had an apical pattern (p < 0.05). Among carcinomas having the same degree of differentiation, those with a cytoplasmic CEA staining pattern were more aggressive. Six (55%) well-differentiated carcinomas with a cytoplasmic pattern metastasized to the liver while none with an apical pattern did (p < 0.05). Moderately differentiated carcinomas with a cytoplasmic pattern had a significantly higher incidence of lymph node metastasis than those with an apical pattern (77 versus 46%; p < 0.05). When colorectal carcinomas are examined at the invasive tumor margin, an evaluation of the CEA staining pattern is useful in recognizing carcinomas having a higher potential to metastasize and recur after curative surgery."

Total-body, planar, and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were performed within 6 hours of injection. Objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of the 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA antibody, to assess sensitivity and specificity of the agent in known lesions, and to detect occult disease. The impact of antibody study on subsequent surgery was also evaluated. The Fab' fragment has a molecular weight of 54,000 and is supplied as a lyophilized kit that can be instantaneously labeled with 20 to 30 mCi of [99mTc]pertechnetate. In 9 patients with known disease, planar spot imaging identified lesions in 7 (78% sensitivity), SPECT imaging detected lesions in 8 (88% sensitivity), and 1 patient did not have SPECT. In the group of 10 patients with occult (or equivocal) disease, planar imaging sensitivity was 50%, and SPECT sensitivity was 100%. Analysis by site showed 14 of 24 lesions detected by planar imaging (58% sensitivity), and SPECT detected 24 of 24 lesions (100% sensitivity). Tumors as small as .5 cm were visualized in the 19 patients studied. The surgeon judged the antibody study to be impact neutral in 73% of the cases and helpful in 27% of the cases when antibody study altered the presurgical plan."
CD011134,0,8508386,0,In-111 CYT-103 monoclonal antibody imaging in patients with suspected recurrent colorectal cancer.,"Recurrent colorectal cancer is seen in as many as 40% of patients after curative resection. In view of the limitations of endoscopic and cross-sectional imaging, external immunoscintigraphy has been added to the follow-up regimen of patients at high-risk of recurrent disease. The authors investigated the utility of immunoscintigraphy with Indium-111 (In-111) CYT-103 (site specifically labeled conjugate of monoclonal antibody B72.3) in 19 patients with suspected recurrences after previous curative resection of colorectal carcinoma. Local or regional recurrences (4 patients) and liver metastasis (6 patients) were indicated by physical examination and computed tomography (CT), whereas nine patients had occult disease with increasing serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and negative conventional workups. Serum CEA levels were elevated (mean, 22 ng/ml) in all patients. Approximately 4.3 mCi In-111 labeled to 1.0 mg CYT-103 was administered intravenously to each patient. Planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging were performed 2-5 days after infusion. The final diagnosis of recurrence or metastasis was established in 18 patients by second-look surgery or biopsy. One patient died before exploration. Tumor was identified at the following locations: pelvis (12 patients), abdominal wall (2 patients), retroperitoneum (1 patient), liver (5 patients), and omentum (2 patients). Superiority of monoclonal antibody (MoAb) scan is noted in the detection of pelvic and intraabdominal recurrences (100%) versus CT scan (43%). Liver metastases were identified with equal facility by both modalities. In-111 CYT-103 scan findings influenced the management of 10 (55%) of 18 patients. Surgery was avoided in one patient with disseminated metastases detected by the scan. Correct identification of occult local recurrences was made in six patients. An isolated liver metastasis was confirmed in one patient with equivocal CT scan. Finally, additional intraabdominal lesions were detected in two patients. These results suggest an important and beneficial role for In-111 CYT-103 MoAb imaging in patients with suspected recurrent colorectal carcinomas, particularly in patients in whom cross-sectional imaging is negative; such imaging may prevent patients from undergoing unnecessary surgical exploration."
CD011134,0,8508370,0,Comparison of doubling times of serum carcinoembryonic antigen produced by various metastatic lesions in recurrent gastric and colorectal carcinomas.,"The authors measured the serial serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in patients with recurrent gastric or colorectal carcinoma. Among the 45 patients with recurrent gastric carcinomas, those with lung metastases showed the most prolonged CEA doubling time (CEA-DT), followed by those with liver and peritoneal metastases, respectively. Of the 31 patients with recurrent colorectal carcinomas, those with local recurrence showed the most prolonged CEA-DT, followed by those with lung, liver, and peritoneal metastases, respectively. A positive correlation was observed for gastric and colorectal carcinomas between CEA-DT in patients with metastatic lesions and outcome (R = 0.84 and 0.93, respectively). The results of the current study suggest that postoperative measurement of CEA-DT is useful in the determination of region of recurrence of carcinoma, which would permit early surgery and chemotherapy. Measurement of CEA-DT also may be helpful for the accurate determination of prognosis."
CD011134,0,8491320,0,Somatostatin inhibits both in-vitro and in-vivo carcinoembryonic antigen secretion by human colon cancer.,"This study investigated the effect of SMS 201.995 on CEA secretion of human colon cancer cell lines in vitro and as xenografts in nude mice. Using the two cell lines which secreted significant amounts of CEA in the media, there was a 40% and 54% decrease in CEA level at 2e-10M and 2e-9M concentrations of SMS 201.995, respectively, after five days of incubation for LIM 2412 cell line (P < 0.05, both). There was a 13% decrease in CEA at 2e-9M concentration of SMS with the LoVo cell line (P > 0.05). In vivo, there was a direct correlation between the mean volume of the LIM 2412 xenografts and serum CEA level (r = 0.92). When the growth of xenografts was inhibited by SMS, there was a corresponding drop in serum CEA. On the other hand, when tumor sizes remained unchanged, whether after a short duration of SMS treatment or with the oral route, serum CEA was unaffected. Thus, CEA concentration reflected cell number in vitro and tumor size in vivo as a response to treatment with SMS 201.995. The CEA level may therefore be a useful marker during somatostatin treatment to monitor tumor response."
CD011134,0,8490911,0,Comparative evaluation of serum CA 195 and carcinoembryonic antigen in metastatic carcinoma.,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a well-described human tumor-associated antigen most useful clinically in colon cancer. However, the clinical usefulness of CEA is limited by the marker's overall poor specificity and low sensitivity in patients with minimal disease. CA 195 is a recently discovered human tumor-associated glycoprotein that can be measured in serum using an immunoradiometric assay. CA 195 is expressed on the membrane of human colon cancer cells and shares an epitope with the Lewis A blood group antigens. The authors initiated a study to compare the clinical utility of serum CA 195 with CEA in patients with advanced cancer. A control population was studied to assess the effects of age, gender, alcohol, and tobacco on the measured levels of serum CA 195."
CD011134,0,8474293,0,[Extended resection of liver metastases in colorectal cancer].,"Over a 10-year period, 166 patients underwent liver resection with curative intent for colorectal secondaries. These included 23 (13.8%) with metastases invading to adjacent organs. Diaphragm (n = 9), major omentum (n = 5), portal vein/inferior vena cava (n = 3), gallbladder/extrahepatic biliary system (n = 3), right adrenal gland (n = 2), and lymph nodes of the hepatoduodenal ligament (n = 1) were resected en bloc together with the metastases. Operative mortality was 4.3% (1/23 patients). Intraoperative findings and the pathologist's report led to the performance of R0 resection in 14 patients, and microscopic residual disease after R1 resection was found in 7 patients; in 2 cases macroscopically visible tumour had to be left behind. Median survival for all patients was 14 months and was significantly less favourable than in patients who had undergone resection of metastases confined to the liver (P = 0.011, long-rank test). The median recurrence-free interval was 6.8 months (P = 0.11). Obviously, patients who had undergone R0 resection and whose CEA serum levels returned to normal after operation benefited the most, and among these a median survival of 17 months was recorded. It is concluded that in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer, invasion of the metastases to adjacent organs has significant implications for the prognosis, even if the metastases are resected. It is important to detect this situation preoperatively, to avoid subjecting patients to a treatment that offers little benefit."

CEA102 was labeled with 131I by the chloramine-T or the Iodogen method, and administered i.v. to 20 patients with liver metastases, local recurrences, and/or primary tumors. Planar scintigraphy was performed during 5 or 6 postinfusion days. Hypersensitivity reactions such as fever and chill occurred in 4 patients, but no side effects were noted after endotoxin was excluded. Overall sensitivity was 71.4% (primary tumor 4/4, liver metastasis 5/6, lymph node metastasis 1/1, local recurrence 5/10), and no false positive was observed. In the cases of local recurrences, this method was useful to distinguish postoperative fibrosis from local recurrence. These results revealed that radiolabeled CEA102 has a great potential in qualitative diagnosis of colorectal cancer."

When a third hepatic recurrence was diagnosed, further surgery was considered technically impossible, and the patient was given chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid. He went into complete remission, and seven and a half years after the resection for colorectal cancer no metastases in the liver can be shown by ultrasonography or CT scan. The patient has normal CEA, and is at work."
CD011134,0,8449134,0,Does methodic long-term follow-up affect survival after curative resection of colorectal carcinoma?,"Records of 487 patients in long-term follow-up after Ro resection of colorectal carcinomas between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1989 were analyzed. Every patient underwent regular examinations according to a defined schedule after curative resection of colorectal carcinoma. The date of evaluation was June 31, 1991. During a median observation time of 48 months (range, 15-132 months), tumor recurrence was observed in 149 patients (30.6 percent), with 56.4 percent of these suffering from tumor-associated symptoms. As the primary manifestation of tumor recurrence, only distant metastases (DM) were found in 76 patients (51 percent), only local recurrence (LR) in 46 patients (30.9 percent), and both DM and LR in 27 patients (18.1 percent). Patients with rectal carcinoma developed LR more frequently (P < 0.05) (19.5 percent) than patients with colon carcinoma (11.8 percent). The probability of developing distant metastases was not different (P < 0.05) for colon or rectal carcinoma but depended on primary tumor stage (P < 0.05). Only 36 patients (24.2 percent) with recurrence could undergo further curative resection. Fifty patients (33.5 percent) were given palliative therapy, and 63 patients (42.3 percent) were given no oncologic treatment. Only 9 of the 36 patients (6 percent of all recurrence patients) undergoing Ro resection were free of tumor for more than two years. In no case was a third Ro resection possible. The survival time of these patients was increased significantly after Ro resection of tumor recurrence (P = 0.03). Our study suggests that only a very few patients may live longer as a result of regular follow-up programs after curative resection for colorectal carcinoma."
CD011134,0,8449074,0,Occult cancer in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. A prospective study.,"We prospectively studied 78 consecutive patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) to determine the most appropriate workup study for searching for hidden cancer. After a careful physical examination, the following tests were performed: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), complete blood cell counts, biochemistry, carcinoembryonic antigen levels, chest radiograph, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and abdominal ultrasound. If a malignant lesion was suspected, further appropriate tests were performed. After hospital discharge, periodic follow-up was performed on all patients in our outpatient clinic. A malignant lesion was detected in 9 of 78 patients: in 7 of them, cancer was diagnosed during the hospital admission because of acute PE. All but one of these 7 patients were asymptomatic, except for PE symptoms. In three of them some abnormalities on physical examination led to the diagnosis of cancer; in the remaining three patients the diagnosis was suspected from abnormal results of blood tests. Cancer was detected several months after hospital discharge in two additional patients: an esophageal cancer was diagnosed 5 months later in one of the 23 patients who refused endoscopy; and a colonic carcinoma was detected 21 months after hospital discharge in a patient in whom colonoscopy was not performed at the time of hospital admission. When considered overall, cancer was more commonly found in patients with ""idiopathic"" PE as compared with patients with known risk factors for PE development (6 of 21 patients vs 3 of 51 patients; p < 0.05). On the other hand, one patient died because of massive recurrent PE after a biopsy sample was obtained because of a prostatic node. Gross hematuria had developed shortly after biopsy, and any attempt to increase heparin doses was followed by recurrent hematuria. According to our experience, any decision about procedures that potentially involve bleeding should be carefully individualized in patients with acute PE."
CD011134,0,8441054,0,Immunoscintigraphy in the surgical management of colorectal cancer.,"The role of immunoscintigraphy in patients with colorectal cancer is being defined in ongoing clinical trials. Currently, most follow-up examination after ""curative"" resection of colorectal carcinoma are performed by surgeons, oncologists and gastroenterologists. They are largely focused on detecting recurrent intraluminal disease and measuring serial serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Although rising CEA is often indicative of nonresectable disease, some patients with elevated CEA levels have no evidence of recurrent disease using conventional diagnostic modalities. In these patients, immunoscintigraphy will probably have a major diagnostic role. In addition, immunoscintigraphy may become valuable in screening patients at high risk for recurrence postoperatively, such as those with Dukes' stage C lesions, aneuploidy, poor tumor differentiation or tumor adhesion to or invasion of adjacent organs. Immunoscintigraphy may allow earlier diagnosis of recurrent disease and permit more targeted follow-up studies. Intensive, timely follow-up of these patients should lead to early detection of recurrent disease at a time when these lesions are still resectable."
CD011134,0,8441053,0,Current imaging strategies for colorectal cancer.,"Endoscopy and barium enema examinations are used to identify the primary site of disease in patients with clinical suspicion of colorectal cancer. Once colorectal cancer has been confirmed by imaging studies and biopsy, preoperative evaluation is directed toward accurate disease staging. Most currently available imaging techniques are inaccurate for detecting transmural extension, perienteric spread of tumors and distant lymph node involvement. Although both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have an unacceptably low sensitivity for accurate staging, CT is clearly superior to MRI for detecting extrahepatic metastases. Transrectal ultrasonography, however, is a promising new method for detecting perirectal spread of disease. The diagnostic efficacy of MRI and intravenous dynamic hepatic CT for detecting liver metastases is approximately equal. CT during arterial portography is recommended before resection of solitary liver metastases. Chest radiography is also part of the routine preoperative evaluation. Bone scans are rarely performed in patients without the skeletal pain suggestive of bone metastases. During the years following surgery for colorectal cancer, many patients undergo special imaging studies to identify local tumor recurrence, secondary tumor growth elsewhere within the large bowel and both regional and distant spread of disease. Thus, for the patient with a sharply increasing carcinoembryonic antigen level, CT of the abdomen and liver is the current recommendation. Immunoscintigraphy is a new imaging modality that addresses some of the limitations of current diagnostic procedures for colorectal cancer. This procedure gives whole body information on disease extent, especially in the extrahepatic abdomen and pelvis, and can therefore contribute to patient management decisions."
CD011134,0,8439505,0,Dynamic test with recombinant interferon-alpha-2b: effect on 90K and other tumour-associated antigens in cancer patients without evidence of disease.,"We have previously shown that a short course of recombinant interferon-alpha-2b (rIFN-alpha-2b) (3 million units day for 5 days) for patients with primary gynaecologic malignancies was able to increase the circulating levels of a newly discovered tumour associated antigen, termed 90K. In this study, we have investigated the effects of the same modality of administration of rIFN-alpha-2b in 62 patients with breast and colorectal cancer whose primary tumour was surgically removed 1 month before and who were without evidence of disease (NED) at the time of the study. A significant increase of 90K serum concentration was already observed 24 h after the first r-IFN-alpha-2b injection and persisted throughout the investigational period. The increase was more pronounced in patients with a basal 90K-negative than a 90K-positive assay. Of 54 patients who started the test with a 90K negative assay, 17 (31%) shifted to a positive assay after rIFN-alpha-2b. Twenty-eight of 62 (45%) patients exhibited a 90K value above the mean increment of the whole population. The serum levels of CEA, CA-15-3, CA 19-9, and alpha-fetoprotein measured in the same serum samples were not modified. After 2 years of follow-up, ten patients relapsed. Six of them showed a 90K increase above the mean increment of the whole population. As with ovarian cancer, the increase of 90K following r-IFN-alpha-2b administration might be of importance for the early detection of disease recurrence in clinically NED breast and colon cancer patients."
CD011134,0,8422179,0,[A case of bilateral pulmonary metastasis from rectal cancer successfully treated with resection after high-dose 5'-DFUR plus MMC combination chemotherapy].,"We reported a case of successful treatment of bilateral pulmonary metastasis from rectal cancer with high-dose 5'-DFUR plus MMC combination chemotherapy. A woman born in 1948 showed a recurrence in the bilateral lung about 29 months after low anterior resection. High-dose 5'-DFUR plus MMC combination chemotherapy was started in March, 1991. The chest X-ray examination 8 weeks after beginning this therapy showed a remarkable decrease in the size of the pulmonary metastatic foci and CEA decreased in the same way. The dose of 5'-DFUR was reduced after 5 courses, and then CEA increased. No remarkable side effect was encountered and the patient could be safely treated at an outpatient clinic. During this therapy no recurrence has been detected, and we performed a resection of the bilateral pulmonary metastasis by median sternotomy in October, 1991. The above findings suggested that this was an effective and safe therapy for pulmonary metastasis from colon cancers and could be a neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for surgical resection of pulmonary metastasis."
CD011134,0,8405479,0,"A comparative analysis of the serum levels of NCC-ST-439, CEA and CA19-9 in patients with colorectal carcinoma.","To investigate the usefulness of NCC-ST-439 (ST439) as a new tumor marker in colorectal cancer, we compared its serum level with the serum levels of CEA and CA19-9. The serum levels of ST439, CEA and CA19-9 from 168 patients were evaluated, of which 124 were primary cases and 44 were recurrent. ST439 was elevated in 31.5% in primary cases and 52.3% in newly-discovered carcinoma patients with confirmed recurrent cases. Following resection of the tumor, ST439 levels decreased rapidly. Similar trends in serial CEA and CA19-9 levels were found. While CEA is more sensitive for the detection of colorectal carcinomas than the other two markers, ST439 is sensitive in the detection of localized carcinomas and recurrent cases with localized lesions or liver metastasis. The results indicate that ST439 is a useful tumor marker not only for diagnosing primary carcinomas, but also for the detection of recurrent cases."

Technetium-99m radiolabelled 1A3, a monoclonal antibody against a columnar cell surface antigen, was used. No adverse effects or thyroid uptake was observed in 127 studies. The 85 primary colorectal cancers were all image positive. In the assessment of recurrent tumour in the abdomen or pelvis, the accuracy was 33/35 (94%), including true-positive findings in some whose serum carcinoembryonic antigen was normal. There was a positive predictive value for abdominal or pelvic recurrence of 92% and a negative predictive value of 100%, at a prevalence of 66%. In those patients whose liver was able to be evaluated, the accuracy was 72/79 (91%). There was a positive predictive value for liver metastases of 88% and a negative predictive value of 93%, at a prevalence of 32%.

CD011134,0,8404384,0,Anticarcinoembryonic antigen immunoscintigraphy with a 99mTc-Fab' fragment (Immu 4) in primary and recurrent colorectal cancer. A prospective study.,"Forty-seven patients were submitted to 68 radioimmunoscintigraphic investigations for primary or recurrent colorectal cancer. Immunoscintigraphy with Immu-4 correctly detected 28 primary colorectal cancers of 29 and 12 of 12 recurrent colorectal cancers. Overall accuracy was 93.75 percent in primary and 91.6 percent in recurrent colorectal cancer. Immunoscintigraphy had a decisive influence on treatment planning in every third primary colorectal cancer patient and was by far superior to CT scan in the detection of early recurrences, especially in patients with a history of abdominoperineal or low anterior resection. Immu-4 scintigraphy is a safe and convenient diagnostic approach to colorectal cancer. Because radioactivity is acceptably low and the method is absolutely free of side effects, there are no objections to the repeated use of immunoscintigraphy which provides important information in primary diagnosis as well as in the follow-up of colorectal cancer patients."
CD011134,0,8403703,0,Role of In-111 labeled CYT-103 immunoscintigraphy in the evaluation of patients with recurrent colorectal carcinoma.,"An immunoconjugate of the whole antibody, B72.3, has been approved by the FDA. It is labeled with indium-111, which allows imaging studies intended for the diagnosis and staging of colorectal and recurrent ovarian carcinoma. The new diagnostic imaging agent (CYT-103), Oncoscint CR/OV, has found particular use in evaluating patients with recurrent carcinoma. The three major indications for the study are: 1) occult disease--unexplained rise in serum tumor markers (e.g. CEA), with negative work-up including CT; 2) known local recurrence (e.g. liver or rectal area)--surgery is planned, but there is a need to rule out other areas of involvement; 3) clarify equivocal CT or MRI finding--to distinguish whether an abnormality is due to recurrent tumor or scar tissue, fibrosis, or unopacified bowel loop. Oncoscint has proven to be more sensitive than CT in the detection of disease in the pelvis and extrahepatic abdomen. CT remains the modality of choice for the detection of liver metastases. The combined sensitivity of the two modalities is 88% on a per-patient basis."
CD011134,0,8396907,0,[Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization to hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer].,"Response of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TAE) and transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy to hepatic metastases was reported in 25 cases of colorectal cancer. The severity of liver metastases was H1 in 12 cases, H2 in 9 cases, and H3 in 4 cases. Liver metastases were found during surgery in 12 of these patients, and 13 showed metastases or recurrence in the liver after resections of primary lesions. Catheters were inserted selectively to the proper hepatic artery by Seldinger's method, followed by injection of embolizing agents (gelfoam particles of Lipiodol) with adriamycin or 5-FU + leucovorin in most cases. Response was assessed by blood CEA levels, diagnostic imaging, and period of survival. In 5 cases in whom liver resections were performed following TAE, response was assessed by histopathological findings of the resected specimens. Two patients showed partial response (PR), 12 no change (NC) and 11 progressive disease (PD) by diagnostic imaging. Blood CEA levels fell to less than 50% of pre-treatment levels in 26% of cases. Histological changes by TAE were confirmed in 4 of 5 cases after liver resections, but viable cancer cells were observed in all cases. A case of mucinous cancer showed no change histologically. As the other case of mucinous cancer showed PD by diagnostic imaging, TAE was not suggested to be suitable to treat cases of mucinous cancer. More improvements in the dosage, drugs and times of treatment were suggested to yield a better response rate in TAE therapy for liver metastases from colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,8389662,0,Monoclonal antibody imaging in patients with colorectal cancer and increasing levels of serum carcinoembryonic antigen. Experience with ZCE-025 and IMMU-4 monoclonal antibodies and proposed directions for clinical trials.,"In an effort to identify the site of recurrent colorectal cancer in patients with occult metastasis and increasing serum CEA levels, we conducted two trials using monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) against CEA. The first utilized Indium-111-labeled ZCE-025; an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) anticarcinoembryonic antigen (anti-CEA) antibody (Hybritech, San Diego, CA). The second study used Tc-99m-labeled Fab' fragment of IMMU-4 (Immunomedics, Morris Plains, NJ). Eighteen patients were imaged with the ZCE-025 and 14 with the Tc-99m Fab' IMMU-4. True-positive scans, defined as at least one correct correlation of the MoAb scan and surgical/histologic findings, were observed in 12 of 15 patients undergoing exploration or biopsy using the ZCE-025 and 11 of 14 using the IMMU-4. There were no true-negative scans with the ZCE-025 and only 2 of 14 with the IMMU-4. There were 3 false-positive scans with the ZCE-025 and 1 of 14 with IMMU-4. There were no false-negative scans with either ZCE-025 or IMMU-4. Four (31%) of 13 patients undergoing exploration and imaged with ZCE-025 and 5 (36%) of 14 imaged with IMMU-4 had complete tumor resection. Treatment decisions were affected in 3 (16%) of 18 ZCE-025-imaged patients and 3 (21%) of 14 IMMU-4 ones. Two (14%) of 14 patients imaged with IMMU-4 had negative MoAb scans and negative laparotomies. Despite these findings, it is not known whether such early detection and resection will translate into improved survival rates. The authors suggest two randomized studies, one designed to ascertain the role of MoAb added to blind exploratory laparotomy. In that study, patients with increasing CEA levels and a negative workup will be randomized to an exploratory laparotomy preceded by MoAb anti-CEA scans or a straight exploratory laparotomy without the assistance of a MoAb anti-CEA scan. Endpoints will be differences in complete resectability and survival. A second study will examine the merits of blind exploratory laparotomies. In that study, patients with increasing CEA levels and a negative workup would be randomized to MoAb imaging, exploratory laparotomy, and radioimmunoguided surgery, and the other cohort of patients would continue to have conventional radiologic workup. Exploration in this latter group would be performed only when indicated by radiologic or endoscopic studies. The endpoint of the study would compare survival in the two cohorts of patients. These two studies may ultimately settle the debate regarding the correct approach to patients with occult metastatic colorectal cancer and a increasing levels of serum CEA."
CD011134,0,8379680,0,[A case of postoperative pulmonary metastasis of colon cancer which responded to treatment with leucovorin and 5-FU].,"A 72-year-old man underwent a radical operation for sigmoid colon cancer (well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, stage III) in 1989. Chest X-ray examination performed in September 1992 showed multiple nodular shadows in the lungs. A diagnosis of pulmonary metastasis was made from abnormally increased CEA and CA 19-9 and findings by chest tomography and CT scanning. There was no evidence of metastasis or recurrence in the liver, bone, brain or large intestine. He received three courses of bolus injections of leucovorin (30 mg/body) and 5-FU (500 mg/body), each over five consecutive days with a two-week rest period, and subsequently weekly at the same doses. CEA and CA 19-9 levels started to decrease after completion of the second course of consecutive treatment. In week 18 of chemotherapy, CEA and CA 19-9 levels dropped to 5.6 ng/ml and 32 U/ml from 66 ng/ml and 130 U/ml, respectively. Chest tomography and chest CT showed the disappearance or reduction in size of the nodules, with a reduction rate of 87.1%. Twenty-two weeks later, at this writing, there was no evidence of disease progression, and the patient was thus judged to be PR. He continues to receive chemotherapy at our outpatient clinic."
CD011134,0,8375221,0,Role of carcinoembryonic antigen in predicting resectability of recurrent colorectal cancer.,"The reported low resectability rate for patients with recurrent colorectal cancer who have carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels > 11 has led us to perform this study. One hundred twenty-four patients who underwent Radioimmunoguided Surgery (RIGS) procedures for recurrent colorectal cancer from 1986 to the present were studied. In surgery, all patients underwent a traditional exploration followed by survey with a hand-held, gamma-detecting probe to detect preinjected radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies attached to cancer cells. Sites of metastases included: 72 liver (58.1 percent), 23 pelvis (18.5 percent), 15 distant lymph nodes (12.1 percent), 2 anastomotic (1.6 percent), and 12 other sites (9.7 percent). The resectability rate was 43.5 percent (54 patients). The mean preoperative CEA level for patients with resectable disease was significantly lower than for patients with unresectable disease (P = 0.017): unresectable--mean, 87.1; SD, 141.0; minimum, 0.3; maximum, 501; resectable--mean, 36.6; SD, 59.3; minimum, 0.3; maximum, 329. The CEA level for patients with liver metastasis did not vary significantly from those patients without metastasis: 70 vs. 58.2 (P = 0.58). Those patients with resectable liver tumors had lower mean CEA levels than those with unresectable liver, approaching significance: 41.6 vs. 91.9 (P = 0.065). Other metastatic sites had a mean CEA level of: pelvic, 72.6; distant lymph nodes, 47.8; anastomotic, 2.7; and other sites, 53.8. These data suggest that there is a significant difference between the preoperative CEA level of the resectable and unresectable recurrent colorectal cancer patients, but the large standard deviation does not justify abandonment of exploration for any CEA level."
CD011134,0,8374868,0,TAG-72 (CA 72-4 assay) as a complementary serum tumor antigen to carcinoembryonic antigen in monitoring patients with colorectal cancer.,"Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the most frequently chosen tumor marker in the clinical diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma and in the long-term monitoring of patients after tumor resection. In recent years, monoclonal antibody technology has identified several new markers of neoplasia, two of which, TAG-72 and CA 19-9, are found in the sera of patients with adenocarcinoma. Serum CEA, TAG-72, and CA 19-9 were evaluated in 300 patients with either malignant (n = 200) or benign (n = 100) colorectal disease."
CD011134,0,8373216,0,[Measurement of bile CEA levels in patients with colorectal cancer: is it of value for diagnosis of occult liver metastases aiming at prophylactic regional hepatic chemotherapy?].,"A preliminary study was conducted to determine whether the measurement of CEA levels in gallbladder bile would be of value for diagnosis of occult liver metastases aiming at prophylactic regional hepatic chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer. Forty-fold dilution by normal human sera was necessary to measure CEA levels of gallbladder bile by the enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Bile CEA levels were 27.2 +/- 30.4 (M +/- SD) ng/ml in patients with benign biliary diseases (control), 248.5 +/- 426.3 ng/ml (p < 0.05, vs. control) in Dukes B, C patients, and 3,331.5 +/- 4,473.3 ng/ml (p < 0.01 vs. control, p < 0.05 vs. Dukes B, C) in patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer, respectively. Bile CEA tended to demonstrate the existence of hepatic metastases more accurately than serum CEA. Our results obtained from a small number of patients suggest that patients with either elevation of bile CEA level or with a high ratio of bile CEA/serum CEA may be candidates for hepatic recurrence that requires prophylactic hepatic chemotherapy. However, it may be difficult to determine the bile CEA level at which occult liver metastases are demonstrated."
CD011134,0,8368446,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen assay of intra-abdominal fine-needle aspirates.,"Differentiating abscesses from necrotic tumors has important therapeutic implications. Currently, cytologic examination is the ""gold standard,"" but it has a low sensitivity for cystic/necrotic tumors. To address this problem, a prospective study was conducted comparing the results of cytologic examination with those of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) immunoassay of fine-needle aspirates in 24 patients undergoing radiologically or surgically guided fine-needle aspiration. Of 26 fine-needle aspirates, 20 were malignant and 6 benign. Final results were correlated with pathologic examination (when available), clinical review, and follow-up. Three patients had an abscess associated with perforated, recurrent carcinoma, of whom only one had cytologic assessment prior to drainage. The sensitivity of fine-needle aspiration was 85%, and for adenocarcinoma alone, 80%. CEA sensitivity (greater than 5 ng/mL) was 50%, and for adenocarcinoma, 90%; the specificity of the assay was 64%. A high CEA level alone was diagnostic of metastatic carcinoma of the colon in two fine-needle aspirates. Cytologic assessment and CEA assay of fine-needle aspirates and cyst/abscess drainage facilitate the diagnosis of unsuspected adenocarcinoma."
CD011134,0,8366298,0,Immunoscintigraphy in colorectal cancer: surgeon's perspective.,"External immunoscintigraphy (IS) is a new imaging tool to diagnose, stage and follow-up solid malignancies. Monoclonal antibodies are raised to tumor-associated antigens, radiolabeled and when injected in the patient localize to the tumor. Detection is with nuclear medicine gamma camera. In colorectal cancer, immunoscintigraphy can be beneficial to the surgeon. With primary colorectal carcinoma, IS detects synchronous primaries, identifies lymph node metastasis, determines extent of disease and detects occult metastasis. Postoperatively, in high-risk patients (Dukes B2, B3 and C lesions) IS assists in the follow-up for recurrence. Particular advantage with IS is seen in pelvic, mesenteric and retroperitoneal recurrences. Rising serum CEA and negative conventional cross-sectional imaging can often be clarified as to site of disease with IS. IS contributes significantly to surgical decision making with alterations in management based on radiolabeled monoclonal antibody scans in 25-32% of primary and recurrent colorectal cancer cases."

CD011134,0,8324338,0,Adrenal metastasis from carcinoma of the colon and rectum: a report of three cases.,"We report herein three cases of patients with adrenal metastases from colorectal carcinoma. Recurrent disease was suspected following markedly elevated levels of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and adrenal metastases were confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scanning in all three patients. The adrenal metastasis was solitary in one patient and this patient is still alive and free from disease 1 year after undergoing complete removal of the adrenal metastasis. On the other hand, metastatic disease was not limited to the adrenal gland in the other two patients and both died of recurrent disease, 33 months and 4 months after undergoing removal of the adrenal metastases, respectively. Thus, although the prognosis of adrenal metastasis from colorectal cancer is usually poor, we believe that patients with a solitary adrenal metastasis will benefit from complete removal of the metastasis."
CD011134,0,8314389,0,Immunoscintigraphy with 99mTc-labelled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody in colorectal carcinoma.,"With the introduction of immunoscintigraphy (IS) with 99mTc-labelled anti-CEA monoclonal antibodies (MoAb), a clinical relevant method in nuclear medicine can be expected in the diagnosis and follow up of colorectal cancers. We performed IS (whole body, planar and SPECT) with a 99mTc-labelled intact anti-CEA MoAb (BW 431/26) in 18 patients with primary colorectal carcinoma, metastases or suspicious recurrences from colorectal carcinoma. The results of anti-CEA IS, serum CEA and Ca 19-9 levels were evaluated. Immunoscintigraphy yielded an overall sensitivity of 70.0%, 37.5% for primary tumors, 75.0% for recurrences and 100% for distant metastases. Serum CEA levels were elevated in 10 out of 18 patients (sensitivity 55.5%) and Ca 19-9 were elevated in eight out of 18 patients (sensitivity 44.4%). In the group of patients with metastases, CEA had a sensitivity of 100% and Ca 19-9, of 83.3%. From this prospective study, we can conclude that IS with 99mTC-BW 431/26 is a reliable tool in the post-operative follow-up study of patients with colorectal carcinoma, namely in the detection of distant metastases."
CD011134,0,8272763,1,Modelling of serial carcinoembryonic antigen changes in colorectal cancer.,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a tumour marker mainly used for detection of recurrent colorectal cancer. CEA series in 295 patients, who had a macroscopic radical resection of a primary colorectal cancer were studied. A kinetic model was fitted to CEA series of individual patients. Applying the kinetic model recurrences were identified with a sensitivity of 70-80% and specificity of 80-90%. Simulations were performed in order to find the optimal sampling strategy for CEA during follow-up. Simulations showed that CEA determinations at a few weeks interval between would be optimal for early detection of recurrences."
CD011134,0,8257047,0,[Local recurrence after surgery for cancer of the rectum].,"Local tumor recurrence rates after curative rectal cancer surgery are reportedly high and herald a poor diagnosis. Extramural recurrence is most common and is due to the failure to remove all of the tumor during the initial operation. In the rarer anastomotic recurrence, the implantation of exfoliated malignant cells is possible, but histochemical changes in the mucosa surrounding a tumor may be considered as an alternative cause of local recurrence. Local recurrence rates did not improve when the distal margins were extended over 2 cm, but microscopic lateral tumor extension appears to be the major determinant of recurrence. Early diagnosis is based on frequent CEA assays, history, physical examination, endoscopy, endoluminal ultrasound and pelvic CT scan. Aggressive treatment involving a combination of field irradiation, surgical debulking and intra-operative radiation can result in local control and long-term survival in 10 to 25% of patients."

A series of examinations showed colon cancer with a malignant duodenocolic fistula. Patient received extended right hemicolectomy with wide local excision of the duodenum (en bloc resection of the tumor). Recovery was smooth without local recurrence or metastasis after a six-month follow-up. Wide en bloc resection provides the only hope of cure in such cases. Treatment with extended right hemicolectomy with Whipple's procedure, or extended right hemicolectomy with extended local wide excision of duodenum, should be chosen, depending upon the extent of tumor invasion."

She was treated for 5 days with a combination of continuous infusion of 5-FU 600 mg/m2/day, bolus injection of leucovorin (LV) 20 mg/m2/day, and intramuscular injection of interferon (IFN)-alpha-2a (6.0 x 10(6) U/day, repeated every 3 weeks. The chest X-ray after three cycles showed a decrease in size of metastatic lesions by 51%, indicating a partial response. Correspondingly, the serum levels of CEA and CA 19-9 significantly decreased. There were modest but tolerable side effects such as fever, nausea, diarrhea, stomatitis, and alopecia. The patient has been given oral UFT and LV after discharge, and is still alive with continued improvement of pulmonary lesions even 9 months after initial chemotherapy. Although the detailed synergistic mechanism of 5-FU and IFN has yet to be determined, the addition of IFN, as a biochemical modulator distinct from LV, to the combination of 5-FU and LV, appears to further potentiate the therapeutic efficacy and may be useful for advanced colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,8233244,0,Radioimmunoscintigraphy of recurrent colorectal carcinoma using 111In-labelled murine monoclonal antibody B72.3: a comparison with contrast-enhanced computed tomography.,"Ten patients underwent contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomographic (CT) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) measurement and murine 111In-B72.3 monoclonal antibody radioimmunoscintigraphy for recurrent or residual colorectal carcinoma. All patients had undergone primary colorectal tumour resection at a median of 3 (range 1-18) months previously. Histological analysis of pelvic tissue biopsies confirmed that six patients had recurrent or residual colorectal cancer and that four were tumour free. Whilst scintigraphy correctly showed all six patients with recurrent or residual disease, both CT and CEA measurement were correct in only four patients. In the four patients without recurrent cancer, CT was correct in two patients whilst scintigraphy and CEA measurement were accurate in three patients. Six out of the 10 patients showed marked nonspecific colonic excretion of radiolabelled antibody which was correctly interpreted in five patients. Future prospective studies comparing CT scans, CEA estimation and B72.3 radioimmunoscintigraphy in a larger group of patients with suspected residual or recurrent colorectal adenocarcinoma may help to define the respective sensitivity and specificity of these techniques."
CD011134,0,8233243,0,Radioimmunoscintigraphy of colorectal carcinoma with a 111In-labelled anti-TAG-72 monoclonal antibody.,"Radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) of colorectal carcinoma with a 111In-labelled anti-TAG-72 monoclonal antibody (CYT-103) has been performed in 24 patients with five primary lesions and 10 suspicious of recurrence (in one of these patients two RIS were made). Histopathological confirmation of the disease and surgical liver examination were carried out in all primary tumours and in 12 possible recurrences. In the remaining eight patients a final diagnosis was established according to the clinical course and other diagnostic procedures. Planar and tomographic scans were obtained at 48 and 72 h postinjection in all patients. All primary tumours were detected by RIS. In the group with recurrences confirmed pathologically the results were nine true positive, two true negative and one false positive in a patient affected only with liver disease. The nine true positive studies corresponded to four positive by computed tomography (CT), four negative by CT and one nonconclusive by CT. Surgical liver examination results were 15 true negative and two false negative. No correlation was found between serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen or TAG-72 and the detection of the lesions. In 10 patients human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) levels were studied. In conclusion, RIS with an anti-TAG-72 monoclonal antibody is a useful technique for the study and localization of colorectal tumours, mainly in cases of recurrence, being also indicated in patients with normal TAG-72 serum levels."
CD011134,0,8223061,1,Usefulness of carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring despite normal preoperative values in node-positive colon cancer patients.,The aim of our study was to determine to what extent serial carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monitoring is helpful in detecting colorectal cancer recurrence in patients if their preoperative serum CEA is normal. Additional major objectives of this study were to correlate CEA immunohistochemical features of the primary tumor with serum CEA levels at the time of tumor recurrence in node-positive colorectal cancer patients with low preoperative CEA values.
CD011134,0,8222254,0,Serum tumor markers for patient monitoring: a case-oriented approach illustrated with carcinoembryonic antigen.,"The effectiveness of patient monitoring with serum tumor markers is improved when the patient's pretreatment baseline is established, regular serial testing is performed, and a clinically significant change of the marker is determined on the basis of objective criteria. Attention must be directed to (a) ensuring long-term assay precision, (b) timing specimen collection to avoid misinterpretation of paradoxical increases (induced by chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation), (c) noting changes in the production or clearance mechanisms of the marker, and (d) recognizing the variability of site-response in patients who have multiple locations of metastatic disease. Clinical decisions to alter therapy should not be based only on tumor marker measurements. In the absence of other clinical data, a tumor marker abnormality should be confirmed with serial samples collected at a time interval dictated by the half-life of the marker. Serial tumor marker testing can improve cancer patient care, especially when effective salvage therapies are available."
CD011134,0,8213219,0,Hyperthermotherapy for postoperative local recurrences of rectal cancer.,"Between November 1984 and August 1992 we used hyperthermotherapy in six cases of local recurrence of rectal cancer. Hyperthermotherapy was performed on the average 8.7 times (range: 3-18) for each patient for 60 min each. All patients underwent combined radiotherapy and received a mean radiation dose of 42.5 Gy (range: 9-60 Gy). Five patients underwent heating within 1 h after irradiation and one patient simultaneously with the irradiation. Four patients underwent combined chemotherapy and two patients immunotherapy. Before the treatment all patients had painful lesions, but pain decreased posttherapeutically in five patients. Performance status improved in two patients. High carcinoembryonic antigen levels prior to the therapy in four patients decreased in all cases after treatment. Posttherapeutical computed tomograms revealed only minor response or no changes. After the treatment, four patients died of exacerbations of recurrent tumors and one patient of distant metastases. The patient who underwent simultaneous radiohyperthermotherapy is presently alive, in August 1992, 38 months after initiation of the treatment. The 50% survival time after initiation of the treatment was 25 months (range: 10-38 months). Hyperthermotherapy combined with radiotherapy, chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy was useful for the alleviation of pain in patients who developed local recurrence after surgery, and improved survival after recurrences can be expected."

Longitudinal series of Carcino-embryonic-antigen were obtained and analyzed with a dynamic model in seven of 16 patients had CEA levels above 10 ng ml-1. Clinical evaluation based on X-ray, ultrasound and CT-scans showed a partial response to the given treatment in three of the seven patients. The dynamic model consistently estimated the maximal accumulated cell kill (approximately three logs) in the patients experiencing a clinical response. The remaining four patients with CEA levels above 10 ng ml-1 showed some reduction in CEA as a consequence of the treatment cycles, although no clinical response could be established. No response was seen among the remaining nine patients with CEA levels below 10 ng ml-1."
CD011134,0,8094079,0,Increased mdr-1/P-glycoprotein expression after treatment of human colon carcinoma cells with P-glycoprotein antagonists.,"We observed increased levels of mdr-1 mRNA and its protein product P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in the human colon carcinoma cell line, LS 180, and its drug-resistant sublines, LS 180-Ad50 and LS 180-Vb2, after treatment with the Pgp antagonists, verapamil, nifedipine, and cyclosporin A. Increases in mdr-1 RNA were observed within 8 h of the addition of the Pgp antagonists and continued to rise over time. Peak levels were attained after several weeks and were sustained for the duration of treatment up to several months, with a rapid decline in mdr-1 mRNA levels after removal of the Pgp antagonist. Corresponding changes in Pgp were demonstrated with addition and removal of the Pgp antagonists. Increased mdr-1 mRNA was also seen with two other calcium channel blockers, nicardipine and diltiazem, but not with the Pgp antagonists, quinidine and chlorpromazine. Treatment with verapamil or nifedipine was associated with electron microscopic changes consistent with increased differentiation and resulted in increased carcinoembryonic antigen expression, suggesting that the increase in mdr-1 expression was associated with the process of differentiation. Nuclear runoff experiments and inhibition of new RNA synthesis with actinomycin D treatment failed to detect an increase in mdr-1 transcription or stabilization of the mdr-1 mRNA suggesting that the effect of these agents is mediated posttranscriptionally within the nucleus."

After 43 initial anterior resections (AR), the treatment of recurrence was in 19 patients a new resection and in 18 a simple colostomy. When the initial treatment was a Mile's operation (APR in 23 patients), it has been performed 10 new exerses and 5 electrocautery. In the whole series, mortality and morbidity were respectively 17.5 per cent and 8 per cent. After AR the long term survival was 40 months when the initial tumour was classified Dukes A, and only 12 months when it was classified Dukes B or C. After APR the median long term survival was only 12 months. 75 per cent of the recurrences are observed during the first two years after initial resection. The screening includes repeated clinical examination, CEA dosage, endorectal sonography, endoscopy and CT scan. The appreciation of extirpability requires clinical examination, CT scan, MRI imaging. The aim is 1. to avoid exploratory and/or palliative operations. 2. to appreciate operating difficulties and to choose an adequate approach.

The carcinoembryonic antigen (CAE) is the most sensitive marker for early detection of relapse. It can be combined with CA 19-9 assay, increasing the sensitivity and specificity of the tests. These assays are useful because one half of the relapsing tumours can be resected leading to a survival rate of 40%. CAE and CA 19-9 must be assayed within 2 months to 2 years after surgery to be effective screening tests. Presently, the widespread use of labelled monoclonal antibodies can, in certain tests, localize recurrent tumours before a second look operations."

On the other hand the highest value for carcino-embryonic antigen tests lies on the early detection of colonic cancer relapse. Ca 19-9 assay has a high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and a high predictive value in unresectable disease.

CD011134,0,7690348,0,Determination of the specificities of monoclonal antibodies recognizing members of the CEA family using a panel of transfectants.,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), one of the most clinically important tumor markers, is mainly used in the post-surgical surveillance of patients with colorectal carcinomas. CEA belongs to a large protein family, which includes cross-reacting antigens, e.g., non-specific cross-reacting antigens (NCAs) and biliary glycoprotein (BGP) as well as pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs). The genes encoding these proteins can be subdivided into the CEA and PSG subgroups. The members of the subgroups share antigenic determinants and show high similarity in amino-acid sequences. Their derived secondary structures show them to belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Due to the close relationship of the members of the CEA subgroup, it is very difficult to distinguish between the individual members with MAbs. Here we have used flow cytometric analysis of transfectants expressing individual members of the CEA subgroup as an alternative approach to determine the specificities of 13 MAbs. This allows us to examine the specificities of these antibodies for members of the CEA family, even of those which have not yet been characterized at the protein level. In addition, binding of the MAbs to NCAs expressed by polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) was tested by Western-blot analysis, immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry. Four antibodies bound exclusively to NCA-50/90 and one MAb (80H3) only to NCA-95. MAb 4/3/17 recognizes CEA and BGP on the surface of transfectants and NCA-160 from granulocytes. We assume that NCA-160 is a product of the BGP gene. On granulocytes, which do not express CEA, MAb 4/3/17 is specific for NCA-160 (BGP). Mutual inhibition of the MAbs binding to NCA-50/90 revealed 3 different epitope groups."
CD011134,0,7690061,0,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein, CA 19.9 and CA 125 in advanced colorectal cancer (ACC).","In 111 patients with ACC we studied CEA, FP, CA-125 and CA 19.9 during therapy and follow-up. Marker determination was performed every two months. CEA was elevated (> 5 ng/ml) in 82%, alpha FP (> 15 ng/ml) in 0%, CA-125 (> 38 U/ml) in 37%, CA 19.9 (> 30 U/ml) in 64% of the patients. We did not find significant differences between the sensitivity of CEA alone and that of the combination of CEA + CA-125 (86%), CEA + CA 19.9 (87%), CA-125 + CA-19.9 (71%) and CEA + CA-125 + CA 19.9 (88%). We did not find any correlation between the level of positivity of the markers and the clinical parameters we examined. When serial determinations were carried out, CEA showed the best indication of response to treatment, followed by CA 19.9. In the evaluation of the response to chemotherapy we found that CA 125 presented significant percentages of false-positive (9%) (P < 0.008) and false-negative (8.1%) (P < 0.008) results, compared to CEA and CA 19.9. CA 125 did not demonstrate any utility for the follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer although increased values were found in 37%. We conclude that CEA is currently the best marker for the follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer. The combination of CEA and CA 19.9 had some utility in follow-up, without significantly improving CEA results."

Mean follow-up period was 14 months (range 2-72 months). Mean number of serum specimens was 5 (range 2-9). IgA-1 assay employed rabbit antihuman IgA for binding IgA-1 from patient's serum and peanut agglutinin to detect the IgA-1 O-glycosidic structure. Ten patients developed distant metastases while nine patients had locoregional recurrence. All 19 patients had generally persistent elevation of serum IgA-1 throughout the follow-up period while serum CEA levels were subsequently elevated in only 10 patients. IgA-1 predicted recurrence with an average lead time of 8 months (range 1-19 months). On the other hand, mean lag time for CEA was 12 months (range 6-50 months). The data indicate the clinical utility of serum IgA-1 as a potential complementary tumour marker to CEA in the monitoring of the postoperative course of this particular subset of colorectal cancer patients."

CD011134,0,1733432,0,Time to loco-regional recurrence after resection of Dukes' B and C colorectal cancer with or without adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy. A multivariate regression analysis.,"Factors influencing time to loco-regional recurrence were identified in a multivariate regression analysis of data from a series of 468 radically operated patients (260 Dukes' B and 208 Dukes' C) with carcinoma of the rectum and the rectosigmoid. A number of clinical and pathological characteristics were prospectively collected and recorded. In addition, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was measured within 1 week before surgery. The endpoint used was recurrence below the level of the umbilicus. All patients were followed for at least 5 years or until time of death. The two Dukes' stages B and C were analysed in two separate analyses using the Cox proportional hazards model. In patients with Dukes' B tumours, an increased risk of loco-regional recurrence was associated with perineural invasion, tumour located less than 10 cm from the anal verge, patient aged above 70 years, and small tumour size. In patients with Dukes' C tumours, the necessity to resect neighbour organs, perineural and venous invasion, tumour located less than 10 cm from the anal verge, and large tumour size were all associated with a poor loco-regional outcome. Postoperative radiotherapy was not a significant prognosticator for loco-regional control. An update of the 5-year results of the randomised study of post-operative radiotherapy (50 Gy with 2 Gy per fraction in an overall treatment time of 7 weeks) showed no survival benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy in either Dukes' category and no statistically significant improvement in the 5-year loco-regional control rate. However, when the comparison was restricted to a group of high-risk patients there was a statistically significant benefit from radiotherapy with respect to loco-regional control (P = 0.03) but not with respect to survival (P = 0.23). The potential advantage, in terms of the required number of patients, of restricting clinical trials of intensified loco-regional therapies to the high-risk patients, is illustrated."

Fifteen patients were clinically and radiologically free of recurrences and asymptomatic while 10 had rising CEA and/or symptoms. We repeatedly imaged the patients following intravenous administrations of 40 mg ZCE 025, every 4 to 6 mo. Side effects occurred in 16% of patients who received two or more infusions. Sixteen lesions were detected by immunoscintigraphy in 11 patients who were free of disease by CT scans or other imaging modalities. Ten recurrences were surgically confirmed in seven patients. Radiographic and clinical follow-up confirmed the remaining 6 Mab-positive lesions. Elevated human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) titers were detectable in the sera of 30% and 64% of patients following the 1st and 2nd Mab injection respectively, but did not interfere with successful immunoscintigraphy nor correlated with the occurrence of side effects.

Surgical samples of 15 patients were individually homogenized and assayed by the same method and revealed that the arginase level in tissues with colorectal cancer was two times greater than the level found in normal mucosal tissues (1.74 +/- 0.31 micrograms/g tissue versus 0.77 +/- 0.09 micrograms/g tissue, P less than 0.005). However, the serum arginase levels in patients with colorectal cancer were independent of their carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (n = 27, arginase 11.81 +/- 1.88 ng/ml, CEA 17.31 +/- 4.24 ng/ml, r = 0.084, P = 0.666). The results suggested that serum arginase level can be a valuable criterion for preoperative evaluation and possibly postoperative follow-up study. It can also combine with CEA determination to intensify the clinical assessment for colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,1641613,0,[Reoperation in colorectal carcinoma with curative intention].,"From the surgical point of view it may be helpful to adopt the following guidelines in the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally recurrent colorectal cancer: 1. A gastroenterologist concerned with oncological patients should initiate adequate resectional treatment of the primary tumor. 2. In case of locoregional recurrences, every diagnostic effort (endoscopy, intraluminal ultrasound, angiogram, CT-scan, MRI) should be made to select patients with limited and resectable disease. 3. In patients with liver metastases amenable to surgical resection it is mandatory to rule out extrahepatic disease preoperatively as far as possible. 4. Prognostic factors deriving from tumor-biological data, extent of recurrent disease, and laboratory findings (CEA) must be taken into consideration when the decision whether to operate is to be made. These arguments should also be used to support non-operative treatment in patients with a type of recurrence that cannot be cured by surgery. 5. Postoperatively, all information (intraoperatively detected extrahepatic disease, tumor infiltrated resection margins, CEA not returning to normal levels) should be combined to classify patients according to whether they carry a high risk for a second tumor recurrence and should thus undergo additional treatment. In a ""low-risk situation"", further follow-up seems to be adequate."
CD011134,0,1638001,0,[The clinical relevance of anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy with the 99mTc-labelled monoclonal antibody BW 431/26. A critical assessment after 119 studies].,"The results of 119 radioimmunoscintigraphies (RIS) in 113 patients with the 99mTc-labeled monoclonal anti-CEA-antibody BW 431/26 (Behring) have been analysed. The aim of our study was the estimation of the method's sensitivity and specificity under different aspects to find out for which indications and questions the 99mTc-RIS is useful. Colorectal primary tumours in 19 patients were scintigraphically detected with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 100%; 3 out of 7 other tumour sites were localised correctly. 55 patients were examined during the follow-up of colorectal cancer. There were 17 out of 22 true positive findings of local recurrences (sensitivity 77%, specificity 88%). Liver metastases were imaged as hot lesions with only 41% sensitivity and 86% specificity. The detection of extrahepatic tumour sites is difficult because of the persistently high blood-pool activity of the monoclonal antibody and, in the pelvic area, the unspecific bowel activity. Skeletal metastases were recognised in 7 out of 9 cases. In 14 patients with other non-colorectal carcinomas, RIS was successful in single cases. It is not helpful, however, when searching for tumours of unknown origin or for the screening of patients with elevated CEA levels without tumour history. The high technical, methodological and time effort required by RIS is justified in the follow-up of cancer patients when conventional diagnostic procedures are inconclusive or the status of morphological findings remains unclear. The use of RIS as an unspecific screening tool in tumour diagnosis must be rejected because of the not completely explored risks of the examination. Repeated applications of monoclonal antibodies require controls of the patients' HAMA titers before performing RIS."

Carbohydrate antigen 19.9 was above the cut-off limit of 37 U/mL in 35% of patients. Carbohydrate antigen 19.9 sensitivity was related to tumor stage. Carcinoembryonic antigen was above the cut-off level of 3.5 ng/mL in 61% of patients, and the simultaneous use of two markers increased sensitivity to 66%. The main use of pretreatment levels of CA 19.9 in locoregional cancer is in prognosis. Carbohydrate antigen 19.9 provided more prognostic information than that obtained by conventional staging methods. In patients with Dukes' C tumors, additional information was obtained for allocation of these patients into groups at low or high risk of recurrence. Prognostic significance of carcinoembryonic antigen was not independent of Dukes' classification."

Eighteen patients of colorectal cancer with metastases to the liver or lung or of unresectable hepatoma received a 24 hour continuous infusion with low dose recombinant of IL-2 (mainly 8 x 10(5) JRU/day) for 25-40 days. All patients tolerated this protocol of the therapy and the main toxic effects were fever and general fatigue. Such serious toxicity as previously reported by high dose IL-2 therapy was not observed. Data of hepatic and renal functions were normal. IS-IL-2 therapy induced a high incidence of eosinophilia (12/18) and thrombocythemia (12/18). Peripheral natural killer (NK) and LAK activities were augmented in all patients and total white blood cell counts were increased during IS-IL-2 therapy. An increase in IL-2 receptor expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and significant rises in numbers of Leu11 (CD16)+, OKM1(CD11)+ and OKIa1(HLA-DR)+ were observed. Of 18 patients 12 were evaluable for their response to therapy. Partial response (PR) was observed in one unresectable hepatoma and 11 demonstrated no change (NC) or progressive disease (PD). Six patients were not evaluable because of additional therapy (3 cases) or decreasing tumor cell markers having no measurable lesions (3 cases). Three patients of colorectal cancer from an unresectable group were presumed to have micrometastases to the liver as suggested by an elevated serum CEA level. After receiving IS-IL-2 therapy they demonstrated a decrease in the serum CEA level for more than 3 years after treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD011134,0,1589986,0,Locally recurrent rectal cancer: surgical strategy.,"Relapses after ""curative resection"" of rectal cancer may be localized and thus amenable to surgical treatment. The risk of relapse may be higher than previously believed depending on adequacy and length of follow-up, the diagnostic modalities used, and the number of autopsies performed. Technical refinements such as a distal margin greater than 2 cm, radical pelvic lymphadenectomy, and high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery at the aorta do not appear to diminish the risk of recurrence. A wider lateral margin and a more complete excision of the mesorectum may be beneficial, but this is yet unproven. Surgery for isolated, locally recurrent lesions should be limited to carefully selected patients and performed in tertiary centers using a team approach. Whether such radical ""salvage"" procedures are justifiable merits further careful evaluation."
CD011134,0,1589179,0,Radioimmunoscintigraphy of colorectal carcinoma with a 99Tcm-labelled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (BW 431/26).,"Radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) with BW 431/26 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) labelled with 99Tcm (962 MBq) has been performed in 64 patients with colorectal carcinoma, one of them with two independent tumours. The group consisted of 46 primary lesions, 15 pelvic recurrences and four suspected recurrences which were shown to be liver metastases. Imaging of liver was obtained in all patients, but surgical liver examination was performed in only 56 of them. Planar scans were obtained at 4 and 24 h postinjection. Tomographic images were also performed in five patients. The final diagnosis was confirmed in all patients by their clinical course and by findings at surgery and pathology. A comparative study between the RIS results and the final diagnosis gave a global sensitivity in primary tumours and pelvic recurrences of 59.7% with an accuracy of 59.0%. When rectal tumours were excluded, the results were 81.1 and 84.9%, respectively. In liver metastases the sensitivity was 50%, with an accuracy of 85.7% and a specificity of 100%. No correlation has been found between CEA serum levels and lesion detection. In conclusion, RIS is a useful technique for the study and localization of colorectal tumours, being also indicated in patients with normal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels and clinical suspicion of illness."
CD011134,0,1586298,0,Regression of liver metastases following treatment with yttrium-90 microspheres.,"Selective internal radiation (SIR) therapy is a technique developed by our group for concentration of Yttrium-90 microspheres into liver metastases. The technique involves laparotomy, insertion of the catheter into the hepatic artery, redistribution of liver blood flow with vaso-active agents and incremental embolization of Yttrium-90 containing microspheres (SIR spheres) into the liver. Twenty-nine patients with non-resectable liver metastases from primary adenocarcinoma of the large bowel were treated by this technique and followed for a minimum of three months to assess evidence of tumour regression. Response to treatment was measured by serial estimations of carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) and tumour volumes measured from serial computerized tomography (CT) scanning of the liver. There was a fall in the serum CEA level in all 26 patients in whom the serial estimations of CEA were performed following SIR therapy. The overall mean fall in CEA was 70% of pre-treatment levels with 88% of patients (23 of 26) experiencing more than a 50% fall in pre-treatment CEA levels. In 18 of 22 evaluable patients CT measured tumour volumes decreased following SIR therapy. In 48% of patients (10 of 22 patients) the decrease in tumour volume was more than 50%. SIR therapy results in a high rate of tumour regression in patients with liver metastases secondary to large bowel cancer."

The sensitivity of 111In-CYT-103 imaging was slightly lower when interpreted retrospectively by the blinded readers in the absence of any patient-specific information. 111In-CYT-103 imaging sensitivity was similar in patients with primary and recurrent disease, but lower for liver metastases than for extrahepatic disease. Thirty-three previously unknown lesions were visualized by immunoscintigraphy; tissue confirmation was available for only five lesions, and all were found to be free of tumor. Only one of the lesions evaluated was TAG-72 positive. Twenty-eight lesions were outside the surgical field or not biopsied. Although no tissue confirmation was available, seven (25%) of these lesions were identified as consistent with metastatic disease by other conventional modalities. Importantly, antibody scans detected occult tumor lesions in 11 of the 92 patients with surgically confirmed adenocarcinoma, and accurately diagnosed 7 of 10 patients with elevated serum CEA levels and negative conventional workup. Surgery confirmed the presence of tumor identified only by 111In-CYT-103 in three patients, while four patients with negative scans had no evidence of recurrent disease at surgery. Antibody scans confirmed the absence of additional disease in 18 of 22 patients with isolated hepatic or pelvic recurrences in whom curative surgery was contemplated. The results of this multicenter trial suggest that CYT-103 immunoscintigraphy can provide information that is complementary to that derived from standard diagnostic techniques. During the workup of patients with primary colorectal carcinoma, this modality assesses the entire body and allows for the identification of multiple lesions at various locations simultaneously. It can then redirect attention and further workup to those areas not originally surveyed. Of special interest in this regard is the identification of occult lesions in five patients with primary colorectal cancer. 111In-CYT-103 imaging was found superior to CT in the localization of primary colorectal cancer, but neither modality could adequately assess the extent of tumor penetration through the bowel wall (the T stage in the TNM system) or the N status. The limitations of CT in evaluating T and N are well documented, and the limitations of 111In-based immunoscintigraphy for these same lesions have recently been described. Another limitation of 111In-CYT-103 immunoscintigraphy is in the identification of liver metastases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD011134,0,1575626,0,Technical and biological factors in disease-free survival after hepatic resection for colorectal cancer metastases.,"Careful patient selection for hepatic resection of colorectal cancer metastases is essential to improve current poor results. Carcinoembryonic antigen level and number of metastases were significant preoperative prognostic indicators of 5-year disease-free survival in patients selected clinically for hepatic surgery. Surgical margin, weight of hepatic tissue resected, carcinoembryonic antigen level, and flow cytometry were significant postoperative prognostic indicators. Patients with a carcinoembryonic antigen level less than 200 ng/mL, 1-cm surgical margins, and less than 1,000 g of liver tissue removed had a greater than 50% estimated 5-year disease-free survival rate. If the metastases were diploid on flow cytometry, an additional survival advantage may have been gained. Inadequate surgical margins led to high rates of liver-only recurrence. Nonhepatic recurrence was unrelated to surgical margins. Intraoperative liver examination by ultrasound during primary colon cancer resection and adjuvant chemotherapy may offer earlier selection of biologically appropriate patients and improved outcome; both recommendations require clinical trials."
CD011134,0,1574769,0,"Therapy monitoring of presacral recurrences after high-dose irradiation: value of PET, CT, CEA and pain score.","21 patients were followed by positron-emission-tomography (PET) FDG (18Flourdeoxyglucose) uptake, physical examination, CT and CEA levels after combined photon-neutron irradiation for inoperable recurrent rectal carcinoma. In order to evaluate the response to radiotherapy symptomatic relief, CEA levels, decrease of tumor volume measured by CT analysis were correlated with the FDG-uptake. The objective of this study was also to investigate if the level of FDG-uptake prior to radiotherapy or the early decrease after therapy can be used as a prognostic factor. Prior to radiotherapy sacral pain was the predominant symptom. All malignancies showed measurable tumor masses, evaluation of CEA levels and enhanced tracer accumulation of FDG in the PET cross section. The mean FDG-uptake before radiotherapy was 2.3 +/- 1.1 (range 1.1 to 5.0) in 21 patients in contrast to 1.9 +/- 0.7 (range 0.8 bis 4.0) three months after radiotherapy. In six patients FDG concentration values decreased to the range of normal soft tissue, moreover, two of them relapsed after six and 22 months. Elevated FDG-uptake of the sacral bone was noted in PET cross sections in two patients, while there was no evidence of osseous alterations in CT. Normal levels of CEA were achieved in 14 patients and complete or partial pain relief in 20 of 21 patients. A decrease of tumor volume of more than 50% was detected in the follow-up CT scans of three patients but no complete remission was found. The result suggests that enhanced glucose uptake is associated with recurrent rectal cancer. However, enhanced glycolytic activity is related not only to malignant cells but also to all proliferating cells. To distinguish between proliferation, repair, inflammation, and residual viable tumor cells is not possible and may be responsible for an unchanged or elevated FDG-uptake after radiotherapy."

The combination helps in localizing abnormal monoclonal uptake and in differentiating it from a physiological radioactivity distribution. The so-called rendered images (RIs) are obtained in both IS and BL studies according to a depth- weighted maximum activity projection algorithm. Fused BL and IS RIs are constructed by a simple, pixel by pixel addition. They are displayed using a bicolour grey-red scale, which makes it possible to visualize both studies by a transparency effect.

IS was performed with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-specific indium-111 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) in 5 patients with colorectal cancer, and with OC125 111In-MoAbs in 5 patients with ovarian cancer. All patients had an abnormal CT image result in the pelvis, which was interpreted 5 times as recurrence, once as doubtful and four times as scar fibrosis. Recurrence was subsequently proven in all patients. Bone scintigraphy (BS) SPET was recorded at the same time as IS. No special technique was used during BS, IS or CT acquisition. CT images were fed into a computer using a CCD camera. Using the internal anatomical landmarks provided by the pelvic bone structures seen on CT and BS, an operator had to select corresponding fiducial points, which were used by the software to register the images. The final results were CT-BS and CT-IS superimposed images. CT-BS images were used for quality control. In all patients, the inspection of CT-BS and CT-IS showed that the registration process is accurate and assists in the co-interpretation of CT and IS images."

Median interval between colon resection and lung resection was 34 months. Ninety-eight patients (70.5%) had a solitary metastasis. Wedge excision was performed in 68 patients, lobectomy in 53, lobectomy plus wedge excision in 9, bilobectomy in 4, and pneumonectomy in 5. Operative mortality was 1.4%. Localized extrapulmonary colorectal cancer was also resected in 20 patients. Median follow-up was 7 years (range 1 to 20.4 years). Overall 5- and 20-year survival was 30.5% and 16.2%, respectively. Five-year survival for patients with solitary metastasis was 36.9%, as compared with 19.3% for those with two metastases (p less than 0.05) and 7.7% for those with more than two (p less than 0.01). Patients with normal carcino-embryonic antigen had a 5-year survival of 46.8% versus 16.0% for patients with increased levels (p less than 0.01). Five-year survival for patients with resected extrapulmonary disease was 30.0% versus 30.7% for those without extrapulmonary cancer (p = not significant). Repeat thoracotomy for recurrent metastases was done in 19 patients. Five-year survival after the second lung resection was 30.2%. We conclude that resection of colorectal lung metastases is safe and effective, that resectable extrapulmonary disease does not necessarily contraindicate pulmonary resection, and that repeat thoracotomy is warranted in selected patients with recurrent colorectal lung metastases."

CD011134,0,1568399,1,"Role of CEA, TPA, and Ca 19-9 in the early detection of localized and diffuse recurrent rectal cancer.","Sixty-six consecutive patients who underwent curative resection for rectal cancer were studied prospectively to evaluate the roles of sequential carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), and carcinomatous antigen 19-9 (Ca 19-9) determinations in the early diagnosis of resectable recurrences. Thirty-three recurrences were detected between 6 and 42 months. CEA, TPA, and Ca 19-9 showed a sensitivity of 72.7 percent, 78.8 percent, and 60.1 percent, respectively, and a specificity of 60.6 percent, 60.6 percent, and 87.9 percent, respectively. In 23 cases the rise in the value of CEA and/or TPA and/or Ca 19-9 was the first sign of recurrences, and the diagnosis was established later by clinical methods. In this group, the lead time was two months for liver metastases and four months for disseminated metastases. As far as the relationship between localization of recurrence and marker level increase is concerned, of 16 hepatic metastases CEA, TPA, and Ca 19-9 showed a sensitivity of 94 percent (P less than 0.05), 69 percent, and 62 percent, respectively. Of six patients with local recurrences, CEA, TPA, and Ca 19-9 showed a sensitivity of 50 percent, 100 percent (P less than 0.05), and 83.3 percent, respectively. Of three patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis, CEA, TPA (P less than 0.05), and Ca 19-9 showed a sensitivity of 0 percent, 100 percent, and 0 percent, respectively. No significant differences were reported among the three markers according to multiple metastases and metachronous polyps. Fourteen patients (42.4 percent) underwent surgical treatment for recurrent disease, and eight of them (57 percent) showed a resectable disease, for a total resectability rate of 24.2 percent. The findings of our study indicate that a follow-up program based on CEA, TPA, and Ca 19-9 assays is related to an early diagnosis and a good resectability rate for both local and metastatic recurrences from rectal cancer."

Recognition of the location of nodes in the mesocolic, left colic, and IMA nodal groups can help in developing a systematic approach to the detection of nodal metastasis. This can be especially important in preoperative planning for cases in which resection may be curative. In addition, an understanding of the distribution of nodal metastasis will make it possible to recognize early recurrent nodal disease, particularly with an increase in associated increase in levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, and to predict certain clinical sequences such as hydronephrosis of the left kidney associated with left colic nodal metastases."

CD011134,0,1511391,0,Colorectal cancer. Principles of postoperative follow-up.,"Monitoring patients after primary large bowel surgery for malignancy is predicated on the concept that early detection of recurrence may provide salvage treatment for cure. Knowledge of the pathologic site and stage provides important information as to the probability of recurrence and the patterns of failure that are likely to occur. Available methods to detect recurrence include clinical, roentgenographic, and serum tests that are done more frequently during the first 2 years after surgery. Monitoring plasma carcinoembryonic antigen levels can lead to identification of asymptomatic recurrences, but there is controversy about the curability of recurrences outside the liver. Newer techniques (such as computed tomographic portography, intraoperative ultrasonography, and radioimmunoguided surgery) provide greater diagnostic accuracy and lead to more appropriate procedures during ""second-look"" operations. For example, hepatic resection in properly selected patients offers up to a 30% chance of cure and should be pursued aggressively. A search for metachronous cancers by endoscopy also should be done. Knowledge of the potential and patterns of failure can provide a useful guide during the postoperative follow-up care of the patient with large bowel cancer."

Biopsy was performed in the following sites: liver (n = 34), retroperitoneum (n = 8), adrenal gland (n = 3), pancreas (n = 2), omentum (n = 2), pelvis (n = 2), spleen (n = 2), and stomach (n = 1). Histologic findings proved malignancy in 39 patients and benign disease in 11 patients. In these 11 patients, the mean levels of tissue CEA were lower than the normal level of serum CEA (3 ng/mL). Tissue CEA levels were higher than serum CEA levels in nine patients with colonic carcinoma and in 12 of 16 patients with noncolonic CEA-secreting malignancies. Four patients with noncolonic CEA-secreting malignancies had tissue CEA levels within the normal range (less than 3 ng/mL). Tissue CEA levels were also normal in 13 patients with various non-CEA-secreting tumors. Tissue CEA levels may prove useful in biopsy of necrotic or cystic lesions and assessment of response to ablative therapy for colon metastases."

The positivity rate was high for all four markers in stage V cases among 86 cases of colorectal cancer, and in cases of non resectable cancer and cases of recurrence. The highest positive rate was obtained with CEA. On the contrary, in cases of stage I to IV the positivity rates of these four tumor markers were as low as 0 to 34.8%. Out of 127 cases of colorectal cancer excluded of 43 NED cases, 52 cases were negative for all four tumor markers and 14 cases were positive only for CEA. In 49 cases, CEA and at least one of the other three tumor markers gave positive results. In 12 cases, CEA gave negative results and at least one of the other three tumor markers positive results. In conclusion, measurement of blood levels of these tumor markers is limited of its usefulness in early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, in the diagnosis of advanced stage and of recurrence during the postoperative follow-up period the measurement of tumor markers provides useful information. CEA is most sensitive among the four tumor markers tested and any combination of these four markers is not advantageous because of an increase in false positivity rate."

There was however, no significant difference in tumor recurrence time between the groups treated with RIT alone or with RIT + 5FU. Myelotoxicity, the major side effect of RIT, detected by the decrease of peripheral white blood cells (WBC), was shown to be almost identical between the groups receiving only RIT or only 5FU. Surprisingly, there was no cumulative bone marrow toxicity in animals which received 5FU before RIT. Furthermore, in the latter group, the WBC levels after RIT were significantly higher than in the control group receiving only RIT. Taken together, the results demonstrate the higher therapeutic efficiency of RIT as compared to 5FU in this model. They do not show, however, that the combination of the two forms of treatment can induce longer tumor remission. Interestingly, the WBC results suggest that 5FU given before RIT can have a radioprotective effect on bone marrow, possibly by selecting radioresistant bone marrow stem cells."

CD011134,0,1486919,0,Serum values of CA72.4 in patients with gastrointestinal system tumors comparison with CEA and CA 19.9.,"Serum CA 72.4 levels of patients with malignant gastrointestinal disorders (n = 77) were determined in parallel with the CEA and CA 19.9 levels. The values related to healthy individuals were 1.7 U/ml, with a median of 1.7 U/ml, whereas an average of 12.1 U/l (median 2 U/ml) was measured in malignancy. Among all three markers CEA showed the highest positive rate while the values for CA 19.9 and CA 72.4 were lower. Although positive rates among the healthy group were observed with CEA and CA 19.9, no false positives were found with CA 72.4. Elevated CA 72.4 levels were found in 17.6% of patients with gastric carcinoma and 56.3% with colorectal carcinoma. All markers showed significant sensitivity for the malignant state when used alone. However, the regression analysis revealed that only the combination of CA 72.4 and CEA may contribute significantly to the diagnostic potential. Our results indicate that complementation of CEA with CA 72.4 can significantly increase the sensitivity in the serodiagnosis of gastrointestinal system cancers. Combination of positive information from these two sources is likely to lead to a more accurate diagnosis and may therefore improve the efficiency of the follow-up and therapeutic response."

Mutual interference between the high energy radiotherapy system (Toshiba LMR-15A) and the 13.56 MHz capacitive heating system (Omron HEH-500C) was tested with phantom materials prior to a clinical trial with SRH. The energy and flatness of irradiation were not affected by the heating system within the range of clinical use. The high energy radiotherapy system did not affect the increase or distribution of temperature during simultaneous treatment. The results of this phantom study indicated that these apparatuses would not produce clinically significant mutual interference during SRH. A clinical trial was performed on a 57-year-old woman with postoperative recurrence of rectal cancer. This is the first reported clinical case treated with true SRH in which external irradiation was administered during mid capacitive heating. Twelve SRH treatments were performed on the recurrent lesion at a frequency of twice a week for six weeks using the apparatuses described above. There was a significant reduction in pain after treatment. The tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level decreased after treatment. On CT images taken after treatment, the tumor site became a low density area which indicated necrosis. There were no side effects. These results suggest that further clinical study of SRH should be performed to clarify its advantages."

Results of a nation-wide German survey].,"To obtain appropriate information about the present use of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) in diagnosis and follow-up of gastrointestinal carcinomas, an inquiry into 102 German university and non-university hospitals was performed. 97 answers to ten standardized questions were available for evaluation. TAA are generally used in gastrointestinal carcinomas by 98.5% and 92.6% of internists (i) and surgeons (s), respectively. Preoperatively, serum concentrations of TAA are determined in 63.9% (i) and 84% (s) of gastric carcinomas. The corresponding rates in colorectal carcinomas are 93.8% and 92.6%. TAA are a routine part of postoperative care in 68.8% (i) and 76% (s) of gastric and in 100% (i) and 96.2% (s) of colorectal cancers. Interest is almost exclusively focused on CEA and CA 19-9. Other tumor associated antigens are rarely investigated in these diseases. Increasing serum concentrations of TAA induce intensive diagnostic procedures in 82.4% and 95.7% of internists and surgeons. However, an indication for a second-look operation solely based on increasing TAA concentrations is only seen by 30.6% of internists and 37% of surgeons. In gastric cancer the course of TAA concentrations is used for determining the effects of chemo- or radiotherapy in 36.4% (i) and 71.4% (s). The corresponding rates for colorectal carcinomas vary between 66.6% (i) and 80% (s). The results of this nation-wide inquiry confirm the wide use of CEA and CA 19-9 in gastrointestinal carcinomas. There are obvious differences with respect to diagnostic or therapeutic consequences based on postoperatively increasing serum levels of TAA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011134,0,1466082,0,Reversal of resistance to doxifluridine and fluorouracil in metastatic colorectal cancer: the role of high-dose folinic acid.,"The benefits from medical treatment in colorectal cancer are limited. Fluorouracil remains the only recognized drug, and how to treat unresponsive patients is still debated. To evaluate the role of folinic acid (FA) in circumvence resistance in colorectal cancer, 28 patients pretreated with fluoropyrimidine were candidated to receive one of the following schedules: fluorouracil (600 mg/m2) associated with FA (500 mg/m2) weekly for 6 weeks (Regimen A: 21 cases), or fluorouracil (370 mg/m2) plus FA (200 mg/m2) daily for 5 days every 4 weeks (Regimen B: 7 cases). Fourteen patients were pretreated with doxifluridine, a new fluoropyrimidine derivative with a peculiar mechanism of action, and the remaining 14 patients with fluorouracil. All but 2 patients were unresponsive to first-line treatments. When the treatment began, the median age of the patients was 60 years (range, 30-68). The performance status (ECOG) was 0/1 in 25 of them, and the primary tumor was in the colon and rectum in 19 and 9 patients, respectively. Sites of disease were liver (64%), lung (35%), local recurrence (10%) and peritoneum (10%). A median of 3 cycles (range, 1-7) was delivered, and no objective response was observed in the group of patients pretreated with doxifluridine or in the group pretreated with fluorouracil. In 5 cases a significant decrease in baseline CEA values was observed. Therapy was well tolerated, and no grade 4 toxicity was encountered. Severe toxicity was limited and included diarrhea (7 patients), stomatitis (1 patient) and nausea/vomiting (1 patient). High-dose FA has no role in reversing resistance to fluoropyrimidine, and other mechanisms of refractoriness are surely involved. FA should be associated with fluoropyrimidine as first-line therapy together with other biochemical modulators. Further rescue therapies need to be developed."

Fifteen (60%) patients showed a rise in serum CEA levels above 5 ng/ml. Planar scans and emission computed tomographic (ECT) imaging were carried out without reference to the results of computed tomographic (CT) scans and gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations done 1-2 weeks before IS. Final diagnoses were based on biopsies and autopsies (13 cases) or on follow-up findings over at least 2 years (12 cases). Sixteen patients had a final diagnosis of recurrent malignant disease in the extrahepatic abdomen or pelvis. Of these, six were correctly diagnosed by both IS and conventional diagnostic procedures, six by IS only and two by conventional methods only. Two tumour recurrences remained undetected by both diagnostic approaches. However, five tumour recurrences were detected by IS more than 4 months earlier than by any other diagnostic procedures performed during clinical follow-up. Of the nine disease-free patients (disregarding the liver) three were correctly identified by both IS and the other diagnostic methods, four by IS only and two by conventional diagnostic procedures only. Overall sensitivity (75%) and specificity (89%) of 111In-IS were higher than figures obtained using CT scanning and endoscopy (50% and 78% respectively).

CD011134,0,1431347,0,Application of genetically-engineered anti-CEA antibodies for potential immunotherapy of colorectal cancer.,"Hitherto anti-CEA monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), normally of mouse origin, have been used primarily for clinical diagnosis of colorectal cancer, either as a tumor marker in serum to monitor tumor recurrence, or latterly as a means to localize in vivo CEA-bearing tumors, and metastases in patients. In vivo diagnosis using mouse anti-CEA MAbs has so far had limited clinical utility because the antibodies elicit a strong anti-mouse immunoglobulin immune response on repeated administration in man. This problem has been addressed by the development of various strategies for ""humanization"" of mouse anti-CEA MAbs by genetic manipulation of immunoglobulin genes. Such humanized, engineered antibodies markedly attenuate the antigenic response directed against the MAb, such that safe, repeated administration to patients has become feasible. Such humanized anti-CEA antibodies can thus be radioactively-labelled and applied for in vivo monitoring and detection of recurrent malignant disease, or used for therapeutic strategies which similarly take advantage of the ability of the antibodies to target cytotoxic agents selectively to tumor cells. The application of these novel procedures for manipulating MAb structure presents entirely new opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of human colorectal cancer."

This article reviews our experience with radioimmunoscintigraphy in 59 patients with colorectal cancer in follow-up, using 131I and 111In labeled B72.3, and in 16 patients with primary gastrointestinal tumors using 99mTc anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (type F023C5). The sensitivity of both B72.3 and anti-CEA was greater than 70% either for primary tumors and abdominal recurrences or distant metastases except hepatic ones. A significant gradient in antibody uptake was measured on surgical biopsies between tumors and normal tissues allowing a good in vivo contrast for gamma detection. We have defined the impact of some factors affecting in vivo tumor targeting. In fact, pharmacodynamics of MAbs, percentage of injected dose bound to tissues were measured, and in particular antigenic content in tumor nodules was quantified. Furthermore, the results of RIS were compared to those obtained by CT and other imaging modalities."

In this paper the experience of the Istituto Tumori of Milan is reviewed and the results are discussed. Three hundred and thirty-six patients were followed after curative resection of colorectal carcinoma. The follow-up period was 15 years, from January 1975 to December 1990 (global follow-up 1358 years). In the course of follow-up 136 patients developed recurrent disease. The number of CEA determinations for each patient ranged from 1 to 37 (mean 8, total 3330). CEA levels of presurgical patients were related to the clinical stage. Among patients who developed recurrences 61% showed an increase in CEA serum levels. In 200 patients with a negative follow-up we observed only 15 cases of false-positive results."
CD011134,0,1430441,0,CT findings after hepatic chemoembolization.,"Hepatic arterial chemoembolization (CE) with a mixture of particulate collagen and chemotherapeutic agents was evaluated as therapy for hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma. This article describes the characteristics sequential pattern of change seen on liver CT scans following CE. Thirty CT scans were performed on seven patients who had undergone a total of 11 CE procedures. All patients had baseline, immediate postprocedural, and follow-up CT exams at 1 to 2 month intervals following CE. Immediate post-procedural CT scans mapped the area of embolization owing to the density of the contrast mixed with the CE agents. Some lesions seen easily on baseline were more difficult to see as they became isodense with normal liver. Reflux of embolic material into the cystic artery and gallbladder wall was also observed on postprocedural scans in three patients. In all patients, early follow-up scans (1 month after CE) demonstrated changes in lesions seen on baseline scans consistent with tumor necrosis. This was corroborated by a decrease in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. In three patients, however, low attenuation regions developed in areas in which there had been no lesion before. The significance of these is uncertain, but the low CEA values and the subsequent evolution in appearance of these sites on CT suggest that they were regions of hepatic ischemia/infarction as opposed to heretofore unidentifiable metastases, now ""unmasked."" Intermediate follow-up scans (2-3 months) revealed maximal effect on tumor volume, with a decrease of > or = 25% in five of seven patients (71%). Late follow-up scans (> or = 3 months after the last CE) confirmed recurrent disease and new lesions in all cases."

The markers were correlated with disease stage, histological grade and progression/remission of disease. The circulating preoperative median PRL and CEA levels were significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients than in their respective controls. PRL was elevated in all Dukes stages and in all histological grades of the tumour whereas the rise in CEA was more pronounced in Dukes D. Out of 74 patients, 29% (21/74) developed recurrent disease and 31% (23/74) responded to the treatment. With regard to monitoring recurrence(s), the predictive value of PRL was 94% which was significantly greater than that of CEA which was only 62%. In patients who developed liver metastases PRL remained elevated whereas CEA showed more than 100-fold increase. Therefore, we feel that CEA is a better marker for monitoring patients who developed liver metastases. From our results, we suggest that PRL can be used as a better overall marker for detecting recurrence(s) in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma."

We report a sharp decline of CEA in a patient with recurrent gastric cancer by 6 months oral administration of UFT. The patient was an 81-year-old male who had undergone gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer. Eight months post-operatively, the plasma CEA began to rise logarithmically, and recurrent tumor in the remnant stomach and liver metastasis were detected by fibergastroscope (FGS) and abdominal CT. After administration of UFT at a dose of 300 mg per day, CEA abruptly declined logarithmically and normalized in 6 months. Presently marked reduction of recurrent foci and metastases were found by FGS and abdominal CT. Therefore sequential changes in plasma CEA in this patient can be considered to reflect the effect of therapy for recurrent gastric cancer by UFT."

Preoperative serum concentrations of the four markers were determined in 198 colorectal cancer patients and 57 patients with a benign colorectal disorder. The cumulative frequency distributions of the malignant and benign group show strong overlap for all markers, which indicates low diagnostic ability. This is confirmed by the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, which have areas under the curve of 0.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-0.73) for CA 19-9, CA 50 and CA 195 and of 0.70 (95%) CI 0.63-0.77) for CEA. The new tumour markers appear to be of slightly less diagnostic value than CEA for the primary diagnosis of colorectal cancer, although the discrepancy is not statistically significant. The low diagnostic power of CA 19-9, CA 50 and CA 195 may be due to a high proportion of colorectal cancer patients having the Lewis(a-b-) phenotype, who cannot synthesise these markers."

In our series, the total operative mortality rate was 1.7% and the resectability rate was 88.1%. For these cases who received curative resection, the overall 5-year survival rate was 62.6%. The 5-year survival rate varied according to the Dukes' stage: stage A, 96.4%; stage B, 73.3% and stage C, 39.6%. The total recurrence rate after curative resection was 35.9%, including local recurrence 18.3%, systemic recurrence 12.0%, and combined recurrence 5.6%. According to Dukes' staging system, the recurrence rate for stage A, B and C were 0%, 22.4% and 63.8%, respectively. We used Cox's regression model to analyse the patients characteristics and pathological variables on recurrence and to assess the independent influence of each when all other factors were held constant. The pathological stage of the cancer had the strongest association. Other variables found to have an independent yet significant importance, were CEA level and tumor size. The identification of the patient group, at a high risk of recurrence, might promote a more judicious selection for surgical procedure and trials of adjuvant therapy."

In cases of nonresectable tumors, the positive rate was 66.7%, 66.7% and 83.33%, respectively. There was no definite correlation between the value of CA-19-9 and CEA. The data showed significantly higher sensitivity in combined assay than in either CA-19-9 or CEA alone. Combined assay with the sensitivity of 86.36% and the specificity of 88.79%, was more useful in finding of postoperative. recurrences or metastases.

Only 16% of colonic cancers and 39% of rectal cancers were biopsied pre-operatively and colonoscopy was undertaken in one-half and one-third respectively. Of the 737 responses, 555 patients were considered to have had curative surgery, and details of their follow-up during the four 6-month periods following surgery was analysed; this includes the effect of tumour stage and surgeon activity on the use and frequency of each test. Most patients had a clinical examination in each of the 6 month periods, but almost half did not have a colonoscopy and two-thirds did not have the serum CEA level measured at all. Only one in eight had a chest X-ray and fewer had the liver scanned during this 2 year period. Eighty-two patients (20% of those satisfactorily followed) suffered a recurrence during this period. Twenty-six were asymptomatic at the time of recurrence and were diagnosed by a routine test and of these, eight were diagnosed by tests used infrequently.

CD011134,0,1315472,0,[Significance of CEA and CA 19-9 for after care of curatively resected colorectal cancers].,The monitoring of CEA is valuable in the follow-up after curative resection of colorectal cancer and contributes to the early detection of local recurrence and distant metastases. The simultaneous detection of the CA 19-9 does not lead to a substantial advantage. The recurrences and especially the metastases detected by the monitoring of the tumour markers frequently are unresectable. In patients with elevated tumour markers without other evidences of recurrence or metastases the indication for a second-look operation should be considered cautious because elevated tumour markers are found in patients with benign diseases also.

Although carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate 19-9 antigen (CA 19-9) have been used widely as markers for the efficacy of therapy or detection of recurrent colorectal carcinomas in adults, no studies evaluating their efficacy in children and adolescents have been performed. Between 1986 and 1989, serial measurements of serum CEA and CA 19-9 levels were obtained from 11 patients (aged 8 to 18 years) treated at the institution of the authors. In contrast to the experience in adults, most (9 of 11) of the tumors were localized in the right or transverse colon. Histologically, 10 of 11 carcinomas were mucinous. Most patients had either Dukes' C (5 of 11) or D (5 of 11) lesions. After surgery, all patients were treated with a combination of 5-fluorouracil with Leucovorin (Lederle Laboratories, Pearl River, NY). With the use of the adult normal standards (CEA less than 3.0 ng/ml and CA 19-9 less than 37 ng/ml)6 for the patients, the specificity and sensitivity of CEA were 77% and 64%, respectively, whereas the specificity of CA 19-9 was 79% and the sensitivity was significantly low (10%). The combined specificity of the two markers was 71%, and the combined sensitivity was 60%. On the basis of these results, the authors believe that CEA and CA 19-9 are not effective markers for detection of recurrent or progressive colorectal carcinomas in children and adolescents."
CD011134,0,1281552,0,Tumor markers.,"The past decade has seen many advances in the detection, characterization, and clinical applications of tumor markers. Although cancer screening applications have been limited by low disease prevalences in asymptomatic populations, tumor markers may be of diagnostic value in specific situations. The major use of tumor markers in primary care is in monitoring disease recurrence and the response to therapy. These uses may obviate the need for second-look surgery as it has with CA 125 elevations in ovarian carcinoma. On the other hand, tumor markers may indicate a need for second-look surgery as when CEA levels are elevated in colorectal carcinoma. Despite the apparent usefulness of markers in detecting cancer recurrence, the clinician is reminded of the conditions justifying treatment with the discovery of an abnormal laboratory value as put forth by Fries and Holman: (1) the treatment should be known to be effective, (2) early treatment should be known to be more effective than therapy given after the disease is clinically apparent (or early treatment carry the risk of less toxicity), and (3) prediction of impending deterioration must be consistently accurate. When these criteria are met, the planning of therapeutic regimens on the basis of marker levels may be rationally considered. Until these criteria are met, elevated markers can only stimulate the clinician to be more vigilant in the search for response to therapy or recurrence. Exciting developments are on the horizon with respect to the use of tumor markers in radionuclide imaging, radioimmunoguided surgery, and development of drug delivery systems. Further research into the structure and function of these substances may provide further insights into the phenomena of malignant transformation, tumor invasion, metastasis, and the development of new therapeutic options. With new advances in molecular biology and with the identification of oncogenes, it may be possible in the future to detect mutant oncoproteins that are specific for early cancers and premalignant conditions. Delecting these oncoproteins may provide a basis for development of truly sensitive and specific markers that can be used to detect cancer at an early and curable stage."
CD011134,0,2068452,0,Second-look surgery for recurrent colorectal carcinoma: is it worthwhile?,"Second-look surgery for recurrent colorectal carcinoma has been advocated for over four decades. Routine follow-up procedures gave way to clinically directed or carcinoembryonic (CEA)-directed procedures in the mid-1970's. In this paper, we review the results of second-look surgery for recurrent colorectal carcinoma and ask the question, ""Is it worthwhile?"" Excluding surgery for symptomatic patients, we conclude that second-look surgery should only be performed for recurrent colorectal carcinoma with the intent of rendering the patient disease-free. Without effective systemic therapy, ""palliative"" or ""debulking"" procedures probably do not increase survival. The most likely candidates for such a curative approach with second-look surgery are those with isolated liver, pulmonary, and, less frequently, regional recurrences."
CD011134,0,2068450,0,CEA in tumors of other than colorectal origin.,"Carcinoembryonic antigen has been demonstrated to be a valuable clinical aid in the management of patients with colorectal carcinoma. Its elevation in the serum prior to evidence of clinical recurrence in up to 80% of patients highlights its utility. CEA has also been found to be elevated in the serum of patients with other epithelial malignancies, but these have not been as well studied as has colorectal carcinoma. In patients with breast cancer CEA elevations may be found in 40-73% of patients presenting with disease in stages I-IV. In addition, 80% of patients will have a CEA elevation 3-10 months prior to clinical symptoms of recurrence. Seventy-seven percent of patients with bronchogenic lung cancer will have an elevated preoperative value. However, cigarette smoking also causes an increase in the CEA assay level and, thus, differentiation between benign and malignant conditions is more difficult. In small cell carcinoma of the lung, CEA assay levels above 10 ng/ml correlate highly with metastatic disease, while values less than 2.5 ng/ml correlate with localized disease. Pancreatic and gastric malignancies demonstrate CEA level elevations in just over 50% of cases. But these, however, have not been clinically useful. Epithelial neoplasms of the female reproductive tract (cervix, uterus, and ovary) also produce CEA in 47-75% of cases and may correlate with stage of disease at diagnosis and level of cellular differentiation. CEA assay levels are elevated in a variety of tumors and correlate with tumor stage, degree of differentiation, and effectiveness of therapy; they may also be the earliest marker of recurrence."
CD011134,0,2068448,0,Multiple operations for recurrent colorectal cancer.,"The benefit of an aggressive surgical approach in selective patients with recurrent colorectal cancer has been demonstrated by several investigators. The disease-free 5 year survival is 30%, and in carefully selected series it is as high as 46%. These procedures can be performed safely with minimal morbidity and mortality by surgeons who are experienced in the techniques of radical surgery. It is important and should be our focus to try to identify those patients who will benefit the most from an aggressive surgical approach, by better definition of the biology of the tumor through tumor differentiation and DNA and oncogene analysis."
CD011134,0,2068447,0,Technical surgical considerations for CEA directed second-look operations and hepatic tumor excision.,"Surgical removal of recurrent metastatic colon and rectal cancer has provided many individuals with disease-free and treatment-free long-term survival of 5 or more years. Surgical removal of metastatic tumor from both lobes of the liver can be done with limited mortality and minimal complications when lesions are small and discovered early. Second-look operations should be performed when a persistently rising carcinoembryonic antigen is observed in the period after colorectal cancer resection, even when all other tests are negative. Repeat operations may be beneficial when all detectable disease was removed at the previous operation."
CD011134,0,2068445,0,Evaluation of a patient prior to second-look surgery.,"The evaluation of a patient with a suspected colorectal malignancy is well defined; however, the preoperative work-up of a patient who is a candidate for second-look surgery is controversial and based less on scientific evidence than on empiric or anecdotal grounds. The preoperative assessment of these patients can be divided into two phases. Phase I consists of a thorough history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests as the most logical and traditional starting point. Phase II consists of specific tests aimed at evaluating the extent of the recurrence and the resectability of the tumor. Of the various modalities available, the enhanced computerized tomogram is currently the method most likely to provide significant information prior to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) -directed second-look surgery. The results of the preoperative evaluation together with a thorough understanding of the natural history of the disease will offer a clear perspective as to the most likely outcome."
CD011134,0,2068444,0,Follow-up of patients after primary colorectal cancer resection.,Improved survival rates for patients with colorectal cancer may depend on early detection of metachronous colon lesions and early detection of distant disease. Frequent serial CEA determinations and history and physical examination are the two most useful techniques for diagnosing early recurrent disease. Colonoscopy rarely detects early recurrent disease but is useful in finding metachronous colon lesions. Other radiographic and hematologic examinations have an extremely low yield and should be used to localize and stage disease discovered by other means. Simplified follow-up can be expected to minimize early detection of recurrent and metachronous lesions yet offers minimal patient risk and expense.
CD011134,0,2066784,0,Anti-carcinoembryonic antigen immunoscintigraphy (technetium-99m-monoclonal antibody BW 431/26) and serum CEA levels in patients with suspected primary and recurrent colorectal carcinoma.,"This study comprises a total of 141 patients with suspected primary and recurrent colorectal carcinomas, in whom immunoscintigraphy with 99mTc-Mab BW 431/26 was performed. Whole-body scans were done 5.5 hr and SPECT imaging of the abdominal region was done at 6 and 24 hr postinjection of 1100 MBq 99mTc-labeled Mab (1 mg). In the course of primary tumor identification (n = 65), sensitivity of anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy was 95%, specificity 91%. In the diagnosis of early recurrences (n = 76), immunoscintigraphy was the method of choice to clarify the problem (sensitivity 94%; specificity 86%). Overall sensitivity of immunoscintigraphy in patients with suspected colorectal carcinomas and early recurrences was 95%, specificity 88%. Human anti-mouse antibodies were found in 29% (80% predominantly anti-isotypic, 20% predominantly anti-idiotypic). In contrast to anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy, the results of serum CEA levels were rather disappointing. Only 18 out of the 43 surgically verified primary colorectal carcinomas and 17 out of 32 patients with recurrences showed elevated serum CEA levels. In our clinical experience with this 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA antibody, immunoscintigraphy can play an important role in the identification of early colorectal recurrences and in postoperative colorectal cancer patients it should be performed in cases with unclear transmission computed tomography."
CD011134,0,2066759,0,Initial clinical study of indium-111-labeled clone 110 anticarcinoembryonic antigen antibody in patients with colorectal cancer.,"A murine monoclonal antibody directed against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was labeled with indium-111 (111In) by means of a benzylisothiocyanate derivative of diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) and used for clinical radioimmunodetection studies. Twenty-one patients having a history of surgically resected colorectal cancer and rising serum CEA levels suggestive of tumor recurrence were studied. Patients were infused over 20 minutes with 5, 10, or 20 mg of the monoclonal antibody labeled with 5 mCi of 111In. The mean radiochemical purity was greater than 96%. No toxicity was seen. The stability of the radiolabel on antibody in patient serum was demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with autoradiography, and immunoprecipitation for up to 96 hours after infusion. Tumor sites were identified in 20 of 21 patients. Sites of antibody accumulation in 20 patients were confirmed as tumor either by resection at laparotomy (16 patients) or fine-needle biopsy (four patients). Nine patients who had the identified lesion resected or irradiated showed return of the serum CEA antigen level to normal or near normal values. In the absence of high levels of circulating CEA (greater than 500 ng/mL), the disappearance of radioactivity from patient serum demonstrated first order elimination kinetics, with a mean half-life of 38 hours. The serum half-life was not affected by the dose of antibody administered or by serum CEA titers below 500 ng/mL. Despite a mean liver uptake of 18% injected dose (ID) 24 hours after administration, hepatic metastases were easily visualized as areas of increased uptake of radioactivity. Radioimmunodetection of recurrent colorectal cancer, not detected by computed tomographic (CT) scans, appears achievable with this agent. This may allow successful clinical intervention in selected patients."
CD011134,0,2059962,0,Radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) in recurrent colorectal cancer.,"Since 1986, 191 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer have undergone surgical exploration 2 to 43 days after injection of 1.0 to 0.25 mg of monoclonal antibody (MAb) (B72.3 or 17-1A) radiolabeled with 5.0 to 1.0 mCi of 125I. The intraoperative use of a hand-held gamma detector (Neoprobe 1000) demonstrated that MAb identified tumor in 73% of cases. Clearer intraoperative definition of tumor margins and identification of occult tumor assisted the surgeon in the resection of liver metastases as well as nodal and pelvic disease. Unsuspected nodal disease was identified. The external use of the Neoprobe to scan the sacral region and intrarectal and intravaginal use led to the avoidance of operative procedures by defining inoperable disease. In approximately 25% of cases, the surgical procedure was modified based on Neoprobe findings. RIGS system provides a method of immediate intraoperative staging which may prevent additional recurrences, lead to earlier institution of adjuvant therapy, and result in improved survival."
CD011134,0,2058325,0,[Value of endorectal sonography in the follow-up of patients treated surgically for rectum carcinoma].,"This prospective study included 80 patients in routine follow-up examinations after rectal cancer treatment. We performed anamnesis, clinical examination, total colonoscopy and endorectal sonography and tested the level of tumour markers CEA and CA 19-9. In 10 cases we detected local cancer recurrence of the rectal tumour. In 8 cases tumour markers were pathologically raised. Endoscopy detected the local recurrence in 4 patients only. Endorectal US was able to detect all of the recurrence cases. A histological confirmation was possible by EUS-guided needle biopsy in all cases. We were able to perform R 0-re-resection with the hope of curing in 4 patients out of 10 recurrence cases. Only endorectal US was able to detect two of those 4 recurrent tumours. In the follow-up of rectal cancer endorectal US seems to be a highly sensitive examination that may raise the number of re-resection with the hope of curing after rectal cancer treatment."
CD011134,0,2055140,0,Prognostic factors in colorectal carcinoma treated by preoperative radiotherapy and immediate surgery.,"The clinicopathologic staging of colorectal cancer is the subject of recent debate. We studied morphologic variables in a series of tumors resected from 284 patients. Half had been prospectively, randomly allocated to receive a 4-day schedule of preoperative pelvic radiotherapy followed by immediate surgery. There was a significant (P less than 0.01) difference in the distribution of tumors of various histopathologic grades between irradiated (XS) and unirradiated (S) patients and borderline differences in the predictive values of venous spread, tumor grading, and local spread. However, these differences were less marked in 180 tumors examined by one review pathologist. They were thought to be due to misinterpretation of changes induced by radiotherapy. No differences were detected in the distribution of tumors of various sizes and Dukes' stage in the XS and S groups. The review pathologist recorded a borderline (P = 0.049) difference in the distribution of tumors of various CEA staining patterns between the XS and S groups. In a Cox regression model. Dukes' staging remained the most important predictive variable for survival and pelvic recurrence in the XS and S groups. Dukes' staging was apparently unchanged by this schedule of preoperative radiotherapy, but Broders' grading may be unreliable. Any new clinicopathologic staging system for colorectal cancer should record when preoperative radiotherapy is delivered. More studies of radiotherapy effects are required."
CD011134,0,2045852,0,A prospective evaluation of hepatic resection for colorectal carcinoma metastases to the liver: Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group Protocol 6584.,"We report here the results of the first multiinstitutional prospective evaluation of patients considered to have potentially resectable hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma. One hundred fifty-six patients were enrolled from 15 institutions. Six patients were subsequently excluded. One hundred fifty patients underwent surgery and are evaluable for analysis (median follow-up time, 3.1 years; range, 4 months to 5.1 years). Curative resection could be performed on 46% of patients (69 of 150), noncurative resection on 12% (18 of 150), while 42% were found to be unresectable (63 of 150). Thirty-day surgical mortality and morbidity rates in patients with attempted resection were 2.7% and 13%, respectively. The curative resection group was observed to have an improved median survival (37.1 months) compared with the noncurative resection group (21.2 months) and the unresectable group (16.5 months) (P less than .01). Computed tomographic (CT) scan was a poor predictor for resectability, and age was not a contraindication to curative resection. Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) values were also a poor predictor for resectability. However, the median CEA value 61 to 180 days postsurgery was significantly higher in unresectable patients compared with median CEA levels in noncuratively and curatively resected groups (P less than .01). Our results imply that curative resection leads to an increase in median survival. Noncurative resection provides no benefit to asymptomatic patients, since unresectable and noncurative resection groups have similar life expectancies. Longer follow-up will be needed to demonstrate the ultimate impact of curative resection on survival."
CD011134,0,2044417,0,[Regional lymph node recurrence of colorectal cancer. Considerations of etiology and therapy based on angiography findings].,"Within a group of 101 patients treated for locally recurrent colorectal cancer 10 of them presented with a recurrence located in the lymphnodes of the primary tumor bed. This ""pseudo-recurrence"" shows some typical findings as elevated CEA serum levels in asymptomatic patients, and intact anastomosis endoscopically. However, angiography reveals the presence of the inferior mesenteric artery and it branches left behind at operation for the primary tumor. Furthermore, endoluminal ultrasound may be able to detect these situations. Both investigations are a must in patients following resection of a colorectal primary tumor of the left hemicolon or rectum being suspicious for a locoregional recurrence. Detection of a lymphnode recurrence may be of value in planning for a reintervention as it helps to select patients with a better chance for a curative surgical approach."
CD011134,0,2039134,0,Anastomotic recurrence of carcinoma of the colon and rectum. The value of endoscopy and serum CEA levels.,"The early diagnosis of anastomotic recurrence after surgery for carcinoma of the colon and rectum is difficult. Whether repeat colonoscopy and serial serum CEA measurements were useful in diagnosing early anastomotic recurrence was examined. A total of 112 patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum who had undergone resection and anastomosis were followed with frequent colonoscopy and serum CEA measurements. Seventeen patients developed anastomotic recurrence. Fourteen patients had elevated serum CEA levels, and 15 patients had endoscopic evidence suggesting recurrence at the anastomotic site. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated metastatic disease in seven patients, localized anastomotic disease in six patients, and no evidence of disease in four patients. Laparotomy was then carried out in 10 patients. In eight of 10 patients, it was possible to resect localized disease. In a 3-year follow-up study, eight patients were alive, four without any evidence of recurrent disease. Repeat colonoscopy and serum CEA measurements are recommended as postoperative surveillance for carcinoma of the colon and rectum. In select cases laparotomy and resection may prolong survival."
CD011134,0,2036931,0,Tumor markers in cancer of the colon and rectum.,"The primary role that tumor markers for cancer of the colon and rectum have at this time is for postoperative surveillance of those patients resected for cure who are at risk for recurrence of the disease. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels are followed by most surgeons prospectively after the potentially curative resection. This tumor marker has not been advocated as a screening test for these cancers; however, a preoperative CEA serum level is determined in those patients before the initial surgery for colon or rectal cancer. The serum level of CEA is mainly determined by tumor differentiation and stage of disease. If the CEA serum level begins to increase during the postoperative surveillance period, the recurrence of colon or rectal cancer must be suspected. Further investigations are then performed to identify the location and resectability of the recurrent disease. Monoclonal antibodies labeled with radioisotope are presently being used clinically to identify recurrence of colon and rectal cancer. Used in conjunction with elevated serum CEA levels (or other determinants of recurrent disease) these tumor markers can specifically identify site(s) of cancer recurrence. Theoretically, by attaching cancer-fighting agents (i.e., chemotherapeutic agents) to the monoclonal antibody, the site of tumor recurrence can be potentially treated, too. Hence, these ""tumor-seeking missiles"" may one day be used to treat cancer recurrence."
CD011134,0,2032318,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen in serum of patients with colorectal polyps: correlation with histology and smoking status.,"To measure the concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in serial serum specimens of 47 healthy subjects and in serial sera of 59 patients with colorectal polyps of confirmed histology, obtained before or after (sometimes both) polypectomy, we used the Roche EIA and the Hybritech Tandem-E double monoclonal immunoenzymometric assays. Both methods gave comparable results for the healthy subjects but discordant values for some polyp patients. The Tandem-E test gave increased CEA results more frequently for two groups of polyp patients, the group of ex-smokers with neoplastic polyps (n = 14) and the group of smokers (n = 20). Smokers had significantly greater (P less than 0.025) mean concentrations of serum CEA than did nonsmokers, irrespective of whether they were healthy or had colorectal polyps. Smokers with recurrent polyps demonstrated significantly greater (P less than 0.050) mean concentrations of serum CEA than did smokers with a first occurrence of polyps. Polypectomy was followed by statistically significant decreases (P less than 0.050) of mean concentrations of serum CEA, primarily in polyp patients who were smokers. However, although CEA increases occurred frequently in polyp patients who smoked, these abnormalities did not fully correlate with polyp histology."
CD011134,0,2027979,0,Liver metastases: results of percutaneous ethanol injection in 14 patients.,"Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) was performed under ultrasound (US) guidance in the outpatient department in 14 patients with 21 metastases 1.0-3.8 cm in diameter. The primary cancer was colorectal adenocarcinoma (seven patients), adenocarcinoma of the stomach (four patients), abdominal leiomyosarcoma (one patient), gastrinoma of unknown origin (one patient), and bronchial carcinoid (one patient). The indicators of therapeutic efficacy were US, computed tomography, fine-needle biopsy, and serologic markers. No complications occurred after a total of 175 treatment sessions. Complete response was obtained in 11 lesions, nine of which were less than 2 cm in diameter, and in all endocrine metastases (four lesions in two patients) with a maximum, recurrence-free follow-up of 38 months. Carcinoembryonic antigen values decreased in all patients but one for a 2-6-month period. The natural course of metastatic disease strictly limits the applicability of PEI, a local treatment. Single, metachronous, nonoperable metastasis of adenocarcinoma and endocrine metastases seem to be the only indications for PEI."
CD011134,0,2016627,0,Routine imaging studies for the posttreatment surveillance of breast and colorectal carcinoma.,"Current recommendations on follow-up procedures for patients who have been treated for cancer include imaging studies and other laboratory tests at relatively frequent intervals. At least two questions should be asked to evaluate the benefits of this practice for patients: Do frequent routine surveillance tests detect recurrences ""earlier"" in asymptomatic patients? and Does earlier treatment of these recurrences reduce morbidity or prolong survival? The practical import of surveillance with imaging and laboratory tests for recurrence in patients with cancer of the breast and colon is discussed. Reported autopsy data, findings at elective reoperation, and clinical data have been examined to ascertain the justification for routine periodic tests in the treated but asymptomatic patient. It is concluded that earlier detection of a local recurrence or of metastatic disease through periodic tests in the asymptomatic patient with breast or colon cancer rarely alters the treatment or the outcome. A notable exception is regular screening mammography following treatment for adenocarcinoma of the breast."
CD011134,0,2012403,0,[A case of local recurrence of rectal cancer successfully treated by UFT combined with two-route CDDP chemotherapy under the AT-II induced hypertension].,A case of local recurrence of rectal cancer was successfully treated by UFT combined with two-route CDDP chemotherapy under the AT-II induced hypertension. UFT (600 mg/day) was orally administered every day. CDDP (75 mg/m2) was infused into the right internal iliac artery via subcutaneously grafted Infuse-a-port under hypertensive state induced by the AT-II (3 micrograms/min). Sodium thiosulfate was intravenously given to protect the CDDP induced nephrotoxicity. The recurrence tumor palpated by digital examination and revealed by MRI disappeared after the fourth two-route CDDP chemotherapy. The serum CEA level elevated before the treatment also normalized. This combined chemotherapy was considered to be an effective measure to cure the local recurrence of rectal cancer.
CD011134,0,2010306,0,Radioimmunolocalization of pelvic recurrences from rectosigmoid cancer employing 111In anti-CEA F(ab')2.,"Thirty-two immunoscintigraphic studies have been performed in 26 patients previously operated upon for rectosigmoid cancer, for an early detection of pelvic recurrence, employing 111In anti-CEA, F(ab')2. The sensitivity was 1, specificity 0.76 and accuracy 0.84, leading to a positive predictive value of 0.69 and a negative value of 1. The combined use of a non-imaging surgical probe in 6 of the 10 patients who underwent second look surgery, detecting the 111In radioactivity used for RIS, improved diagnostic accuracy, ruling out the presence of tumors in 3 patients with false positive RIS."
CD011134,0,2010305,0,Immunoscintigraphy of colorectal carcinoma with an anti-CEA monoclonal antibody: a critical review.,"An anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (FO23C5), belonging to the IgG1a class, was used to perform several preclinical and clinical studies on radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) in patients with colorectal carcinoma. Preliminary screening on different tissues showed high specificity of this antibody for gastric and colorectal carcinomas. A pilot study on 51 patients with 64 localizations of colorectal carcinoma was realized, followed by a multicenter validation study in which, among 509 patients bearing CEA secreting tumors, 254 patients had primary or relapsed colorectal tumors. High sensitivity and specificity values were obtained by these studies and many ""unsuspected"" localizations were recorded. In order to better define the clinical utility of this approach, a prospective trial was run on 59 patients previously submitted to surgery for colorectal carcinoma and with suspected local relapses. A comparative evaluation of RIS, CT scan, US and MRI was performed. RIS and MRI have the highest value of accuracy (86%) followed by CT scan (68%) and US (54%). No adverse reactions were noticed in any of the patients examined."
CD011134,0,1999127,0,The value of radioimmunoguided surgery in first and second look laparotomy for colorectal cancer.,"Radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) using an anti-CEA (A5B7) monoclonal antibody has been assessed in 52 patients (43 primary excisions and nine second look procedures) undergoing surgery for colorectal carcinoma. The antibody localized in 97.8 percent of primary tumours and in 88.8 percent of the principal tumor in second look procedures. Additional information concerning the extent of primary tumor was obtained in 11 of 43 patients (25.5 percent) undergoing excision of primary carcinoma and five of nine patients (55 percent) in the second look series. Incorrect information was obtained about the extent of the primary tumour in six patients (11.3 percent), whereas no incorrect information was obtained during second look procedures. RIGS correctly predicted the subsequent Dukes' staging in 77 percent of first look cases (sensitivity 65 percent, specificity 90 percent), although accurate identification of individual nodes was impossible. The technique influenced the surgical procedure performed in 2 of 43 cases (4.6 percent) in primary surgery and in three of nine patients undergoing second look laparotomy (33 percent). RIGS in primary colorectal carcinoma may provide additional information concerning extent of locally advanced tumors in particular and the principle that the subsequent surgery may be influenced has been established. The technique appears to have a greater role in second look procedures where it may help determine the extent of recurrent tumour. Larger follow-up series are required to define how the additional information provided by this technique may best be exploited."
CD011134,0,1998972,0,Improved radioimmunotherapy of colorectal cancer xenografts using antibody mixtures against carcinoembryonic antigen and colon-specific antigen-p.,"Radioimmunotherapy of GW-39 human colonic tumor xenografts grown in the hamster cheek pouch with 131I-labeled NP-4 anti-(carcinoembryonic antigen) (CEA) and 131I-labeled Mu-9 anti-(color-specific antigen-p) (CSAp) murine monoclonal antibodies, administered in combination, was more effective than using either antibody alone for tumor masses less than 0.5 cm3 in size. The antibody mixture had no therapeutic advantage for larger tumors. Therapeutic efficacy was determined by measuring the change in tumor size over time, quantifying the absolute number of tumors responding to radioantibody therapy, and determining the percentage growth inhibition of each treatment at various times after radioantibody administration. Several mechanisms are discussed to explain the improved tumoricidal effect of the antibody mixture noted in this model system, such as (a) the possibility that an antibody mixture could target a greater number of tumor cells, (b) the potential for antibody mixtures to provide better tumor distribution and (c) the possibility that antibodies administered in combination can increase the magnitude of tumor uptake of individual radioantibodies, thereby resulting in a greater radiation dose delivered to the tumor."
CD011134,0,1998473,0,Prognostic significance of carcinoembryonic antigen in colorectal carcinoma. Serum levels before and after resection and before recurrence.,"The use of carcinoembryonic antigen was evaluated in 425 patients with a mean follow-up of 48 months. The preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels were predictive of recurrence and survival independent of the tumor stage. In a multivariate regression analysis of age, location, tumor stage, and preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, the latter three factors were significant prognostic variables with respect to the adjusted survival. Recurrent disease was found in 42% of patients, excluding patients with stage IV disease. The carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence was greater than 5 ng/mL in 79% of the patients and in 89% of the intra-abdominal recurrences. Carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence was not predictive of postrecurrence survival except in the subgroup of locoregional disease. The life span in patients with liver and lung metastases was not influenced by carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence. Preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels can indicate a poorer prognostic group of patients with colorectal cancer who may benefit from adjuvant treatment. The carcinoembryonic antigen at recurrence can be used effectively to diagnose intra-abdominal recurrences and project survival after development of local/regional disease."
CD011134,0,1992526,0,Advances in the management of gastrointestinal malignancies.,"Although progress in treating gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies has been slow, several new approaches have resulted in increased response rates and, in some cases, improved survival. A greater understanding of the etiology of GI cancers makes possible the prevention of many of these tumors. New diagnostic tools, including endoscopic ultrasound, the CA19-9 radioimmunoassay, and the carcinoembryonic antigen assay, have improved clinicians' ability to detect early-stage and recurrent disease. Efforts to enhance response to fluorouracil (5-FU) in the treatment of colorectal cancer by the addition of various immunologic or biochemical modulators have yielded encouraging results. Combinations of 5-FU with levamisole, interferon alfa, leucovorin, methotrexate, or N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate have resulted in significant increases in response rates and, in the case of 5-FU/levamisole, increased survival. Promising results have also been obtained in the treatment of pancreatic cancer with a combination regimen of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) plus chemotherapy (5-FU/doxorubicin/mitomycin) and in the treatment of hepatocellular cancer with an antiferritin MoAb/radioisotope conjugate. Finally, the addition of interferon alfa to 5-FU has produced improved response rates in preliminary trials in patients with esophageal cancer. Other strategies, such as attempts to enhance MoAb activity in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, may prove productive as well and are currently being explored in laboratory and clinical studies."
CD011134,0,1991262,0,Ultrasound-guided hepatic cryosurgery in the treatment of metastatic colon carcinoma. Preliminary results.,"Cryosurgery, the in situ freezing of cancer, has been proposed in the past as a possible treatment for unresectable hepatic tumors. Its advantage lies in the fact that it is a very focal treatment sacrificing less normal tissue than surgical resection, allowing treatment of multiple lobes. Because cryosurgery does not affect large vessels, tumors in difficult locations, such as adjacent to the inferior vena cava (IVC), can be treated. With the use of intraoperative ultrasound to place the cryoprobes and monitor the freezing process, 18 patients with unresectable metastatic colon carcinoma confined to the liver were treated. Of the 18 patients treated, 4 (22%) are in complete remission as determined by computed tomography (CT) scans and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, with a mean follow-up of 28.8 months. Four patients (22%) were not adequately treated at the time of cryosurgery. The number of lesions frozen in each patient ranged from 1 to 12, with a mean of 6 lesions. Fourteen patients had bilobar disease; three patients had previous right lobectomies with recurrences in their remaining left lobes prior to cryosurgery, and one patient had unilobar disease. Mean survival of the 14 cases with recurrence was 21.4 months, with 2 of the 14 still alive. Ultrasound-guided hepatic cryosurgery appears to be an effective treatment for metastatic colon carcinoma to the liver that is unresectable (including patients with bilobar and multiple lesions). These preliminary results indicate that the procedure warrants further study."
CD011134,0,1942906,0,[The tumor markers CEA and CA-19.9 in patients with colorectal carcinoma].,The levels of two tumor markers--CEA and CA-19.9 were repeatedly determined in 146 patients with histologically verified colo-rectal cancer and in 58 healthy controls. The normal CA-19.9 values were up to 30 U/ml. The sensitivity of the two markers proved to be low: 48.8 per cent for CEA and 37 per cent for CA-19.9. In 26 of 35 patients with local recurrence or metastases marker increase preceded the appearance of clinical symptoms of progression of the pathologic process. The two markers appeared more informative than each of them when separately determined.
CD011134,0,1936302,1,Value of follow-up in the management of recurrent colorectal cancer.,"The purpose of this article was to study the effectiveness of a prospective follow-up programme in patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. Of the initial 151 selected patients, 61 (40%) developed a recurrence in whom only six cases (10%) of potentially curable recurrent lesions were detected. The first clues to recurrence in the 61 patients were history or physical examination in 49%, a rising CEA in 29% and a positive imaging finding in 10%, being difficult to decide which test first signalled a recurrent cancer in an additional 11%. Endoscopy and CEA determinations were the most rewarding investigations. CEA was a sensitive means of identifying disseminated recurrent disease and liver metastases compared with liver function tests or liver ultrasound every 3 months. Endoscopy was useful in the diagnosis of local recurrences. However no follow-up test was capable of detecting recurrent colorectal cancer when it might still have been curable. As a direct result of this follow-up programme 15 patients (23%) underwent re-exploration. No symptomatic patients were candidates for curative re-operation. Of the asymptomatic patients six (four colonic and two rectal cancers) (19.5%) were re-resected for cure. Only three of these were alive and without evidence of disease, 40, 43 and 69 months later so that long term survivors after curative re-resection represent only 5% of all patients with recurrences (7.2% of the recurrent colonic cancer and 3% of the rectal cancer). Our follow-up programme did not permit us to alter the incidence of disseminated recurrent disease, and the effectiveness of the curative re-resection represents an increase of only 1.3% in the global 5-year survival rates for colorectal cancer. Our study does not demonstrate any great value of 'classical' postoperative follow-up programme."
CD011134,0,1933781,0,Tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 serum levels complement carcinoembryonic antigen levels in monitoring patients with gastrointestinal carcinoma. A longitudinal study.,"Eighty-two patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal (GI) adenocarcinoma were evaluated before and for 26 months after primary tumor resection for the presence of two serum tumor markers: tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Elevated TAG-72 and CEA serum levels were found preoperatively in 32 (39%) and 34 (41.5%) of the 82 patients, respectively. The percentage of patients with elevated serum levels of either TAG-72 or CEA was 56.1% (46 of 82). Twelve (15%) patients who had normal CEA serum levels had elevated TAG-72 serum levels, and conversely, serum from 14 (17%) patients who were TAG-72 negative were CEA positive. Forty-five of the 82 patients were diagnosed with advanced disease (i.e., Stages C and D for colorectal, Stages III and IV for stomach), and 29 (64.4%) and 26 (57.8%) of those patients had elevated serum levels of TAG-72 or CEA, respectively. Elevated levels of either TAG-72 or CEA, however, were found in sera of 82.2% of patients with advanced GI cancer, which is an increase of 24.4% over the use of CEA antigen alone as a marker of disease. The measurement of both TAG-72 and CEA may improve the diagnosis of patients with GI malignant disease due to the apparent complementary association which exists between these tumor markers. Serum TAG-72 and CEA levels were monitored in 31 patients for varying lengths of time after resection of the carcinoma; 11 patients developed recurrent disease. Sera from nine of 11 (81.8%) of these patients had elevated TAG-72 levels and six of 11 (54.5%) had elevated CEA levels. Tumor marker elevations were observed either before (35 to 166 days) or at the time of diagnosis of recurrence. The elevation of one or both markers correlated with the clinical status in ten of 11 (90.9%) patients with recurrence. In addition, 20 patients who were clinically free of disease after more than 700 days' follow-up had normal serum levels of both TAG-72 and CEA. These findings suggest that the combined use of serum TAG-72 and CEA measurements may improve detection of recurrence in patients with GI cancer and may be useful in the postsurgical management of GI adenocarcinoma patients."

A ""curative"" resection was performed in all of them. Clinical data from medical records, histology, biochemical determinations, and intraoperative findings were assessed. Four of the studied variables were significantly related to tumor recurrence: Dukes stage, tumor spread, histological variety and preoperative CEA level. Age, sex, tumor location, surgical technique, lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, preoperative levels of acute phase reactants and hepatic enzymes did not provide information about the final outcome of these patients.

CD011134,0,1929612,0,Second-look surgery for colorectal cancer. The second time around.,"Eighty-six colorectal cancer patients who entered the Radioimmunoguided Surgery (RIGS) protocol study were evaluated for 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year survival following second-look surgical procedures. Strict preoperative evaluation criteria eliminated patients with extra-abdominal tumor involvement. A saturated potassium iodide preparation was given before the intravenous administration of the B72.3 monoclonal antibody (1 mg) radiolabeled with 2 mCi of iodine-125 by the IODOGEN method. Precordial monitoring of the biologic clearance by the handheld, gamma-detecting probe (Neoprobe 1000 instrument) was conducted at weekly intervals until the average count was less than 20 counts in 2 seconds. Once the drug cleared from the blood, surgery was performed. The mean time interval between injection and operation was 24 days, with a range of 21 to 28 days and a median of 23 days. At surgery the abdomen was explored through the traditional methods of palpation and inspection, and the surgeon committed to a planned procedure. The abdomen was then re-explored with the handheld, gamma-detecting probe and the surgeon stated another intraoperative assessment. After using both traditional and RIGS detection methods, the surgeon stated whether his or her surgical plans changed because of the additional intraoperative information provided by the RIGS system. Fifty-three patients (62%) were deemed resectable by the traditional methods of palpation and inspection, but only 40 (47%) were specified as resectable by RIGS exploration. Two-, three-, four-, and five-year survival data could be gathered for each of the three groups: RIGS resectable (n = 40), traditional nonresectable (n = 33), and RIGS nonresectable (n = 13). At 2 years 95% of the resectable, 36% of the traditional nonresectable, and 53% of RIGS nonresectable patients survived. At 3 years 83%, 7%, and 30% of these patients survived, respectively. For the resectable patients, 74% survived at 4 years and 60% at 5 years, with no survivors from either nonresectable group. Use of the RIGS system increased accurate selection of resectable patients undergoing second-look surgery for recurrent colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,1926005,0,[Colorectal cancers: therapy of recurrences and metastases].,"Recurrent disease from colorectal carcinomas is common. 25 percent of patients have apparent metastases at the time of first detection of the tumor, and at least 50% of patients die from their tumor. The aim of the postoperative follow-up of patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum is thus to detect recurrent tumor when cure is still possible. Clinical examination and CEA-measurement is widely recommended as a reliable indicator for recurrence and metastases of colonic cancer. This may be combined with regular coloscopic surveillance for detection of anastomotic recurrences or a second colonic cancer. In case of suspicion of a recurrence or metastasis a full range of examinations should be performed to detect the site of recurrent tumor and to exclude wide spread disease. In case of a circumscribed lesion the patients may benefit from local radical resection. Patients with four or less unilateral liver metastases show a five year disease free survival reported of more than 30% and a disease free survival reported of more than 25%. Unfortunately because of wide spread misunderstanding of the potential of hepatic Rx only about 1/3 of potentially curatively resectable patients with liver metastases finally undergo liver surgery. A more active policy towards patients with colorectal disease concerning surveillance may lead to a better survival in selected cases."
CD011134,0,1926004,0,[Colorectal cancers: adjuvant therapy and after care (including tumor markers)].,"Perioperative adjuvant treatment after radical surgery for colorectal cancer has proven to be possible without an increase of postoperative complications and postoperative mortality. In overcoming this surgical fear, a number of randomized studies, all of them investigating the role of adjuvant treatment, have been initiated. Preliminary results of these trials show, some of them already statistically significant, an advantage of the adjuvant treated patient group. Unless these results have been confirmed, adjuvant treatment should only be given in well designed, randomized clinical trials. Only these trials can prove the effectiveness of adjuvant therapy in radical surgery of colorectal neoplasms. In addition, these studies should be used to define the group of patients who really benefit of adjuvant treatment. The main goal of follow up methods after surgery for colorectal cancer should be the detection of asymptomatic and still treatable tumor recurrences. For this reason, frequent clinical investigations and frequent CEA level determinations seem to be the most important components at this time."
CD011134,0,1914746,1,Role of carcinoembryonic antigen and liver function tests in the detection of recurrent colorectal carcinoma.,"The optimal laboratory evaluation for the early detection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer is controversial. This investigation was undertaken to compare the efficacy of liver function tests (LFTs) with that of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels for the early detection of liver metastases. Patients who developed liver metastases after potentially curative resections of adenocarcinoma of the colorectum between 1974 and 1988 were reviewed. The following laboratory tests were serially evaluated during the follow-up period: CEA, alkaline phosphatase (AP), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). These values were retrospectively assessed from the time of documented liver metastases to identify which lab value(s) were elevated initially. Ninety-two patients were available for study. Average time for the occurrence of liver metastases was 20 months (range, 3-72 months). The incidence of elevation of individual tests at the time of suspicion of liver metastasis was: CEA, 94.6 percent (P less than 0.25, chi-squared); AP, 18.5 percent; SGOT, 12.0 percent; SGPT, 5.4 percent; and LDH, 29.3 percent. When comparing CEA with a battery of LFTs at the time of suspicion of liver metastasis, CEA was elevated with normal LFTs in 64.1 percent (P less than 0.05, chi-squared), the most frequent occurrence. At least one LFT was elevated with a normal CEA in only 2.2 percent; CEA and at least one LFT were increased in 30.4 percent; and both tests were normal in only 3.3 percent. These results indicate that, of the individual laboratory tests performed, CEA elevation heralds liver metastases significantly more frequently. LDH is the liver function test most frequently elevated when liver metastases are first suspected. When CEA is directly compared with a battery of LFTs, CEA is statistically significantly more frequently elevated. In fact, suspicion of liver metastases would have been delayed by the omission of LFTs in only 2.2 percent of patients. Therefore, we conclude that LFTs should be deleted from the follow-up of colorectal cancer patients, decreasing costs without significantly decreasing accuracy."
CD011134,0,1914727,0,Clinical significance of tumor marker NCC-ST 439 in large bowel cancers.,"We examined serum NCC-ST 439 for its significance as a tumor marker of large bowel cancer in 121 patients with primary and 36 with recurrent large bowel cancer. Serum NCC-ST 439 was positive in 27.3 percent of the former and 66.7 percent of the latter. It was false-positive in only 5.6 percent of patients with benign diseases. Positive serum NCC-ST 439 correlated with lymph node and liver metastases. The combination assay for NCC-ST 439, CEA, and CA19-9 was positive in 49.6 percent of the patients with primary tumors and 88.9 percent of those with recurrent tumors; in other words, the diagnostic accuracy improved. The results demonstrated that the determination of serum NCC-ST 439 in large bowel cancer might be useful in cancer staging and that NCC-ST 439, if used in combination with CEA, is particularly useful in diagnosing recurrences because of its improved diagnostic accuracy."
CD011134,0,1913688,0,Comparison of immunoscintigraphy and computerized tomography in identifying colorectal cancer: individual lesion analysis.,"Monoclonal antibody scintigraphy with 111In-ZCE025 was used in presurgical staging of 45 patients prior to abdominal exploration for primary, recurrent or metastatic colorectal carcinoma. A total of 186 lesions were identified, of which 147 were evaluated by abdominal surgery and pathology. Sensitivity was 40.5% (49 of 121) for immunoscintigraphy (IS), 61.2% (74 of 121) for computerized tomography (CT), and 72.7% (88 of 121) for IS and CT combined. The positive predictive value was 83.1% (49 of 59) for IS and 88.1% (74 of 84) for CT. Sensitivity of IS was 100% (23 of 23) for primary tumors, 17.7% (11 of 62) for hepatic metastases, and 41.7% (15 of 36) for extrahepatic abdominal metastases. Of the 50 hepatic lesions evaluated by single-proton emission computerized tomography, 11 were localized by IS. Only one was visualized by planar scintigraphy. Sensitivity of CT was 87% (20 of 23) for primary tumors, 67.7% (42 of 62) for hepatic metastases, and 33.3% (12 of 36) for extrahepatic abdominal metastases. Sensitivity of IS combined with CT was 72.6% (45 of 62) for hepatic and 55.6% (20 of 36) for extrahepatic abdominal metastases. Of 24 malignant lesions measured by the pathologist to be less than 3.0 cm (maximum dimension), 7 (29.2%) were detected by IS and 3 (12.5%) by CT. Of 28 malignant lesions greater than 3.0 cm, 23 (82.1%) were detected by IS and 24 (85.7%) by CT. Overall, IS and CT complemented each other in presurgical staging of colorectal carcinoma. IS was of greater value for identification of extrahepatic and small metastases. CT was more effective for identification of hepatic metastases."
CD011134,0,1913687,0,"Identification of a novel tumor-associated Mr 110,000 gene product in human gastric carcinoma cells that is immunologically related to carcinoembryonic antigen.","A novel gene product which is immunologically related to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and constitutively expressed by six of eight human gastric carcinoma cell lines is described. The antigen was initially identified by the differential binding patterns of four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which recognize the putative Mr 180,000 CEA and/or the Mr 90,000 CEA-related gene product, NCA (normal cross-reacting antigen). Western blot analyses of partially purified membrane fractions prepared from Hs 746T gastric carcinoma cells identified an Mr 110,000 antigen. Northern blot analyses using CEA- and NCA-specific complementary DNA probes did not identify any specific CEA or NCA transcripts in polyadenylate-selected mRNA isolated from the Hs 746T cells. Likewise, a probe designed to hybridize with different CEA-related family members failed to identify a CEA-related message in the Hs 746T cells. Subsequent studies revealed that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) treatment substantially increased the level of expression of the Mr 110,000 antigen on the Hs 746T and five other gastric cell types that constitutively expressed the antigen. IFN-gamma treatment also de novo induced the expression of the Mr 110,000 antigen on the surface of GaCa gastric carcinoma cells. A high percentage of Hs 746T (i.e., greater than 85%) and GaCa (approximately 75%) gastric carcinoma cells expressed the Mr 110,000 antigen after IFN-gamma treatment; yet, neither cell type expressed CEA or NCA as measured by the binding of the anti-CEA MAb, COL-1, or B6.2, an anti-NCA MAb. In contrast to CEA and NCA, phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C treatment failed to release the Mr 110,000 antigen from the surface of the Hs 746T or IFN-gamma-treated GaCa cells, suggesting that membrane attachment of this novel antigen is not via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. Finally, primers that amplify the 420 base pairs of the immunoglobulin-like domain of CEA and NCA detected an appropriately sized product in untreated as well as IFN-gamma-treated GaCa cells using the polymerase chain reaction method. Thus, a potentially novel gene product coding for an Mr 110,000 antigen that is strongly upregulated by IFN-gamma has been identified in human gastric carcinoma cells. Immunologically, the antigen shares reactive epitopes with CEA and its related NCA gene product; however, Northern blot analyses, polymerase chain reaction, and phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C results suggest that the antigen may be, at best, a distant relative of the CEA gene family."

CD011134,0,1892526,0,Clinical evaluation of serum tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 as a novel tumor marker for colorectal cancer patients.,"A novel tumor marker, tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72), has been identified using monoclonal antibody (MAb) B72.3. Using immunohistochemical techniques, TAG-72 has been found in carcinomas of various origin including colon, stomach, breast, lung, prostate, and ovary, as well as in body fluids. The presence of TAG-72 in serum samples from 260 patients with colorectal disease (malignant or benign) has been evaluated using the CA72-4 assay. Approximately 40% of patients with colorectal cancer exhibit elevated levels of this marker; moreover, the presence of positive levels of TAG-72 significantly correlates with advanced stages of disease, suggesting that TAG-72 may be a good marker of advanced colorectal cancer. Only 2% of the patients diagnosed with colorectal disease had elevated TAG-72 serum levels indicating the high specificity of this marker. A comparative study with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels showed a complementarity of the two tumor markers; in fact, 49.6% of CEA negative cases scored positive for TAG-72. A longitudinal evaluation of TAG-72 serum levels in 31 patients with malignant disease was performed. The results indicate that patients with increasing TAG-72 serum levels postoperatively may be indicative of recurrent disease. In 60% of patients in which significant changes of CEA levels could not be detected, TAG-72 showed rising positive levels prior to clinical evidence of recurrent disease. These results suggest that the simultaneous use of TAG-72 and CEA serum markers may be useful in the diagnosis of recurrent disease and therefore play an important role in the clinical management of cancer patients."

CA-195 elevations above normal (greater than 10 U/ml) were noted in 51/72 (70.8%) colorectal, 15/15 (100%) pancreatic, and in 6/12 (50%) gastric cancer patients. Whereas CA19-9 was increased (greater than 37 U/ml) in 65%, 93%, and 42% of cases, only 54% colorectal, 45% pancreatic, and 42% gastric cancer patients had pathologically elevated serum CEA levels (greater than 5 ng/ml). No abnormal increase of both CA-195 and CA19-9 was found in healthy volunteers, whereas 3/20 (smoking) individuals had CEA levels slightly above normal. With a 29% false-positive rate noted among 103 patients with benign gastrointestinal disorders, the specificity of CA-195 was superior to that of CA19-9 (58%) and comparable with that of CEA (31%). A significant correlation between CA-195 levels and the clinical/pathological stage of disease was noted in colorectal (P less than 0.01) and pancreatic cancer patients (P less than 0.007). Preliminary results of serial measurements of CA-195 in colorectal cancer suggest that this new marker protein, which has no cross-reactivity with CEA, may be useful as a non-invasive test for postoperative surveillance of patients to detect disease recurrence, and serve to complement (though certainly not replace) standard clinical measurements of response to chemotherapy."

Out of 10 histopathologic variables, location of venous invasion was most significantly correlated with hematogenous recurrence: the rate (11%) of v0 and/or sm-pm v(+) in 50 patients without the recurrence was significantly lower than that (89%) in 28 patients with the recurrence. On the other hand, the rate (68%) of ss-extra(+) in the latter was significantly higher than that (32%) of the former. The mean values (6 and 14 ng/ml) and positive rates (22 and 48%) greater than 5 ng/ml of p and d-CEA in 50 patients without the recurrence were significantly lower than those (14 and 189 ng/ml, 48 and 96%) in 28 patients with the recurrence.

The first was a case of double cancers, one of which was sigmoid cancer without CEA production and the other a large cell lung cancer with CEA production. The evidence of elevated serum CEA level initially led to a wrong diagnosis as sigmoid cancer with lung metastasis. The second was a case which showed a relapse of monotonous cancer without CEA production after surgical removal of lung cancer tissue containing heterogeneous cancer cells. Elevated serum CEA levels were never observed after the operation, although the preoperative serum test was positive for CEA. The last was a case of squamous cell lung cancer which showed trophoblastic differentiation accompanied with massive hCG production. Very rapid tumor cell growth was seen after the early relapse following the operation. Positivity for hCG staining varied among primary and metastatic tumor tissues."
CD011134,0,1871479,0,[Patient selection and efficacy of tumor after-care in surgically treated colorectal carcinoma].,"Scheduled follow-up after surgically treated colorectal cancer remains controversial because eventually only about 5% of patients profit from it. Careful selection should therefore spare those patients unnecessary investigations who are least likely to benefit from follow-up. Only patients should be considered whose tumor was completely resected and who were found free of distant metastases. These patients should be fully informed about their disease and accept scheduled investigation even if asymptomatic. A questionable operability with regard to a second surgical intervention forbids formal entry into a follow-up program as well as a decreased life expectancy due to other disease. The family physician is most qualified to carry out or coordinate these investigations. For the first two postoperative years intervals of three and for the further three years of six months are recommended. Physical examination and determination of CEA titers are the essential measures; colonoscopy, sonography, CT scans, chest X-ray, and for rectal cancer, endoluminal sonography are undertaken periodically. In such a selected cohort one can expect a resectable recurrence in 25% of patients, of which 20% can be cured."

Antibody imaging contributed to surgical decision making through the detection of occult disease (12% of patients) and the confirmation of localized, potentially resectable disease without regional or metastatic spread. Seven patients (6%) experienced adverse effects, primarily fevers and itching, and 33% of patients developed antibodies to murine immunoglobulin after administration of 111In-CYT-103. The results of this study suggest that 111In-CYT-103 is a useful diagnostic tool for the presurgical evaluation of colorectal cancer patients."
CD011134,0,1867517,0,The influence of intraoperative hypotension and perioperative blood transfusion on disease-free survival in patients with complete resection of colorectal liver metastases.,"An increased interest in surgical treatment of liver metastases from colorectal origin has evolved recently. However not all patients benefit from this approach, with early recurrence and death still being encountered. To evaluate clinical as well as perioperative factors that might significantly affect the outcome of patients with completely resected colorectal liver metastases, we examined 116 patients who underwent resection between September 1987 and August 1989. Median follow-up time was 13.2 months (0.6 to 31.4 months). The overall survival rate was 91% at 1 year and 75% at 2 years. Median survival was not reached. Median disease-free survival time was 11.5 months, with 49.4% and 21.2% of the patients being free of disease at 1 and 2 years, respectively. By univariate analysis, site of primary colorectal cancer, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, size of metastases, number of metastases, length of operation time, percentage mean arterial pressure, number of hypotensive episodes, duration of hypotensive episodes, and whole blood transfusion significantly affected recurrence rate following resection. However only site of primary tumor, CEA, number of metastases, and number of hypotensive episodes remained significant in the multivariate analysis. The most significant single factor that affected recurrence rate was the number of hypotensive episodes during the operative procedure. It is concluded that hypotensive episodes, even when well controlled, should be avoided during operation to maximize the chances of cure and prolong disease-free survival of patients with colorectal liver metastases."

At 13 weeks after the start of this therapy, the pulmonary metastatic focus showed nearly complete disappearance. The condition above has been maintained until this writing, eight months after the start of this therapy. No recurrence has been observed in the liver and other organs either, while CEA has normalized from 17.6 ng/ml to 0.9 ng/ml. The therapy was discontinued after five courses based on the moderate loss of appetite and complete disappearance of the lung focus. No other side effect than the loss of appetite was detected, and could be safely treated at an outpatient clinic. The above findings suggested that this was an effective and safe therapy for pulmonary metastasis from colon cancers."
CD011134,0,1832005,0,An evaluation of the clinical usefulness of CEA in colorectal cancer.,"Carcinoembryonic antigen is the most common tumor marker in use today. Plasma CEA has no role as a screening tool for large patient populations but does correlate with tumor stage, prognosis, and extent of surgical resection for individual patients. Serial monitoring of plasma CEA levels can detect tumor recurrence prior to clinical or radiologic evidence of disease. An elevated or progressively rising post-operative CEA level is a definite indication for surgical reexploration, with the intent to surgically resect locally recurrent or metastatic disease. Finally, anti-CEA antibodies may be used in the future to improve preoperative staging and to treat colorectal carcinoma."
CD011134,0,1795132,0,The tumour marker CA 195 in colorectal and pancreatic cancer.,"The aim of this study was to measure the serum level of the tumour markers CA 195 and CEA in patients with either colorectal or pancreatic cancer both before and at serial intervals after operation. CA 195 and CEA were measured in 199 patients with colorectal cancer and 52 patients with pancreatic cancer. The median concentrations of CA 195 were 3.0 u/ml (interquartile range 3.0-4.5 u/ml) in patients with a Dukes' stage A lesion, 5.8 u/ml (3.0-18.2 u/ml) in patients with a Dukes' stage B lesion, 6.1 u/ml (3.0-24.7 u/ml) in patients with a Dukes' stage C and 23.8 u/ml (11.1-409.0 u/ml) in patients with metastatic disease (normal range 0-7 u/ml). The median levels of CEA were 2.6 ng/ml (1.7-3.3 ng/ml) for Dukes' stage A, 3.3 ng/ml (1.7-7.2 ng/ml) for Dukes' stage B, 3.7 ng/ml (2.2-7.9 ng/ml) for Dukes' stage C and 34.5 ng/ml (13.3-289.4 ng/ml) for metastatic disease. A rising level of CA 195 or CEA after operation suggested recurrence of the tumour. In none of these patients was the recurrence operable. In patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the level of CA 195 was significantly higher in patients with metastatic disease but it did not discriminate between resectable and unresectable disease. The duration of survival correlated with the initial level of CA 195 (Rs = -0.66, p less than 0.001)."

The study protocol included physical exam, blood biochemistry, chest X-ray, and CEA every 3 months (every 6 months after the third year) as well as an opaque enema, colonoscopy, abdominal echography, and pelvic CT scan (in case of abdominoperineal resection of a distal rectum cancer) every six months (once a year after the third year). Thirteen patients (15%) refused to participate in the study or abandoned it early, thus 71 patients are finally evaluated. After a mean follow up of 64 months, 32 patients presented a total of 42 recurrences (several patients underwent complete resection of the recurrence and presented new relapses). Recurrence diagnosis was always done by conventional exam (there was no second look guided by CEA values). Complete resection of the initial recurrence was achieved in 22% of cases (7 patients), but only 2 (6.5% of total relapses) are up to date tumor free and potentially cured after a long follow up. The most useful tests for the diagnosis of organ specific recurrences were chest X-ray (lung metastasis), liver echography (liver metastasis), liver echography (liver metastasis), colonoscopy (intraluminal local recurrence) and pelvis CT scan (pelvic recurrences). The carcinoembryogenic antigen was very specific, but only moderately sensitive, in predicting tumoral recurrency. However, CEA levels at relapse predicted the complete resection of recurrent tumor (58% with carcinoembryogenic antigen equal to or lower than 10 ng/ml compared to 5.5% with carcinoembryogenic antigen above this value p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A prospective study.,"We have analysed the relationship between carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and DNA ploidy prospectively in 130 colorectal carcinoma patients. CEA was elevated preoperatively significantly more often in patients with DNA-aneuploid tumours than in DNA-diploid or DNA-tetraploid tumours--that is, in 48% (36 of 75) of patients with aneuploid tumours, in 34% (14 of 41) of patients with diploid tumours, but only in 14% (2 of 14) of patients with tetraploid tumours (p less than 0.05). Aneuploid tumours had an elevated CEA level in 38% of stage A-B disease and in 61% of stage C-D disease. The elevated CEA values (greater than or equal to 5.0 micrograms/l) correlated with tumour stage in patients with aneuploid tumours but not in patients with diploid tumours. Whereas CEA is a suitable marker for aneuploid carcinomas, other more sensitive tumour markers should be sought for diploid and also for tetraploid tumours. If such markers are found, flow cytometry could provide the most important information in selecting individual follow-up programmes for colorectal cancer patients."

Five patients with colorectal cancer suspected were given an intravenous injection of 1 mg of 111In labeled ZCE-025. Planar and SPECT images were obtained 24 and 72 hours after injection. Surgical operation was performed on all patients between 7 and 10 days post injection. Of 4 primary sites, all were clearly visualized. Intrahepatic metastasis was visualized as higher activity than normal liver in one of two patients. In one patient whose imaging was negative, no residual cancer was found at surgery. Persistent accumulation of 111In in the lymph nodes was also observed in one patient. Surgical exploration of these lymph nodes showed no gross or microscopic evidence of metastases of colon cancer. No side effects were encountered, although HAMA were detected in all 5 patients by 4 weeks after the administration of ZCE-025. Immunoscintigraphy appears useful in distinguishing recurrent tumor from postoperative granuloma. Further investigation directed to the causes of 111In accumulation in tumor-free lymph nodes is required."

Results were compared with known serum marker levels and with the presence and localization of markers in the excised specimens. RIL images correctly identified 13 of 23 (52%) primary tumors, with only one false positive image. Scintigraphy of surgical specimens correlated with RIL findings in 14 of 19 cases (74%). Four specimens which showed antibody uptake had not been visualized preoperatively in the RIL study. Two of them were retrovesical and were obscured by residual activity in the bladder. Nine of 13 (64%) patients with at least one elevated tumor marker were imaged. Staining pattern or intensity of antigen staining in the specimens did not correlate with RIL findings. Recurrent disease was confirmed by laparotomy or other exploration in 10 of the 12 patients with progressive CEA elevation during follow-up. Spontaneous normalization of CEA levels was observed in the remaining 2 patients. RIL studies were positive in 7 of the 10 patients with confirmed recurrent disease. Of the 3 false negative patients 2 had liver metastases and one developed clinical lung, bone and adrenal metastases 11 months later.

For clinicians circulating TM are more important. All relevant circulating TM are not useful in screening of asymptomatic patients because of insufficient sensitivity and specificity. With caution they are useful in the observation of risk groups. Circulating TM have their main significance as additional parameters in monitoring symptomatic patients with malignancies. Several follow up determinations are more important than one single measurement. During follow up of tumor patients TM should not be checked automatically if there are no diagnostic or therapeutical consequences. The clinically most important circulating TM in non-hormone secreting tumors of the gastrointestinal tract are the oncofetal antigens CEA and AFP and antigens defined by monoclonal antibodies e. g. CA 19-9 and CA 72-4. AFP is the primary TM in hepatocellular carcinoma, often elevated in hepatoblastoma and always normal in cholangiocellular carcinoma. CEA is the TM of first choice in patients with colorectal carcinomas and liver metastasis. CA 19-9 is TM of first choice in pancreatic carcinoma and additionally of diagnostic value in cholangiocellular carcinoma and tumors of the bile ducts. In cancer of the stomach CA 19-9 and CEA are secondary TM in combination with CA 72-4 as primary TM. Care should be taken that slight and moderate elevations of TM can be observed in benign diseases of liver, pancreas and bowel."

In three of 11 patients who underwent laparotomy, clinical management was affected by the probe findings: localization of occult retroperitoneal disease, identification of an occult cecal lesion, and localization of residual disease at a site of local recurrence. Of all intra-abdominal lesions seen using any method, the probe identified 18 (86%) of 21, compared with 14 (67%) of 21 with the 111In-MoAb scan, 10 (48%) of 21 by computed tomographic scan, and 16 (76%) of 21 after surgical exploration. Uptake of 111In-MoAb in the portal (n = 3) and mediastinal (n = 3) lymph nodes was not associated with histologic findings of malignant neoplasms. For all pathologically confirmed extrahepatic and nonportal sites of cancer, the probe localized nine of nine, compared with five of nine by 111In-MoAb scan, two of nine by computed tomographic scan, and six of nine by surgical exploration. Important clinical uses of the intraoperative probe included occult lesion identification, localization of areas with 111In uptake shown with MoAb scanning, and verification of complete resection of areas with 111In-MoAb uptake."

TAG-72 was detected in the serum of a significant percentage of patients whose CEA levels were negative which underscores the possibility of exploiting the complementarity of the two tumor markers in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal (G.I.) carcinoma. Moreover, the measurement of TAG-72 may also be clinically useful in discriminating malignant from benign effusions. Serum TAG-72 and CEA levels were evaluated longitudinally in a series of patients following resection of primary G.I. carcinomas. A consistent relationship between efficacy of the surgery and serum TAG-72 clearance was observed, and TAG-72 alone or in combination with CEA accurately predicted recurrence of malignant disease in greater than 90% of the patients. The results indicate that TAG-72 is a new human serum tumor marker which, measured alone or in combination with other well established markers, may improve the diagnosis and/or clinical management of malignant disease."

Sixty percent of the patients had advanced tumours (T3 or T4) at the time of diagnosis, while 1/4 presented with metastases to the pelvic lymph nodes and 5% with distant metastases. The most frequent initial symptoms were anal bleeding and pain (38 and 23%, respectively). About 3/4 of the patients experienced more than 1 month's delay of diagnosis, either because of the patient himself (1/2 of the cases), doctor (1/5 of the cases) or hospital (1/10 of the cases). About 1/3 of the patients had more than 6 months' total delay. The follow-up after treatment (chemoradiotherapy) shows that frequent digital rectal examination is the most important procedure.

CD011134,0,1742739,0,Bifunctional antibody: a binary radiopharmaceutical delivery system for imaging colorectal carcinoma.,"In clinical studies we have evaluated a unique monoclonal antibody-based drug delivery system, a bifunctional antibody designed to deliver imaging or therapeutic agents, such as radioisotopes, drugs, or biologics, to tumor cells, while minimizing the dose to normal tissue. The bifunctional antibody, with one specificity to a tumor-associated antigen (carcinoembryonic antigen) and another specificity to a hapten, is injected and allowed to localize at a tumor site for 4 days. A hapten, tagged with a radioisotope, is subsequently injected for delivery to and capture by the prelocalized antibody at the tumor site. In studies reported here, the sulfhydryl groups of Fab' fragments of ZCE-025 and CHA-255 were linked with bis-maleimidomethyl ether to form an F(ab')2 bifunctional antibody coupled by a stable thioether linkage. EOTUBE, a hydroxyethylthiourido derivative of benzyl EDTA, was used as the hapten carrier of 111In. Fourteen patients 62-82 years old with recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon were studied. Twenty of 21 known lesions were imaged, and eight of nine new lesions were confirmed. With this fundamentally new approach to drug delivery, clearance from normal tissue is rapid, and high tumor:normal tissue ratios are expeditiously achieved."

The highest frequency of elevated CA 125 values (greater than 35 U ml-1) was found in patients with liver cancer (78%), but the level was equally often elevated in liver cirrhosis (78%). Two-thirds of the patients with biliary tract cancer had an increased CA 125 concentration, while four patients with benign biliary diseases had an elevated value. The serum level of CA 125 was elevated in only 20% of 60 patients with primary colorectal cancer, and in none of those with local disease (Dukes A or B). The CA 125 concentration seldom increased in patients with recurrent colorectal carcinoma. Twenty-three per cent of 44 patients with gastric cancer had an elevated CA 125 value. Two of 33 patients with benign colorectal and one of 68 patients with benign gastric diseases had an increased CA 125 concentration. The serum values of CA 125 showed no correlation with those of tumour markers alphafetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or CA 19-9. AFP was superior to the other markers in the diagnosis of liver diseases, while CA 19-9 showed the greatest accuracy in gastric diseases. In colorectal diseases, CEA had a higher sensitivity, but a lower specificity than CA 125 and CA 19-9.

CD011134,0,1714497,0,PET studies of fluorodeoxyglucose metabolism in patients with recurrent colorectal tumors receiving radiotherapy.,"Forty-four patients with recurrent colorectal carcinoma were examined prior to a combination of conventional photon radiotherapy (40 Gy) and neutron therapy (10 Gy). Twenty-one of these underwent a PET examination after photon therapy and 12 also were studied after the end of combined therapy. CEA plasma levels were measured from blood samples taken immediately before the PET study. A significant decrease in FDG uptake despite good palliative results were observed in only 50% of the patients. This may be explained by inflammatory reactions caused by radiation injury. Inflammation and metabolically active residual tumor tissue cannot be distinguished. It is concluded that an observation interval longer than 6 mo may more effectively detect residual tumor activity. In 14 of 41 examinations, an increased FDG uptake was associated with a normal CEA value, and in only two cases were normal FDG uptake values and increased CEA levels found, suggesting that PET is more sensitive than the measurements of CEA plasma levels for tumor recurrence."

During the investigation 16 patients who had undergone radical operation with any signs of recurrence and 36 patients with suspected tumor recurrence, scintigraphic false-positive results were observed in 12.5 and 30.6% patients, and a false-positive increase in the CEA titer was observed in 12.5 and 11.1%. Of 11 patients with false-positive scintigraphic results a rise of the CEA level was noted in 2 cases making it possible to rule out with a great degree of assurance the presence of a recurrent tumor.

CD011134,0,1703330,0,Reoperation for colorectal carcinoma.,"In the management of the patient with intra-abdominal recurrence of colorectal carcinoma, surgery remains the primary mode of therapy when cure or significant palliation is anticipated. Appreciation of the importance of close follow-up after primary resection coupled with improved diagnostic modalities has allowed the surgeon not only to detect earlier recurrence but also to select the patients most likely to benefit from resection of recurrent disease. Improved surgical techniques with resultant decreases in the rates of morbidity and mortality have allowed safe hepatic resection of metastatic disease. In selected patients, this procedure produces 5-year survival rates approaching 50%. Although a clear consensus has not been reached, most studies agree that positive prognostic indicators include absence of extrahepatic disease, a small number of intrahepatic lesions, a low CEA level, and a better Dukes stage of the primary. Likewise, in the patient with recurrent disease locally, surgery provides the only means of cure and also plays a significant role in palliation. Aggressive resection with generous surgical margins in patients with contained disease may yield 5-year survival rates approaching 35%. In patients with unresectable disease and even in those with carcinomatosis, palliation can be obtained by surgical therapy. Judgment is necessary in treating these patients both preoperatively and intraoperatively. Surgical intervention for obstruction, perforation, or other anatomic or physiological compromise is often indicated and can improve the quality of life of the patient with intra-abdominal recurrence."

The goal of detecting both primary and recurrent disease at an earlier stage remains elusive, but in some cases it may now be attainable. Improvements in surgical technique and instrumentation have led to the utilization of a variety of procedures for treatment, including more conservative operations for colorectal carcinoma detected at an early stage. Active specific immunotherapy using the patient's tumor cells to create a vaccine may improve the rate of survival in a disease for which no adequate adjuvant therapy currently exists. Further basic scientific and clinical research involving diagnostic and treatment modalities for colorectal carcinoma may lead to improved patient survival rates in the future."

Successful localisation was seen in all patients with primary and 80% of the metastatic NSCC, 50% of primary and 70% of metastatic breast cancer lesions and in 80% of patients with metastatic ovarian cancer. On the other hand, imaging carried with a radiolabelled non-specific monoclonal antibody produced positive results in 3 out of 5 cases with primary NSCC. Therefore non-specific imaging should be further studied in clinical research for the evaluation of the specificity of radioimmunodetection. In our therapeutic trials we have so far treated 29 patients with resistant ovarian cancer, with intraperitoneal 131I-labelled antibodies (HMFG1, HMFG2, AUA1, H17E2), 11 patients with recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions by intracavitary 131I-labelled antibodies, 10 patients with brain gliomas by intravenous or intracarotid infusion of 131I-EGFR1 and two patients with hepatic metastases from colon carcinoma by intrahepatic infusion of 131I-anti-CEA antibodies.

A prospective study using image cytometry.,"In a prospective study, the DNA content of Feulgen-stained nuclei obtained from fresh samples of 211 colorectal adenocarcinomas was evaluated by means of image analysis. The DNA histogram classification took into account aneuploidy and S-phase fraction for diploid cases. No significant relationship was found between ploidy and sex, age, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), size of the tumor, histologic differentiation, or Dukes' stage. Aneuploidy was more frequently encountered in distal tumors. Preoperative CEA, histologic differentiation, Dukes' stage, and ploidy were individually associated with overall survival. In Dukes' A, B, and C tumors, patients with normal and elevated CEA had no significant difference in overall survival. A relationship was apparent between disease-free survival and site, histologic differentiation, Dukes' stage, and ploidy. Multivariate overall survival analysis did not reveal independent prognostic significance of ploidy when all Dukes' stages were considered. In contrast, Dukes' stage, differentiation, and ploidy were good indicators of higher risk of colorectal cancer-related death in patients undergoing curative surgery. Dukes' stage and ploidy were also indicators for recurrence. Thus, routine histopathologic characteristics should be used in combination with quantitative cytologic features for the definition of a relevant prognostic index in colorectal cancer."

Survival curve of the patients with d-p CEA gradient greater than 10 ng/ml was significantly (p less than 0.001) lower than that of the gradient less than 10 ng/ml, and 4-year survival rates were 37.5% in the former patients and 68.3% in the latter patients. These results suggest that d CEA and d-p CEA gradient may be used as prognostic indicators of colorectal cancer patients. Clinically, the patients with positive d-p CEA gradient greater than 10 ng/ml are necessary to be treated as patients having very poor prognosis."
CD011134,0,2379594,0,Resection of liver metastases in colorectal cancer--competitive analysis of treatment results in synchronous versus metachronous metastases.,"One hundred and twenty-two patients underwent liver resection for metastases of colorectal cancer within 8 years. Seventy-four of them were treated for metachronous metastases detected in a median of 18 months after resection of the primary tumor. In another 48 patients the metastases were resected at the same time as the primary cancer. Both groups were analysed for disease-free and overall survival, and for peri-operative morbidity. However, neither the type of hepatic resection nor peri-operative morbidity showed relevant differences in the groups, except for the metachronous group, the only group in which operative mortality occurred (6.7%). Survival was not significantly different, being 32 months in the metachronous and 24 months in the synchronous groups (P = 0.051). However, disease-free survival showed significant differences; no patient in the synchronous group experienced a recurrence-free interval of more than 3 years. The median time interval until diagnosis of a recurrence was 10 months after resection of metachronous metastases, but only 6 months in the synchronous group (P = 0.018). The pattern of recurrence showed a much higher proportion of patients with disseminated disease in the synchronous group (95% vs 42%). Therefore, liver resection in synchronous colorectal metastases should be handled very restrictively and adjuvant treatment strategies considered in the future."

In 58.1% of the patients the CEA increase preceded the recognition of recurrence, and in 13.4% the diagnosis could be confirmed only by a second-look operation. In 46.7% of the re-operated patients a potentially curative resection of the locally recurrent or metastatic disease could be performed. The resectability was significantly lower in patients with symptomatic recurrent disease (34.5%) as compared to asymptomatic patients with CEA-directed positive imaging (52.7%) and the second-look patients (62.5%) respectively. A significant improvement in survival could be achieved especially in the second-look operated patients."
CD011134,0,2379590,0,"Lectins and immunohistochemistry of colorectal cancer, its recurrences and metastases.","In 31 patients resected specimens from primary colorectal cancers, corresponding liver metastases and local recurrences were investigated for the staining pattern of lectins (PNL, UEA, WGA, HPA, SBA, RCA) and tissue antigens (CEA, SP, ACT) by immunohistochemistry. Comparison of staining patterns showed a loss of marker expression from normal colonic mucosa to colorectal primary carcinomas, and a tendency to marker loss from the primary tumour to liver metastases. However, even a neo-expression of markers not present in the primary tumour could be observed. For clinical use, serum markers observed in patient follow-up may be valuable even where the findings are negative at the time of primary tumour surgery. In contrast to the heterogenous marker map of primary tumours and metastases, comparison of primary and locally recurrent tumour revealed a staining pattern that was almost always identical. This supports the hypothesis that locoregional recurrences develop from remnant cells of the primary tumour left behind at surgery. There is no support for the thesis that locoregional recurrences arise from mucosal changes at the anastomosis or from suture material."
CD011134,0,2373466,0,Tumor implantation from needle biopsy of hepatic metastases.,"Two patients with resectable secondaries in the liver developed needle track recurrence following intraoperative ""Trucut""-needle biopsy and percutaneous thin needle aspiration cytology, respectively. In both cases the nature of the hepatic lesion was already clear before biopsy, from characteristic ultrasound, CT-scan, and a progressive rise in CEA levels. Although the overall risk is presumably low, biopsy must not become a diagnostic imperative. It may compromise definitive surgery in individual patients, and should therefore be restricted to situations in which results have a therapeutic or scientific impact."

It has been suggested that peroperative radioimmunolocalisation may improve this assessment. The degree to which this is possible has been studied using a hand-held gamma detecting probe and comparing two 125I-labelled monoclonal antibodies to colorectal tumours. The antibodies were to fetal colonic microvillus membrane (FM1D10) and to carcinoembryonic antigen (A5B7). Sixty-nine per cent (9/13) of the FM1D10 and 98% (43/44) of A5B7 labelled tumours took up significant amounts of antibody with a tumour to normal colon ratio of more than 1.5:1. The uptake was significantly better for A5B7 with a median tumour to normal colon ratio of 3.3 (1.1-13.8) compared to 1.85 (0.75-7.7) for FM1D10 (P less than 0.001). The tumour: colon ratio of both antibodies was independent of the serum CEA, Dukes' stage or the degree of histological differentiation. There was a linear correlation for tumour to normal colon ratios between the gamma detecting probe and the same tissue examined in a conventional well counter (correlation coefficient r = 0.78, P less than 0.001). Colorectal tumours demonstrate a rapid and reliable uptake of anti-CEA monoclonal antibody A5B7. This antibody can be detected with a peroperative gamma detecting probe and has the potential to improve the surgeon's appreciation of the extent of tumour and therefore may influence the surgery performed. Detailed clinical studies are now being carried out."
CD011134,0,2369311,0,Radioimmune localization of occult carcinoma.,"Patients with a rising serum carcinoembryonic antigen level and no clinical or roentgenographic evidence of recurrent or metastatic cancer present a treatment dilemma. Eleven such patients, 10 with a previously treated colorectal carcinoma and 1 with a previously treated breast carcinoma, received an injection of the anticarcinoembryonic antigen monoclonal antibody ZCE-025 labeled with the radioisotope indium 111. Nuclear scintigraphy was performed on days 3 and 5 through 7 to detect potential sites of tumor recurrence. The monoclonal antibody scan accurately predicted the presence or absence of occult malignancy in 7 (64%) patients. Second-look laparotomy confirmed the monoclonal antibody scan results in the patients with colorectal cancer, and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed metastatic breast cancer. This study demonstrates that In-ZCE-025 can localize occult carcinoma and may assist the surgeon in facilitating the operative exploration. In-ZCE-025 assisted in the initiation of adjuvant therapy for the patient with breast cancer."
CD011134,0,2367057,0,Serial determinations of serum CEA in monitoring management of patients with colorectal carcinoma.,"Serum concentrations were determined serially in two groups of patients with colorectal carcinoma: in 123 after curative resection and in 34 with residual cancer. Of the first group, in 98 serum CEA fluctuated within the normal range or with a 2-fold larger amplitude evidencing effective surgery because only 9 had recurrence; in 25 serum CEA rose persistently from a postoperative nadir indicating relapse, mostly liver metastases. Of the 34 patients with relapse, 3 had clinically and 7 CEA-directed second-look laparotomy; although 7 had operation with curative intent, only 3 remained disease-free. In the second group, there were 26 patients after palliative surgery and 8 during nonsurgical treatment. Serum CEA fluctuated within the normal range in 2 patients in remission and in 3 with progressive cancer, and rose in parallel to cancer progression in 29. Thus, serum CEA within or slightly above the normal range was 88% predictive that the patient might be free of disease or in remission; whereas elevated or rising level indicated disease progression. Accordance between serum CEA and clinical status occurred in 145 of 157 (92%) patients."
CD011134,0,2363558,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen directed multiple surgical procedures for recurrent colon cancer confined to the liver.,"During the past 14 years, eight patients have undergone two or more major hepatic procedures in an attempt to control metastatic colon cancer confined to the liver. A total of 19 operations was performed. In all cases, a rising level of carcinoembryonic antigen was the main indicator for surgical intervention. There were no operative deaths. Major complications occurred in 15 per cent. Following the first hepatic intervention, two patients remain alive and free of disease at 43 and 47 months (56 and 100 months since diagnosis), respectively. In the six patients who have died, survival from the first hepatic intervention ranged from 17 to 38 months (median 27 months). Age, sex, location of primary, size of primary, interval from primary operation to second operation, and site of hepatic metastasis did not influence survival. In carefully selected patients with metastatic colon carcinoma confined to the liver, encouraging results can be obtained by performing multiple surgical procedures."
CD011134,0,2352657,0,Cancer recurrent at stapled colon incision.,Recurrence of colon cancer at a stapled colotomy site separate from the anastomosis was discovered through a rising carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Resection resulted in cure. Exfoliation and implantation of cancer cells is discussed.
CD011134,0,2348233,0,Iodine-131-labeled MAb F(ab')2 fragments are more efficient and less toxic than intact anti-CEA antibodies in radioimmunotherapy of large human colon carcinoma grafted in nude mice.,"During one week, beginning 18 days after transplantation, nude mice bearing human colon carcinoma ranging from 115 to 943 mm3 (mean 335 mm3) were treated by repeated intravenous injections of either iodine-131-(131I) labeled intact antibodies or 131I-labeled corresponding F(ab')2 fragments of a pool of four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against distinct epitopes of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Complete tumor remission was observed in 8 of 10 mice after therapy with F(ab')2 and 6 of the animals survived 10 mo in good health. In contrast, after treatment with intact MAbs, tumors relapsed in 7 of 8 mice after remission periods of 1 to 3.5 mo despite the fact that body weight loss and depression of peripheral white blood cells, symptoms of radiation toxicity, and the calculated radiation doses for liver, spleen, bone, and blood were increased or equal in these animals as compared to mice treated with F(ab')2."
CD011134,0,2342376,0,Brachytherapy in the treatment of solitary colorectal metastases to the liver.,"It is well-established that 30-40% of patients with solitary liver metastases from primary colorectal tumors can be cured by resection. Conventional radiation therapy has had only a palliative role in treating liver metastases because the dose that the liver will tolerate is far below a tumoricidal dose. In contrast, brachytherapy allows one to deliver a tumoricidal dose to the tumor while limiting the dose to surrounding normal tissue to the tolerance dose. As a pilot study, 125I seeds were implanted into unresectable hepatic metastases, or positive margins of resection, at the time of surgery. This report concerns six patients whose liver lesions were the only known site of disease and in whom precipitous drops in carcinembryonic antigen (CEA) levels followed the implants. Recurrence was observed in only one of the 11 implanted site, with a median follow-up of 12 months."
CD011134,0,2337875,0,Utility and cost of carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring in colon cancer follow-up evaluation. A Markov analysis.,"The use of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) to monitor patients after intentionally curative colon cancer resection can have advantages (improved life expectancy as a result of early detection of recurrences) as well as disadvantages (false-positive CEA rises and early detection of incurable recurrences in asymptomatic patients). This study estimated how the favorable and unfavorable effects of CEA monitoring affect life expectancy and quality of life of colon cancer patients. These effects were simulated using a Markov analysis for which the variables had been defined on the basis of data found in literature. The influence of CEA monitoring on quality adjusted life expectancy appears to be modest and varies, according to the data used, from an average increase of +7 days (+0.3%) to an average decrease of -5 days (-0.09%). This value is dependent, among other things, on patient related variables; the adverse effects especially dominate in older patients with a favorable Dukes' stage of the primary tumor and if operative mortality exceeds 2%. The total cost of CEA monitoring, including diagnosis and therapy performed as a result of true- or false-positive CEA rise, is considerable. High cost and low return leads to a high marginal cost-effectiveness ratio, which varies from $22,963 to $4,888,208 per quality adjusted life year saved. It is concluded that CEA monitoring should not be used for routine following of colon cancer patients, as its advantages have so far been demonstrated insufficiently."
CD011134,0,2329893,0,[The significance of the preoperative CEA value for the prognosis of rectal cancer].,"254 patients were operated for rectal carcinoma in the period from 1980 to 1986. The number of curative procedures, recurrence rate and 5-year-survival rate were dependent on the preoperative CEA levels, which correlated with the tumour stage. Even within tumour stages with enough cases for statistical evaluation the CEA could be established as an independent prognostical variable. Within stage pT2N0M0 recurrence rate for patients with preoperative CEA level below 5 ng/ml was 29% compared to 64% in patients with higher serum levels. Median survival time for the two groups were 65 and 35 months, respectively. In stage of lymph node involvement median survival times of 46 and 25 months were observed for the groups with CEA levels above and below 5 ng/ml. The pattern of recurrence within the two stages seemed to be unaffected by the preoperative CEA level. Patients with preoperative elevated CEA represent a risk group with need of consistent postoperative follow-up and CEA controls."
CD011134,0,2329866,0,[Clinical application of radioimmunolocalization in colorectal cancer].,"We present preliminary results of radioimmunolocalization (RIL) of colorectal cancer with 131I labelled F(ab')2 fragments from monoclonal anti CEA and anti CA 19.9 antibodies in 22 patients with colorectal cancer and in one patient with metastases of unknown origin and high CEA value. Positive images were obtained in 7 of 11 primary tumors from 10 patients evaluated preoperatively; in 2 of 3 recurrences; in 9 of 12 metastatic localizations and in the unknown primary tumor localized, finally in the cecum. One local recurrence was not detected by any diagnostic methods, but RIL. There was not false-positive images. Therefore, RIL appears as a promising method for the diagnosis and follow-up of colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,2321973,0,[The relation between serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and response to chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer].,"Prognostic factors from 22 cases of advanced colorectal carcinoma were examined with respect to age, the degree of cellular differentiation, pretreatment serum CEA and doubling time of circulating CEA. The prognoses were very poor for patients of younger age and poorly differentiated tumor. No correlations were observed between survival time and pretreatment serum CEA. A significant correlation of survival time and CEA doubling time was observed. The serial serum CEA levels were examined in the 11 colorectal cancer patients with unresectable multiple liver metastasis, who were treated with intraarterial selective chemotherapy. There were no significant differences between pretreatment serum CEA and survival time on response to chemotherapy. In 9 cases showing over 40 ng/ml of CEA before treatment, however, the serial change in CEA levels correlated well with response to chemotherapy. In four cases with recurrent liver metastasis, prolongation time could be predicted from the CEA induces with respect to the forward time earning and the alternation of the CEA doubling time. Furthermore, the two cases without any measurable lesions also showed the same trend. These results suggested that serial measurement of serum CEA were useful for monitoring the response to chemotherapy against advanced colorectal cancer when the pretreatment serum CEA was high (over 40 ng/ml)."
CD011134,0,2314825,0,Advanced colon cancer: staging and prognosis by CEA test.,"The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test was studied in 54 patients with advanced stages of colon cancer which was treated with high doses of folinic acid + fluorouracil. The CEA test correlates evaluated included: prognostic value, performance status, metastatic pattern, histologic grading, predictive value for response to chemotherapy, and value differences in cases with partial response to therapy. CEA levels less than 5 ng/ml corresponded to a greater survival time than did levels greater than 5 ng/ml. A correlation of CEA with performance status and with metastatic pattern was demonstrated. A progressive increase in average CEA values corresponded to increases in neoplastic mass. Although CEA levels were not found to be an index for predicting the response to chemotherapy, there was a significant different between pre- and posttreatment levels for partial response. The results suggest that CEA offers an additional criterion for evaluating the response of colon cancer to chemotherapy and it also has a role in the staging of advanced disease."
CD011134,0,2304284,0,A proposal of indices to describe the carcinoembryonic antigen time course in in order to assess the effects of treating recurrent colo-rectal carcinoma.,"In order to assess the effects of treating recurrent or non-resectable colo-rectal cancer, the following 5 indices for the serum CEA time course were devised: 1. If the serum CEA doubling time is altered by any treatment from D1 to D2 we term D2/D1 as the ""CEA doubling time ratio"" of the treatment; 2. the per cent decrease in the serum CEA level from CEA1 to CEA2 is calculated by (logCEA1 - logCEA2) X 100/logCEA1; 3. the period when the CEA level has returned to normal after a treatment is termed the ""normalization period""; 4. ""backward time retrieval"" is the period between the lowest point of the posttreatment CEA and the crossing-point of this level by the pretreatment rising slope and; 5. ""forward time earning"" can also be defined. By using these indices, surgical treatments resulted in a higher per cent decrease in CEA, a longer normalization period but a shorter doubling time when the tumor recurred."
CD011134,0,2302062,0,Indium 111 ZCE-025 immunoscintigraphy in occult recurrent colorectal cancer with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level.,"We investigated the utility of scanning with indium 111 labeled to monoclonal antibody in 13 patients after curative resection of colorectal cancer who had elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels and negative results of clinical workup. Each patient received 1 mg of anti-carcinoembryonic antigen monoclonal antibody type ZCE 025 labeled with 5.5 mCi of 111In, plus 9 to 39 mg of the same antibody unlabeled. Patients underwent scanning 3 to 7 days after infusion by planar and emission computed tomography. ZCE-025 monoclonal antibody imaging detected tumor recurrence or metastasis in 11 of 13 patients. In one patient the monoclonal antibody scan gave a true-negative result, and in one patient the monoclonal antibody scan failed to disclose a metachronous cecal primary. Tumor sites identified were the pelvis (2 patients), abdominal wall (2), retroperitoneum (1), lymph nodes (3); liver (2), bone (2), and lung (1). The accurate localization of colorectal carcinoma recurrences by means of 111In ZCE-025 monoclonal antibody demonstrates the usefulness of this diagnostic agent in the setting of elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level and negative results of clinical and radiologic workup."
CD011134,0,2300891,0,Photon-neutron therapy for recurrent colorectal cancer--follow up and preliminary results.,"26 patients with unresectable locally recurrent adenocarcinoma of the rectum were treated with a mixed beam schedule. 40 Gy photons were delivered to the whole pelvis followed by a neutron boost of 6.6 or 10 Gy. Neutron therapy was carried out with a 14 MeV d-t generator (KARIN) using an isocentric are technique. Fluctuation in neutron dose rate during irradiation was monitored by a computer which controlled the gantry speed. All patients were followed clinically by CEA monitoring and CT-scans. In 18 patients positron-emission-tomography (PET) was used to verify the therapeutic efficacy. All patients were symptomatic with severe pain prior to therapy. After a mean follow-up interval of 12.8 months (range six to 26 months), the palliative effect in terms of pain relief was excellent in 22 patients in spite of the poor general condition of most patients and the large tumor extension. In four patients, further pain symptoms developed again after six to nine months due to renewed tumor progression. We observed proctitis at late side effects in one, enteritis in two and a fistula in one patient six to ten months after therapy. Changes in tumor glucose metabolism were monitored by serial PET examinations in all patients. The typical pattern observed by PET was a decrease in the F-18-Deoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation, approximately six weeks after onset of therapy."
CD011134,0,2297664,0,"Polyamines in colorectal cancer. Evaluation of polyamine concentrations in the colon tissue, serum, and urine of 50 patients with colorectal cancer.","Total, free, and acetylated polyamine concentrations were measured simultaneously in colon tissue, serum, and urine of 50 patients with histologically proven colorectal cancer, 40 patients with nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases, and 30 healthy volunteers. Compared with histologically unaffected colon tissue, concentrations were significantly (P less than 0.001) higher for putrescine, elevated for cadaverine, and nearly identical for spermidine and spermine in colon carcinoma, whereas N1-acetylated and N8-acetylated spermidine were detectable in cancer tissue only. Serum and urine concentrations of all polyamines except total cadaverine and spermine in serum and free spermine in urine were significantly elevated compared with healthy controls and highest sensitivity for colon cancer was found for total spermidine (89.15%) in serum and acetylputrescine (84.5%), total putrescine (84.0%), N1-acetylspermidine (79.3%), and total spermidine (92.1%) in urine. However, nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases partly showed similar elevations which resulted in a low specificity for polyamines in colorectal cancer. Therefore, polyamines are of little value only as diagnostic markers in colorectal carcinoma. Since polyamine concentrations in serum and urine normalized in patients after curative operation while they were further elevated in patients with proven tumor relapse or metastases, these substances might play a clinical role in predicting therapeutic success or indicating relapse of the tumor. Although a significant dependency of polyamine concentrations in serum or urine to Dukes' classification, tumor localization, CEA, CA 19-9, or CA 125 did not exist, a significant linear correlation was found for tumor size."
CD011134,0,2295083,0,"Presence of villin, a tissue-specific cytoskeletal protein, in sera of patients and an initial clinical evaluation of its value for the diagnosis and follow-up of colorectal cancers.","Villin is an actin-binding protein found in a few normal adult epithelia, namely epithelial cells in the digestive and urogenital tracts. Moreover, villin production is maintained in malignant cells. We assumed that cell lysis and necrosis of solid tumors producing villin might result in villin release into blood. We analyzed the villin content of sera from 788 patients and controls using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients and controls were classified into healthy donors, patients with benign diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, patients with colorectal cancers, and patients with malignant nondigestive diseases. In the panel of sera analyzed, the sensitivity of the assay for colorectal cancers was 50.5%, and its overall specificity for malignant digestive tumors was 94.5%. Results were statistically analyzed comparing each group of sera with each other. We conclude that the presence of villin is indicative of a pathological state in the gastrointestinal tract (P less than 0.001). Finally, we followed villin levels after tumor resections (60 patients). We found that the villin level in sera remains low in remissions but is raised in recurrences. We suggest that the villin assay may have clinical utility as a diagnostic adjunct for adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract. It may also have some value in monitoring patients with advancing colorectal carcinomas after resection of these tumors."
CD011134,0,2294807,1,Postoperative surveillance of patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum.,"The early detection and management of recurrence following curative resection for colorectal carcinoma can prolong survival. However, at the present time there is no consensus on the appropriate follow-up protocol for such patients. This investigation was undertaken to determine which tests and procedures are most useful in detecting recurrence and the frequency with which they should be employed. Another purpose of this study was to identify those patients at high risk for recurrence. Sixty-five patients who underwent curative resection of adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum were followed for at least two years or until recurrence. Thirty were classified as Duke's A carcinoma of the colon, 18 were Duke's B, and 17 were Duke's C. Mean follow-up was 44.9 months. The follow-up regimen consisted of clinical exam, liver function tests, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, and chest x-ray every three months for the first two years postoperatively and every six months thereafter, and colonoscopy or barium enema and proctoscopy every six months for the first two years postoperatively and every year thereafter. Seventeen patients (26%) had a recurrence; 24% per cent of these developed within one year, 65 per cent developed within two years, 82 per cent developed within three years, and 94 per cent developed within four years of resection. Recurrence was detected by CEA in eight patients, chest x-ray in five, endoscopy in three, and laparotomy for small-bowel obstruction in one patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Initial experience and results.,"We have been using endoluminal ultrasonography since 1988 as part of the follow-up procedure after colorectal surgery. A total of 106 patients with anterior resection of the rectum or the sigmoid colon were involved in 1988. The follow-up period for these patients ranged from 1 to 56 months after surgery (23.1 +/- 15.1 months after anterior resection of the rectum; 25.7 +/- 22 months after anterior resection of the sigmoid). During the observation period 7 patients developed recurrence after anterior resection of the rectum and 5 after anterior resection of the sigmoid. The primary stages for these patients had been 7 cases of Dukes' B, 3 of Dukes' C1 and 2 of Dukes' D. Raised serum CEA levels were found in 5 cases. In 3 other cases, we found pathological changes in the anastomotic region by means of endoscopy. In these the endorectal ultrasonic scan showed hypodense masses as a sign of recurrence. In 2 of these 3 cases, the serum CEA level was normal. In 4 cases endoluminal rectal ultrasonography alone was suspicious. This led to further diagnostic procedures and finally to radical excision. All suspicious ultrasonic images were monitored 2 to 4 weeks later. In cases of suspicion, endoscopic, needle or surgical transrectal biopsies were taken from all patients. In all cases, histological analysis confirmed the ultrasonic diagnosis of local recurrence."
CD011134,0,2273952,0,[Radioimmunoscintigraphy with monoclonal antibodies in recurrences and metastases of colorectal tumors].,"An experimental follow-up plan based on immunoscintigraphy was evaluated in 48 patients, who had undergone resection for colorectal cancer. The results were compared with those concerning other 317 patients submitted to a traditional follow-up (physical examination, blood analysis, endoscopy, ultrasonography, CT scan, barium enema, etc.). Immunoscintigraphy was performed with Iodine 131--or Indium 111--labeled anti-CEA and-19.9 monoclonal antibody, using a gamma-detecting probe (GDP) enabling to perform radioimmunodetections. In addition, radioimmunoguided surgery was performed in two cases of highly suspected recurrence, and radioimmunoguided endoscopy was made in two cases of suspected recurrence after anterior resection for tumor of the rectum. Our gamma-detecting probe differs from the other ones because of its collimator which enables to detect all the radioisotopes that are used for external scanning and because of its particular shape that enables to perform endoscopic radioimmuno detections. The experimental follow-up plan showed cancer recurrence in 27% of the patients vs. 13% of extensive instrumental investigations. Radioimmunoguided surgery appears to provide a higher level of radicality. The same GDP used for intraoperative immunoscintigraphies seems to be effective in the endoscopic study of the pelvis after anterior resection, a clinical occurrence which can hardly be investigated by means of other instrumental diagnostic procedures."
CD011134,0,2271809,1,Is ultrasound superior to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) measurement in recurrent tumor screening of patients with colorectal carcinoma?,"Assuming that in the postoperative recurrent tumor screening CEA levels are as important as imaging techniques in elucidating the spread or the recurrence of a tumor, we examined 61 patients with colonic carcinoma. Those patients were operated curatively and were regularly controlled by clinical examination, laboratory, sonographic, endoscopic or radiological methods. In 3 patients there was a local recurrent, in 3 other patients there was a local recurrent and metastases. 8 patients showed sonographic livermetastases only, proved by computed tomography. In 6 patients CEA-levels rose. In 2 patients with sonographically confirmed metastases of the liver, there were neither clinical nor laboratory hints for metastases and the CEA-levels were normal. No one had elevated CEA-levels before detecting metastases. Our results indicate that ultrasound of the liver can detect metastases of colonic tumors earlier than clinical or laboratory sings do. Because of its greater diagnostic security, ultrasound is superior to CEA-measurement in recurrent tumor screening."

Differentiated use of various monoclonal antibody preparations].,"The sensitivity of immunoscintigraphy (ISC) with monoclonal antibodies (Mab) depends on the Mab type, the radiophysical properties of the isotope, the labeling method and the tumor localization. We investigated 38 studies with three different Anti-CEA Mab (In111/I131 BW 431, n = 12; I131 IMACIS-1, n = 11; Tc99m BW 431/26, n = 15) in 35 postoperative tumor patients (31 colorectal, 1 gastric, 2 breast and 1 pancreas cancer) with a total of 62 tumor manifestations. Planar ISC was used in all studies. A dual isotope technique with Tc99m-colloid was applied for imaging of liver metastases in the In111/I131 BW 431/31 and I131 IMACIS-1 studies. Whereas the global sensitivity, ranging from 64-73%, was comparable, the different physiological properties of the Mab preparations caused marked differences in the imaging capabilities of certain tumor localizations, especially in the liver. All Mab underestimated the extent of liver involvement, however, the highest regional sensitivity (75%) was found with the I131 IMACIS-1. In contrast, Mab with the highest physiological liver uptake (In111 BW 431/31, Tc99m BW 431/26) imaged liver metastases in most cases unspecifically as cold spot, yielding a sensitivity of 0-9%. No differences between the Mab were seen in the regional sensitivity with respect to lung metastases, which ranged between 33-40%. All tested Mab showed a high sensitivity in imaging local recurrences ranging between 50% for the I131 IMACIS-1 and 100% for the Tc99m BW 431/26. We conclude, that in postoperative tumor patients anti-CEA ISC with Tc99m BW 431/26 is the method of choice for the detection of local recurrences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The sensibility for primary diagnosis of each tumor marker is not very high but there is a relationship between the stage and the histological characters of the disease, especially when the markers are considered at the same time. Preoperative serum level determination of CEA and GICA can be considered a good prognostic index: infarct the increase of the levels is generally due to metastatic tissue or local recurrence.

CD011134,0,2201096,0,Flow cytometry and prognostic implications in patients with solid tumors.,"Flow cytometric DNA content analysis is a rapid, quantitative method of determining the DNA ploidy status and proliferative index of a given tumor. Abnormal DNA content, or aneuploidy, has been recognized as a marker of malignancy and is present in about 70 per cent of solid tumors. In the majority of solid tumors, the consensus is that the presence of an aneuploid tumor predicts a poorer over-all survival rate and a shorter disease-free interval, indicating that patients with diploid tumors have a more favorable prognosis than those with aneuploid tumors. The prognostic implications of an abnormal DNA content, therefore, suggest either a higher risk of relapse, a worsening of survival rate or a risk for progression of disease in stages I and II carcinoma of the breast, carcinoma of the colon and rectum, superficial carcinoma of the bladder and malignant melanoma. Thus, the assessment of cellular DNA content should be regarded as an additional prognostic determinant and should play an ancillary role in the decisions regarding the management of patients with malignant disease. With the introduction of more sophisticated technology, it will be possible to simultaneously assay for DNA ploidy and cell cycle distribution in addition to a series of tumor markers, such as CEA, and various products of oncogenes, thus providing further understanding of the heterogeneity of solid tumor cells."
CD011134,0,2201097,0,Surveillance strategies after resection of carcinoma of the colon and rectum.,"The primary aim of postoperative surveillance of patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum is to detect recurrent tumor when cure is still possible. Most recurrences are detected within 30 months after the initial operation. Patients who have had carcinoma of the colon and rectum must be observed not only because of the risk of recurrence or metastatic disease but also because of the increased risk of subsequent primary carcinomas of the colon and rectum as well as of other sites. Careful history-taking and thorough physical examination provide the first indication of tumor recurrence in as many as 48 per cent of instances. Although the liver is the most common site of metastases from carcinoma of the colon, liver chemistry tests are seldom the first to indicate recurrent disease. Fecal occult blood testing, roentgenography with barium enema and colonoscopy are useful surveillance tools, not for detecting recurrences but for detecting second primary carcinomas. Imaging techniques, such as intravenous pyelography, CT and scintigraphy of liver and spleen are generally not cost-effective in surveillance, but MRI and ultrasonography have shown some promise in detection of recurrence without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. The most effective indicator of recurrent disease is a progressive increase in serial levels of CEA. When CEA levels rise and other methods of imaging cannot account for the change, second-look operation is generally appropriate."
CD011134,0,2199223,0,Current status of immunoscintigraphy in colorectal cancer--results of 5 years' clinical experiences.,"In 100 patients with suspected colorectal cancer, findings of conventional diagnostic methods were compared with immunoscintigraphy results. In a first trial 131-J-labelled F (ab') 2-fragments against CEA and CA 19-9 were used in 42 patients. Evidence was confirmed by surgical exploration in 69% of cases and by close follow-up examination in 31%. In a second trial 58 patients were included, and 81% of these were explored surgically. Conventional diagnostic methods achieved better results in both series in imaging liver and extrahepatic tumor manifestations, and in both series immunoscintigraphy was especially disappointing with regard to extrahepatic tumor diagnosis (sensitivity 23% and 38%, respectively).

Twenty patients with a history of completely resected CEA-producing adenocarcinoma (18 with colon cancer, one with breast cancer, and one with Hodgkin's disease) and a rising serum CEA level were given an intravenous infusion of 2 mg of 111In-labeled ZCE-025 mixed with 38 mg of unlabeled ZCE-025. Planar and single-photon emission CT (SPECT) scans were acquired at 72 and 144 hours, and in 19 of the 20 patients these were positive. Of those 19, 13 underwent exploratory surgery, and cancer was found in 10, and two had a diagnostic biopsy, which confirmed cancer. Three patients who had negative laparotomies and all four patients who did not undergo surgery or biopsy were followed radiologically. In all seven, cancer was subsequently detected at the sites suggested by the ZCE-025 scan. Thus, tumor was confirmed in all 19 patients with positive scans. Five of 13 patients who were explored benefited from the study and the exploratory laparotomy, as disease was entirely resected in four or was subjected to definitive radiation therapy to the pelvis in the fifth. In two additional patients who were not explored, MoAb imaging resulted in definitive therapy to regionally confined recurrent disease. 111In-labeled anti-CEA MoAb ZCE-025 scanning in patients with rising CEA successfully imaged metastatic colorectal cancer that eluded detection by other methods and affected the care given to some. These results suggest an important role for 111In-labeled ZCE-025 scanning among patients with rising CEA and otherwise occult metastatic cancer."

Five oat cell variants, 14 intermediate variants, and two moderately differentiated tumors were studied with antibodies to cytokeratin, vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), chromogranin (CRG), synaptophysin (SYN), neurofilament, S-100 protein, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and Leu-7. All tumors were immunoreactive for cytokeratin and the majority were also positive for EMA and NSE. Positivity for specific neuroendocrine markers was uncommon, with SYN reactivity noted in one oat cell variant and four intermediate variants, and CRG positivity observed in four intermediate variants and one moderately differentiated tumor. Ultrastructural analysis of four oat cell, eight intermediate, and one moderately differentiated tumor revealed neurosecretory-type, dense-core granules in all lesions, except two oat cell variants studied from paraffin-retrieved material. Hepatic and regional lymph node metastases were noted in five of six oat cell, eight of 16 intermediate, and two of two moderately differentiated tumors. Of 17 patients with follow-up (four oat cell, 11 intermediate, and two moderately differentiated tumors), only two individuals were alive after 1 year. There were no detectable differences in survival or response to treatment between morphologic subtypes. The prognosis of colorectal neuroendocrine carcinoma appears worse than for adenocarcinoma of comparable stage. Their distinction is thus warranted, especially in regard to the intermediate variant and moderately differentiated tumors, which may be potentially misinterpreted as forms of adenocarcinoma."

In this series there was one false positive result. About one-third of all patients injected with the antibody developed a human anti-mouse response (HAMA), but no severe side effects were seen even after four applications.

Routine clinical application is restricted to colorectal carcinoma at the moment. Radioimmunoscintigraphy is recommended in case of recurring disease when conventional methods are ineffective or doubtful, especially in the pelvic region. The availability of monoclonal antibodies to new tumor-associated antigens will extend the spectrum to other gastrointestinal tumors.

Results for sensitivity and specificity in tumour sites were 94% and 87%, respectively, for the pelvis and 73% and 100% for the extrahepatic abdomen. A second prospective series concerned 58 other patients previously operated on for colorectal adenocarcinoma (27 colon, 31 rectum). Two-thirds of these patients had a suspected recurrence signalled by an isolated rise in tumour markers, and 46 patients examined by immunoscintigraphy, X-ray computed tomography and ultrasonography were found to have a recurrence (a total of 62 tumour sites). Sensitivity and specificity with immunoscintigraphy were 90% and 97%, respectively, for the pelvis and 62% and 95% for the extrahepatic abdomen. For 29 patients injected with CEA-specific fragments, sensitivity was 90% and specificity 94% for the pelvis. For 25 patients injected with 19-9 fragments, pelvic sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 100%, respectively, whereas sensitivity for the extrahepatic abdomen was only 29% since several cases of peritoneal carcinosis were not visualized. In the prospective series, comparison of the three imaging techniques for all tumour sites (including liver and in 5 cases thorax) gave a sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 91%, respectively, for immunoscintigraphy, 52% and 95% for X-ray computed tomography and 59% and 100% for ultrasonography.

Indispensable factors are the organized care and regular control of the operated patients with an emphasis, beside CEA test on US and CT studies.

Statistical analysis showed significant correlations between serum CEA, CRP, AAG, and AAT levels and the percentage of serum beta-globulins with the stage of the disease. Multivariate discriminant analysis gave a final prognostic model that included serum CEA, CRP, and AAT levels and the percentage of the serum beta-globulins with a significance of P less than 0.000001.

Tumor resection had been carried out in five recurrent tumors. Six patients presented with distant metastases. 30 to 40 Gy photons for tumor region and potential microscopic spread with 2 Gy per fraction and 5 to 10 Gy neutrons for macroscopic tumor volume with 0.7 to 1.6 Gy per fraction were applied using multiple fields (three to five). The mean follow-up period is nine months. Pain relief was achieved in eleven of 15 patients (73%), the onset of pain was fast, the probability for a pain-free period is 46% for nine months and for survival 56% for twelve months. Side-effects were slight to moderate beside a severe subcutaneous fibrosis in two patients. The superiority of neutrons to photons in rectal recurrent cancer remains questionable and is to be proven in a prospective trial comparing different schedules for frequency, onset and duration of pain relief, tumor control, survival and side-effects."
CD011134,0,10303909,0,Limitations of nonscience in surgical epistemology. The second-look laparotomy.,"Decision-making in medicine is a very complex process that demands input both from the doctor and from the client. From the doctor's point of view, the most important component for this decision concerns the quality of evidence available that the recommended intervention is the best available in terms of both cost and benefit. Good quality evidence demands good quality science. The randomized controlled trial is the expression of this scientific process at work within medical practice. This article reviews both the rationale and the ethics of randomized controlled trials in the epistemology of surgery. The ethical dilemma is accentuated because surgery by its very nature is invasive and often irreversible. As an illustration of the scientific and ethical dilemmas arising out of randomized controlled trials in surgery, a description of the CEA directed second-look laparotomy trial in the United Kingdom is provided. This trial may be judged essential because of the clash of attitudes between surgeons in the United States and the United Kingdom. It is unlikely that the truth lies entirely with one or other national groupings of surgeons, and this randomized trial will eventually resolve a conflict of ideas to the ultimate benefit of all patients with operable colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,2927234,0,[The value of tumor markers in colorectal cancer].,"In 137 patients with colorectal carcinoma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was preoperatively measured in serum. Sensitivity of CEA was dependant on the tumor stage. Patients in early tumor stages (TNM stages I + II) demonstrated only in 10% grossly elevated CEA levels compared with 43% of patients with progressive tumor stages (TNM III + IV). The main importance of tumor markers lies still in postoperative follow-up. In patients with a local recurrence of colorectal carcinoma we measured in 57% CEA levels greater than 10ng/ml, in patients with distant metastases even in 75%. CA 19-9 achieved a lower sensitivity in postoperative follow-up of colorectal carcinoma than CEA. Only 22% of patients with a recurrence of colorectal carcinoma had CA 19-9 levels beyond the normal range (37 U/ml) compared with 67% elevated CEA levels in the same group of patients. CEA is still the most important tumor marker in colorectal carcinoma. Measurement of CA 19-9 in postoperative follow-up is no substitute for CEA, it can only be a supplement."
CD011134,0,2920105,0,Implantation of colon cancer cells onto renal pelvic mucosa. A case report.,"We report here on a patient with recurrent sigmoid colon carcinoma. Postmortem examination revealed a fist-sized tumor in the retroperitoneum, invasive to the left ureter obstructing its lumen causing hydronephrosis of the ipsilateral kidney. Histological examination of the kidney showed multiple foci of adenocarcinoma cells on the pelvic surface. Invasion into the underlying tissue was not observed, and there was no tumor in the submucosal tissue of the pelvis or in the parenchyma of the left kidney. Cancer cells on the renal pelvic mucosa showed strong immunoreactivities for CEA and CA 19-9. These findings suggest that the tumor foci in the pelvis are formed by the intraluminal implantation of colon cancer cells detached from the ureteric metastasis. Our case presents the possibility of the implantation of carcinoma cells in the human urinary tract."
CD011134,0,2915539,0,Assessment of serial carcinoembryonic antigen: determinations to monitor the therapeutic progress and prognosis of metastatic liver disease treated by regional chemotherapy.,"It is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of regional chemotherapy of metastatic liver disease by means of imaging procedures. Therefore it was the aim of this study to find out whether serial carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) determinations yield reliable data on the therapeutic progress and the individual prognosis of these patients. Since there exists no generally accepted modality to assess CEA curves of patients receiving chemotherapy, we developed our own criterion and tested it in a group of 35 patients. For each patient an individual reference level (CEA-means) was fixed which was obtained as the arithmetical mean of serial CEA values taken during the first three courses of chemotherapy (reference time). On the basis of CEA-means the marker curves of the 35 patients could be divided into two groups. After the reference time the CEA values of group 1 (12 patients) never decreased below CEA-means. Survival of these patients was significantly (P = 0.00001) shorter than that of the 23 patients (group 2) who showed a decrease in their CEA curves below CEA-means after the reference time. Beyond this it could be observed that the improvement in survival was significantly greater in those patients who showed a CEA decrease below CEA-means for a prolonged period (3 months). This difference in prognosis is not an artefact due to different pretherapeutic conditions but is a sign of different responses to therapy. The decrease in CEA values below the individual reference level (CEA-means) is a certain sign of the efficacy of the chosen chemotherapy. A continuous rise of the CEA curve above CEA-means signifies an ineffective intrahepatic chemotherapy or extrahepatic tumor manifestation. In this case an intensive diagnostic workup of the patient and possibly a modification of the therapy are indicated."

A prospective study of prognostic factors.,"Regional recurrence of malignant tumors in the peritoneal cavity usually signifies a poor prognosis for the host and often results in gastrointestinal complications requiring surgical intervention. One hundred patients with nongynecological malignancies found with peritoneal carcinomatosis were followed prospectively. The most common primary tumors were colorectal (N = 45) and pancreatic (N = 20) carcinoma. When associated with pancreatic carcinoma, 65% of patients had liver metastases and 60% had ascites. The presence of ascites was associated with poor survival, with no patient surviving past 30 days. Ascites was also a sign of poor prognosis in patients with colorectal carcinoma. Among possible prognostic factors in colorectal carcinoma patients, only disease-free interval, presence of lung metastases, and ascites showed statistically significant correlations with survival. Peritoneal carcinomatosis in sarcoma (N = 7) and breast cancer (N = 6) patients had median survival of 12 and 7 months, respectively. Surgical intervention for gastrointestinal complications in peritoneal carcinomatosis can provide significant palliation, with a few exceptions such as in patients with pancreatic or gastric carcinoma, ascites, and poor performance status."

The most common site of metastasis was the liver (41%), independent of the primary location. Local/regional recurrences alone accounted for 40% of all recurrences. In six patients (18%), recurrent tumor was found only with the RIGS system. The RIGS system is more dependable in localizing clinically obscure metastases than other methods, and carcinoembryonic antigen testing remains the most accurate preoperative method to indicate suspected recurrences."

We have investigated serum levels of TAG-72 antigen in patients with gastrointestinal cancer with a solid phase radioimmunometric assay (RIA), CA72-4, utilizing murine monoclonal antibodies CC49 and B72.3 which recognize the TAG-72 antigen. Elevated levels of serum TAG-72 antigen were found in 48% of 56 gastric carcinoma patients and 67% of 45 colorectal carcinoma patients.

The positive rates of CA19-9 in gastric carcinoma and colorectal carcinoma patients were 29% and 54%, and those of CEA were 52% and 60%, respectively. Elevated serum levels of TAG-72, CA19-9 and CEA were observed in 7%, 14% and 24%, respectively, of patients with benign disease, thus indicating a preferential expression of TAG-72, compared to CA19-9 and CEA, in gastrointestinal carcinoma patients versus in patients with benign disorder. A cocktail of CA72-4, CA19-9 and CEA RIAs increased positive rates to 68% in sera of gastric cancer patients and 84% in sera of colorectal cancer patients. Combination assays using CA72-4, CEA and CA19-9 RIAs for patients with benign gastrointestinal disorder, however, also increased the positive rate to 31%. These results indicate that CA72-4, CA19-9 and CEA RIAs may be complementary in detecting circulating tumor-associated antigens.

Neither number, site and volume of the metastases, level of carcinoembryonic antigen concentration, tumour differentiation, stage or site of primary tumour, nor type of operation (enucleation or hemihepatectomy) had any influence on survival rate. Since most of the recurrences in the liver had occurred after enucleation at the site of the previous resection, it is feasible that the results could be improved by extending the area of resection."

Fifteen procedures, including six exploratory laparotomies, four transperineal explorations, two transsacral explorations, one transvaginal biopsy, one brachytherapy, and one transanal polypectomy, were performed. Two patients had previous low anterior resection, seven abdominoperineal resection, and one a rectal polypectomy. Five patients had previous pelvic radiation therapy. Reoperation was indicated by elevated CEA levels in seven patients (70 percent), persistent pelvic pain in six (60 percent), and a suspicious radiologic study in seven (70 percent). RIGS system localized tumors verified by histopatholoy in all ten patients (100 percent); one patient with a positive CT scan and probe findings lacked histopathologic confirmation on frozen section, but had a tumor confirmed on permanent histology. Five major abdominal operations were avoided; in five patients major modifications were made in the surgical procedure based on probe findings. Six received chemotherapy or radiation therapy based on findings of the RIGS system. In six patients with negative or equivocal CT scans, the RIGS system localized histopathologically confirmed tumor. Major abdominal procedures can be avoided, the surgical approach modified, and other modes of therapy instituted earlier with the use of the RIGS system."
CD011134,0,2799440,1,"Radioimmunoguided surgery in recurrent colorectal cancer: the role of carcinoembryonic antigen, computerized tomography, and physical examination.","From January 1986 to December 1987, 32 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer had second-look radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS system). All patients had pathologic confirmation of recurrence. The RIGS system identified 81% of recurrences, and in six patients recurrent tumor was identified only by RIGS. All patients had physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay, and computerized tomography of the abdomen and pelvis. Detection of recurrence was based on symptoms in six, elevated CEA value in 25, and physical examination in one. The CEA was elevated preoperatively in 30 patients; two false-negative results occurred in symptomatic patients who had pelvic recurrence. The median CEA value in those with liver recurrence was 30 ng/ml (range 5.2 to 298) and for pelvic recurrence 13 ng/ml (range 1.9 to 31) (P less than .05). The overall sensitivity of CT was 41% (abdomen other than liver 37%, liver 56%, and pelvis 22%). The combination of elevated CEA, symptoms, and physical findings identified 100% of recurrences. We conclude that a rising CEA remains the most accurate indicator of recurrence. CT should not be done routinely to detect recurrent colorectal cancer unless CEA is elevated or the patient is symptomatic.

CD011134,0,2795205,0,Clinical value of immunoscintigraphy in colorectal carcinoma patients: a prospective study.,"Fifty-seven patients with suspected CEA-producing tumors were studied prospectively by radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) using a 123I-labeled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (MAb) (essentially the F(ab')2 or Fab fragments) and emission computed tomography (ECT). Results of RIS were compared to those of a comprehensive diagnostic study. Final diagnosis was based on surgery, biopsy and autopsy (n = 39) or follow-up findings (n = 18). Three groups of patients were defined: Group A with suspected primary tumors (n = 11), Group B with probable (n = 19) and Group C with questionable (n = 27) tumor relapse. Eighty-eight per cent, 93% and 71% of the anatomic regions studied were correctly identified as being involved, and 97%, 97%, and 87% as being free from tumor in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. In the 27 patients from Group C with no definite diagnosis of relapse, and in whom diagnosis was most difficult, 38 tumor sites were involved. Of these, 21 were detected by both prospective RIS and repeated comprehensive study, six by RIS only and seven by conventional methods only. Four sites remained undetected by both approaches. Ten of the 21 lesions were detected by RIS more than 1 mo earlier than by any other method. Among the seven tumor sites detected by other diagnostic modalities only, three were identified at the time of RIS and four became positive more than 6 mo later. Overall diagnosis was entirely correct in 30, partially correct in 16 and incorrect in six patients studied. RIS with ECT and 123I-labeled anti-CEA MAb allows early detection of recurrence or metastasis of colorectal cancer. It thus contributes to reduced delay between diagnosis and treatment."
CD011134,0,2783844,0,Scar or recurrent rectal cancer. Positron emission tomography is more helpful for diagnosis than immunoscintigraphy.,"We used positron emission tomography and fludeoxyglucose F 18 to assess metabolic activity of a pelvic mass in 18 patients who had suspected recurrent rectal cancer. Computed tomography could not differentiate tumor from scar. All patients presenting increased uptake of fludeoxyglucose F 18 by the mass were proved by histologic studies to suffer from recurrent tumor. Six of seven patients with low fludeoxyglucose uptake had nonmalignant lesions. Using immunoscintigraphy in 14 patients with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels, only four of ten recurrences could be identified by increased antibody accumulation in the mass. On the other hand, two of four benign lesions were interpreted as being recurrent tumor because of high uptake. Therefore, only positron emission tomography seems to be a useful diagnostic tool in the differentiation of recurrent rectal cancer and scar by providing information about the metabolic activity of a mass."
CD011134,0,2782914,0,[Clinical evaluation of serum level of NCC-ST-439 as a new tumor marker for colorectal diseases--fluctuation of serum NCC-ST-439 in patients with colorectal cancers before and after surgery].,"Serum level of NCC-ST-439, a new tumor marker, was clinically evaluated in patients with benign and malignant colorectal diseases in comparison with serum CEA and CA 19-9. Fluctuation of serum levels of NCC-ST-439 in patients with colorectal cancers was especially studied. Serum level of NCC-ST-439 was determined by sandwich type NCC-ST-439 EIA kit, which was developed by Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., in 93 cases of primary colorectal cancers, 98 cases of recurrent colorectal cancers and 60 cases of benign colorectal diseases. Positive rate of serum NCC-ST-439 in patients with primary colorectal cancers was 8.6% in Dukes A cases, 14.3% in Dukes B cases, 37.5% in Dukes C cases and 78.9% in Dukes D cases. Positive rate in patients with recurrent colorectal cancers was 42.8%. On the other hand, false positive rate in patients with benign colorectal diseases was 5.0%, which was relatively low in comparison with serum CEA and CA 19-9. While serum NCC-ST-439 was well correlated with serum CEA and CA 19-9 in primary colorectal cancers, NCC-ST-439 value in benign colorectal diseases showed no correlation with serum CEA and CA 19-9. In patients with primary colorectal cancers, curative resection was applied for in 40 cases in which the value recovered to the normal range after resection. In contrast, all 8 cases, which received non-curative resection, showed the increase of serum NCC-ST-439 value. In cases of recurrent colorectal cancers, some cases, which responded against chemotherapy, obviously showed a decrease of NCC-ST-439 value. These facts indicated that serum level of NCC-ST-439 could monitor the clinical effects of surgical treatment, chemotherapy and radiation therapies and it could be used as a marker for colorectal cancers. In conclusion, determination of serum NCC-ST-439 value was clinically useful for the diagnosis and monitoring for patients with colorectal cancers as a new distinct tumor marker."
CD011134,0,2781236,1,The value of a follow-up programme after radical surgery for colorectal carcinoma.,"To evaluate the effectiveness of a follow-up programme after curative surgery for colorectal carcinoma, a 10-year series of 402 patients was surveyed for the detection rate of potentially curative recurrences and metachronous neoplasms. There were 120 recurrences (30%), and 100 of them (83%) were detected at scheduled check ups. Initial suspicion of recurrence was most often based on physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen assay, or sigmoidoscopy. Reoperation was undertaken in 62 patients, in 26 cases (22%) for cure. The 5-year survival was 48% after curative reoperations. Metachronous adenomas and carcinomas occurred in 38 and 11 patients, respectively, giving corresponding cumulative 5-year incidences of 13% and 3.8%. Altogether, 37 patients (9.2%) had a curative reoperation for recurrent or metachronous carcinoma, and a further 38 patients (9.5%) had adenomas removed by polypectomy. It is concluded that regular follow-up is useful for the patients, and the follow-up schedule must be planned to detect both early recurrences and metachronous neoplasms."
CD011134,0,2779050,0,[Surgical treatment of metastatic lung cancer arising from the colon and rectum].,"Ten cases of surgically resected pulmonary metastases arising from colorectal cancer were analyzed. Five year survival rate of these patients was 14%. Only one patient survived more than five years, whose primary and metastatic lesions were not so progressive without lymph node metastasis. The rate of regional lymph node metastasis was 25% and the patients with positive nodes died or had recurrence within 2 years. Serum CEA level was useful as a tumor marker and high-level of serum CEA after operation suggested remnant disease."
CD011134,0,2776795,0,Kinetic data of in-vivo labeled granulocytes in humans with a murine Tc-99m-labelled monoclonal antibody.,"Twenty-five patients were examined in vivo with 99mTc labelled monoclonal antibodies; 15 with suspected infections with an antigranulocyte antibody (BW 250/183), 10 with suspected recurrence of a colorectal carcinoma with an anti CEA antibody (BW 431/26). Both antibodies were IgG1 isotypes. In the patients with suspected infections no change of the peripheral leukocyte count could be observed after the antibody injection (1 mg, n = 9; 0.5 mg, n = 1; 0.25 mg, n = 6). In 2 patients examined with the anti CEA antibody (2 mg), a significant decrease of the peripheral leukocyte count could be observed. The recovery rate of the 99mTc antibody labelled granulocytes was calculated to be about 10%. The increase of the antibody-antigen binding was calculated to be 0.2%/min. In vivo the organ distribution curves demonstrated an increase of 99mTc activity over spleen and bone marrow of 1.1%/min, which was interpreted as antigen-antibody reactivity. The organ distribution curves of the anti granulocyte antibody over spleen and bone marrow showed typical binding characteristics to the local granulocyte epitopes. The curves over other organs showed a simple perfusion pattern. The curves of the anti CEA antibody showed a perfusion pattern over all the examined organs. A sham dialysis model in one patient with renal insufficiency undergoing regular dialysis treatment demonstrated the viability of 99mTc antibody labelled granulocytes in vivo. The kinetic patterns of the 99mTc antibody in patients with Crohn's disease were interpreted as CEA binding of the antibody in the bowel wall."

CD011134,0,2751254,0,"Xenografts from a human colon carcinoma and its metastases: establishment, characterization and differences in the pattern of carbohydrate-binding proteins.","Investigation of the pathogenesis of human colorectal carcinoma metastasis can be rendered experimentally possible by suitable human cell biological model systems. The purpose of these studies was to establish xenografts in nude mice from human colon carcinoma and from its metastasis in the same patient as an appropriate model. Surgically removed biopsy specimens from a colon adenocarcinoma (grade 3) and its local relapse two years later with metastases in the small intestine were established as xenotransplants and their growth characteristics examined. Both tissue types shared common characteristics with respect to marker expression (carcinoembryonic antigen, neuron-specific enolase, cytokeratin). The primary tumor showed remarkable development of necrotic effusion with cytotoxic activity that ceased after several passages. The profile of endogenous carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins), the receptors for cellular glycoconjugates in a recognitive protein-carbohydrate interplay with potential relevance to metastases formation, revealed differences between these two human tumor samples of identical origin, especially with respect to beta-galactoside-specific receptors. This glycobiochemical analysis employed standardized procedures. Prolonged passaging was also shown to result in profile alterations, as was similarly noted in comparison to another species. These studies may encourage the application of systems of primary tumor and its metastases in the same patient in attempts to correlate the expression of cellular characteristics with the biological and clinical behavior of human colonic tumor cells."
CD011134,0,2746136,0,A prospective study of the use of 111In-labelled monoclonal antibody against carcino-embryonic antigen in colorectal cancer and of some biological factors affecting its uptake.,"This prospective study of radioimmunoscintigraphy using 111In-labelled, C46, a monoclonal antibody against carcino embryonic antigen, CEA, was undertaken in 23 patients with colorectal cancer, 18 with primary carcinomas, 3 with recurrences and 2 with metastases. A sensitivity of 95% and an accuracy of 91% was found. New observations through the use of two administered doses of antibody and the analysis of surgical specimens showed that for the low dose of antibody (average 0.76 mg) tumour uptake was 1.14 x 10(-2)% of the injected dose per gram, whereas on the higher dose (average 4.67 mg) the average tumour uptake was 6.77% (same units) p less than 0.01. Thus a six-fold increase of antibody caused a six-fold increase in tumour uptake, but no change was seen in the tumour to mucosa ratio 4.8 +/- 0.5 (low dose) and 4.0 +/- 1.0 (high dose). A further observation was that well and moderately differentiated tumours took up about four times more than poorly differentiated tumours (p less than 0.05). It was also found that tumour free lymph nodes had a six-fold greater uptake than tumour involved nodes (p less than 0.05) confirming other work with anti-CEA monoclonal antibody. In conclusion, although biological factors influence its efficacy, 111In labelled C46 anti-CEA is a suitable radiopharmaceutical for the radioimmunoscintigraphy of colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,2743277,0,The value of immunoscintigraphy for the operative retreatment of colorectal cancer. Limitations of a new diagnostic method.,"In 42 patients with suspected recurrent colorectal cancer, results of conventional diagnostic methods were compared with those of immunoscintigraphy. In 69% of all cases, the intraoperative findings of a second-look operation served for validation, whereas in 31% close follow-up was used. Recurrent tumors were successfully localized in 83% of patients by conventional methods, whereas immunoscintigraphy was expressive in 57% of cases. Immunoscintigraphy was disappointing especially because of its low sensitivity (23%) and low predictive value (positive, 33%; negative, 37%) with regard to successful diagnosis of extrahepatic tumors compared with the results of conventional methods (77% sensitivity; positive, 94%; negative, 79%). The rate of false-positive results was relatively high with immunoscintigraphy (n = 12), 83% of which were related to extrahepatic recurrent tumors. The value of immunoscintigraphy using an immunococktail of 131-J-labeled F(ab')2 fragments of monoclonal antibodies against CEA, with Ca 19-9 as an additional diagnostic tool for early detection of recurrent colorectal cancer, must therefore be viewed critically."
CD011134,0,2736845,0,Immunoscintigraphy with indium-111 labeled monoclonal antibodies: the importance of a good display method.,"A major drawback of In-111-labeled monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) is the presence of intense liver, renal, and bone marrow nonspecific activity. This makes the display of the images hardly optimal and their visual interpretation difficult. In this study, the ""intrinsic color scale"" (which consists of selecting the limits of the color scale as the highest and the lowest pixel value of the image) was compared to a new, simple algorithm for the determination of the limits of the color scale. This algorithm was based on the count density in the iliac crest areas. OC-125 or anti-CEA In-111 MoAb F(ab')2 fragments were used in 32 patients with suspected recurrence of ovarian (19 patients) or colorectal cancer (13 patients). Final diagnosis was assessed by surgery (21 patients), biopsy (five patients), or followup (six patients). A 10-minute abdomino-pelvic anterior view was recorded two days after injection. These views are displayed using the two methods and interpreted by two observers. Using their responses in each quadrant of the pelvis, the authors calculated two ROC curves. The comparison of the ROC curves showed better performances for the new method. For example, for the same specificity (73%), the sensitivity of the new method was significantly better (78% versus 68%). This result confirmed the importance of a good methodology for displaying immunoscintigraphic images."
CD011134,0,2720584,0,The safe and effective use of postoperative radiation therapy in modified Astler Coller Stage C3 rectal cancer.,"Locoregional recurrence in patients with Stage C3 (adjacent organ invasion) rectal carcinoma approaches 100% when surgery is not followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. The advent of the intestinal sling procedure (use of an absorbable polyglycolic acid mesh to suspend the small bowel out of the pelvis) has allowed tumoricidal doses (5000 cGy) of radiation therapy to be delivered to the pelvis without incurring radiation associated small bowel injury (RASBI). This surgical technique has allowed us to readdress the question, ""what is the effectiveness of postoperative radiation therapy when tumoricidal doses can be safely administered to patients with Stage C3 rectal cancer?"" Nineteen consecutive patients with Stage C3 rectal carcinoma underwent resective procedures and simultaneous use of the intestinal sling procedure. Postoperatively, all patients underwent contrast simulation studies that documented the small bowel above the sacral promentory. Tumoricidal doses ranging from 5200 to 5800 cGy (mean, 5600 cGy) were administered in fractionated doses. No patient demonstrated obstruction, infection, nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea, or acute RASBI. There have been two locoregional recurrences in a mean follow-up period of 33 months (range, 12 to 54 months) in patients evaluated by physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, computed axial tomography (CAT) scans, endoscopy, and reoperation or autopsy (P = 0.01). There have been ten distant recurrences (eight liver, one brain, and one lung). Three patients were reoperated on to rule out recurrence at 16, 17, and 24 months. All mesh was resorbed and there were no adhesions and no recurrent tumor. When the intestinal sling procedure is used, tumoricidal doses of radiation therapy can be safely administered without incurring RASBI. Postoperative high-dose radiation therapy can suppress locoregional recurrences in Stage C3 rectal carcinomas over and above what would be expected."
CD011134,0,2714130,0,"Multivariate analysis of a tissue CEA, TPA, and CA 19.9 quantitative study in colorectal cancer patients. A preliminary finding.","Tissue CEA, TPA, and CA 19.9 concentrations from samples of surgical specimens were measured in 47 evaluable colorectal cancer patients (median follow-up, 20 months, 13 recurrences) and correlated with individual patient follow-up status. The quantitative method appeared to be sensitive, easily reproducible, and standardizable. The tissue marker concentration was analyzed by means of the multivariate discriminant analysis, to evaluate the risk of relapse in each patient; the tumor CEA (CEA T) showed the best discriminant capacity (P = .005). The relative Fisher function provided a reliable prognostic patient index, independently of other recognized prognostic factors (Dukes' stage and cellular differentiation grade). The Cox model showed a statistical significance analyzing the tumor (T) and healthy mucosa (M) CEA values (P = .001 and P = .006, respectively). The combination of these two variables allowed for identification of three classes of patients according to CEA T and M threshold values of 216 and 85 ng/mg of protein, respectively, and different disease-free curves were obtained for each group. The two-year disease-free rate was 81 percent for patients with low values of both CEA T and M, and 21.4 percent for the group with both values above these thresholds (P = .0008). In the third class (CEA T or M higher than the reported cut-off levels), the two-year disease-free rate was 65.9 percent."
CD011134,0,2708519,0,Ablation of human colon carcinoma in nude mice by 131I-labeled monoclonal anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibody F(ab')2 fragments.,"Pooled F(ab')2 fragments of three MAbs against distinct epitopes of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were used for radioimmunotherapy of nude mice bearing a subcutaneous human colon carcinoma xenograft. 9-10 d after transplantation when tumor nodules were in exponential growth, 36 mice were treated by intravenous injection of different amounts of 131I-labeled MAb F(ab')2. All 14 mice injected with a single dose of 2,200 (n = 10) or 2,800 microCi (n = 4) showed complete tumor remission. 8 of the 10 mice treated with 2,200 microCi survived in good health for 1 yr when they were killed and shown to be tumor free. Four of nine other mice treated with four fractionated doses of 400 microCi showed no tumor relapse for more than 9 mo. In contrast, all 15 mice injected with 1,600-3,000 microCi 131I-control IgG F(ab')2 showed tumor growth retardation of only 1-4 wk, and 15 of 16 mice injected with unlabeled anti-CEA MAb F(ab')2 showed unmodified tumor progression as compared with untreated mice. From tissue radioactivity distributions it was calculated that by an injection of 2,200 microCi 131I-MAb F(ab')2 a mean dose of 8,335 rad was selectively delivered to the tumor, while the tissue-absorbed radiation doses for the normal organs were: peripheral blood, 2,093; stomach, 1,668; kidney, 1,289; lung, 1,185; liver, 617; spleen, 501; small intestine, 427; large intestine, 367; bone, 337; and muscle, 198. These treatments were well tolerated since out of 19 mice with complete tumor remission only 4 required bone marrow transplantation and 17 were in good health for 6-12 mo of observation. The results demonstrate the selective destruction of established human colon carcinoma transplants by intravenous injection of either single or fractionated doses of 131I-MAb F(ab')2."
CD011134,0,2697474,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen: function in metastasis by human colorectal carcinoma.,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a glycoprotein that has been useful as a tumor marker to predict recurrence in gastrointestinal malignancies, but whose biological function has not been elucidated.

This review examines the role that CEA plays in the development of metastases by colorectal carcinoma."
CD011134,0,2694905,0,[The value of tumor markers in digestive oncology].,"Over the last few years, many tumor markers have been proposed to clinicians but only a limited number of them meet the necessary criteria to be useful for either screening, diagnosis, prognosis or follow-up of gastrointestinal (GI) tumors. Both CEA and Ca 19-9 have proven to be clinically useful for the detection of recurrent tumors. AFP remains the most useful marker for the follow-up of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its interest for the early detection of primary tumor is debated. Recent data suggest that assays based on monoclonal antibodies to AFP could be used for detection HCC in high risk populations. Decarboxy-prothrombin assay may be a complement to the AFP test in this localization. In addition to GI hormones, serotonin and urinary 5HIAA, Neuron Specific Enolase appears to be a valuable marker for the follow-up of neuroendocrine tumors of the GI tract. Only a few of the new tumor-associated antigens detected by monoclonal antibodies, appear to be promising clinical ly e.g. Ca50 TAG-72, PAO. Monoclonal antibodies to tumor-associated markers have also been used with other techniques: Immunohistochemistry: this technique is useful to the pathologist for the diagnosis of undifferentiated tumors by demonstrating the presence of specific antigens on tissue samples. Immunoscintigraphy: it can be useful for the detection of either metastases of recurrences of colorectal cancer by using anti-ACE antibodies labeled with Iodine 131 iodine 123 or indium 111. However immunoscintigraphy is less sensitive than both ultrasonography and CT scan for localizing hepatic metastases. At the present time the best indication of this method remains the diagnosis of pelvic recurrences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Twenty nine recurrences were detected between 8 and 38 months after primary surgery. CEA, TPA and CA 19-9 showed a sensitivity of 72%, 62% and 38%, and a specificity of 78%, 86% and 97%, respectively. Of eight recurrences in which CEA was not raised, five induced a rise in TPA and two a rise in CA 19-9. The rise in the serum concentration of one of the three markers was the first sign of relapse in 23 (79%) patients. Two second-look laparotomies based solely on a rise in serum markers were performed. In one case diffuse recurrent disease was found, and in the other a resectable solitary hepatic metastasis was found."
CD011134,0,2685692,0,[Successful immunoscintigraphic tumor detection with technetium 99m marked monoclonal anti-CEA antibodies].,"Twenty patients aged 32-76 years (median 56 years) with various primary cancers or tumor recurrences (colorectal n = 14; lung, breast, medullary thyroid carcinoma n = 2, each) were studied with a technetium-99m labeled anti-CEA antibody. Intact monoclonal antibody BW 431/26 (Scintimum CEA-Tc-99m, Behringwerke AG, Marburg) was successfully labeled (Schwarz Method) by an instant 2-vial kit (labeling efficiency greater than 95% (TLC, HPLC), preserved immunoreactivity). The most frequent clinical indications were (1) the detection of tumor recurrences in patients with a steadily increasing serum CEA level (at a mean 2.3 years after complete removal of the primary tumor) but normal findings by conventional imaging modalities, (2) the search for extrahepatic tumor involvement in patients with known liver metastases scheduled for regional chemotherapy. Gamma camera scintigrams (planar and ECT) were performed 6-12 h and 18-26 h postinjection yielding a sensitivity of 95% (positive tumor contrast in 19/20 patients) with a specificity of 90% (positive predictive value 95%). Immunoscintigraphy successfully depicted tumor recurrences in 4/6 patients with elevated serum CEA values where all conventional imaging modalities had failed. The successful labeling of monoclonal antibodies with 99mTc represent an important step in clinical progress for the more practically orientated use of immunoscintigraphy and also opens new diagnostic fields."

In 69% of all cases the intraoperative findings of a second-look operation served for validation, in 31% the follow-up was controlled. Localization of recurrent tumors was successful in 83% using conventional methods versus 57% by immunoscintigraphy. This procedure disappointed especially by a low sensitivity (23%) and low predictive parameters (pos.: 33%; neg.: 37%) in regard to diagnosis of extrahepatic tumors compared to results of conventional methods (77%), 94% respectively 79%). The quote of false positive results was surprisingly high in immunoscintigraphy (n = 12), 83% of these especially in localization of extrahepatic tumors. Therefore, the validity of immunoscintigraphy as an additive diagnostic tool for early detection of recurrent colorectal cancer must be regarded critically."
CD011134,0,2683153,0,Prospective monitoring trial for carcinoma of colon and rectum after surgical resection.,"In 1978, a prospective program was initiated to evaluate postoperative monitoring of patients after resection of carcinoma of the colon and rectum. The program included clinical examination, interval endoscopy, measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), selected liver function tests (alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase) and roentgenologic testing: roentgenograms of the chest, barium enema, intravenous pyelogram (IVP) and computerized axial tomographic (CAT) scan. Of the initial 226 patients enrolled, 179 had at least one abnormal elevation of the CEA level, and in 70 (39 per cent), recurrence developed. Of the 70 with recurrence, 62 (89 per cent) had elevated CEA levels (greater than 3.0 nanograms per milliliter) prior to detection of recurrence by other means. Eight patients had normal levels (two were false-negative and the other six were tested at inappropriate times). Although other test results often complemented CEA, they were generally less sensitive for early detection. Selective use of these tests frequently documented site and extent of recurrence. The detection sensitivity of these other tests was highest with CAT scan (83 per cent), followed by barium enema and endoscopy (56 and 46 per cent). Forty-five patients underwent re-exploration. Recurrence was found in 42, of whom 23 had resectable disease (five of 11, liver; 17 of 24, local or pelvis, and one of one, lung). In three patients, nothing abnormal was found at exploration; two of these patients ultimately had metastases develop. The median survival time was 43 months and the estimated five year survival rate was 38 per cent. CEA is the best over-all indicator of early recurrence and frequent testing at short intervals is most important. Periodic clinical examination and selected other studies are also essential for early documentation of recurrence. Second-look surgical procedures appear beneficial for survival time in selected patients."

The results of IS were compared blind with those of computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US). The final diagnosis of recurrence and(or) metastasis was done in 16 cases by second-look surgery and in another patient by rectal biopsy. Overall per-patient sensitivity for the pelvis and extrahepatic abdomen was 69% for IS and 31% and 25% respectively for computed tomography and ultrasonography. No false positive of IS, as well as US and CT, for the pelvis and the extrahepatic abdomen was seen. Based on the number of anatomical sites tested, sensitivity of IS was 91% in the pelvis. In our series, scintigraphic computer subtraction did not allow adequate resolution of the problem of intense liver uptake of 111In-labeled MoAbs. It is concluded that IS using 111In-labeled anti CEA and(or) 19-9 MoAbs should be carried out prospectively in patients at high risk of recurrence of colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,2667448,0,Tumour markers in pancreatic cancer.,"Patients with pancreatic cancer usually lack signs and symptoms in the early course of the disease. Even when malignancy is suspected, differential diagnosis between benign and malignant pancreatic disorders may be difficult with current methods. An increasing interest has been focused on the utility of immunological tumour markers. CEA has been widely used since the early seventies, but the results in diagnosis of pancreatic cancer have been disappointing. Tumour marker tests for CA 19-9 and CA 50 are based on monoclonal antibodies to colonic carcinoma cell lines. CA 19-9 and CA 50 are strongly expressed in most tissue specimens from pancreatic carcinomas, but are also found in normal pancreas and benign pancreatic diseases. The CA 19-9 and CA 50 antigens are shed or released into the circulation, and are found in increased concentrations in 70-80% of patients with pancreatic cancer. Also 50-65% of patients with small resectable carcinomas have elevated CA 19-9 and CA 50 levels, although very high serum concentrations usually indicate advanced disease. Slightly elevated serum CA 19-9 and CA 50 levels are seen in some patients with benign pancreatic diseases, more often in acute than in chronic pancreatitis. Elevated values are often observed in patients with benign obstruction of the common bile duct, particularly in patients with cholangitis. In patients with jaundice of hepatocellular origin, the CA 19-9 and CA 50 levels are lower than in extrahepatic cholestasis. CA 19-9 and CA 50 have better diagnostic accuracy for pancreatic cancer than CEA, CA 125, DU-PAN-2, TPA and PSTI/TATI. However, the sensitivities and specificities of CA 19-9 and CA 50 are too low for screening of an asymptomatic population. Nevertheless, CA 19-9 and CA 50 have in our experience shown to be useful complements to other diagnostic methods in symptomatic patients with suspicion of pancreatic cancer. Combinations of different markers improve the sensitivity only slightly compared to the use of CA 19-9 or CA 50 alone. Follow-up using CA 19-9 and CA 50 is a simple and sensitive way of monitoring the postoperative course of patients with pancreatic cancer, and may give a lead time of several months for a recurrence compared to conventional methods."

CD011134,0,2667189,0,[Is the measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen still indicated in digestive cancers?].,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is not useful for detecting asymptomatic cancer. Its sensitivity and specificity are not high. For some cancers, antigen levels at the time of diagnosis provide more precise prognosis than staging alone. Regular determination of CEA is useful as a method of surveillance after surgery for cancer in the colon and in the rectum. Unfortunately the clinical gain of detecting postoperative relapses is low since curative surgical treatment is usually impossible."
CD011134,0,2662074,0,99Tcm-labelled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody for tumour immunoscintigraphy: first clinical results.,"Twenty patients with malignant carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-producing tumour recurrences (colorectal n = 14; breast, lung, medullary thyroid carcinoma n = 2, each) were studied by immunoscintigraphy using an intact monoclonal anti-CEA antibody (BW 431/26) labelled with 99Tcm by a new labelling technique (Schwarz Method). This novel approach allows an almost quantitative labelling of the antibody, which is first reduced using a thiol, lyophilized in purified form, and then reacted with a stannous salt component before 99Tcm-pertechnetate binding. The labelling efficiency (as controlled by TLC) was greater than 95%, the in vitro stability at least 6 h. The imaging results (planar and SPECT) yielded a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 87% and a diagnostic accuracy of 90%. These first promising clinical results trigger the hope that the successful labelling of monoclonal antibodies with 99Tcm is a decisive step towards the more practically orientated use of tumour immunoscintigraphy."
CD011134,0,2658821,0,[Clinical evaluation of second-look operations in colorectal cancer].,"The second look operation (SLO) for early detection of recurrent tumor is indicated rarely because of the advance in diagnostic techniques such as imaging radiology, tumor marker serology and colonofiberscopy. The SLO was performed in 21 out of 362 curative cases of colorectal cancer resected in our department; 13 for re-elevation of plasma CEA level (Group 1), 6 for unclear symptoms or signs (Group 2) and 2 for postchemotherapy or postirradiation (Group 3). Liver metastases were found in four cases in group 1 and two in group 2. Nothing was found in three cases in group 1 and two in group 2. In group 3 the radical operation was carried out in all cases following SLO with good survival results. In group 1 and 2 the excisional rate of liver metastases in 57%, its salvage rate 75%, and the excisional rate of the lymph nodes is 50%, with a salvage rate of 100%. The SLO today is indicated for cases of asymptomatic re-elevation of CEA titer, for cases of undeterminable signs or for cases of postchemotherapeutic or postirradiation improvement."
CD011134,0,2649397,0,Monoclonal antibody and cytological detection of free malignant cells in the peritoneal cavity during resection of colorectal cancer--can monoclonal antibodies do better?,"Detection of free malignant cells in the peritoneal cavity following curative resections of colorectal cancer may explain why some patients develop local or peritoneal recurrence after favourable operations. We have examined the incidence of peritoneal malignant cells using standard cytological methods and by indirect immunoperoxidase staining using monoclonal antibodies (CEA L11/285/14 and HMFG 1 and 2) in 30 patients having resection for colorectal cancer. Peritoneal washings were collected on opening the peritoneal cavity and immediately prior to closing the abdominal wall following resection. Abnormal cells were only demonstrated in 10 patients. Cytology revealed abnormal cells in seven patients (three preresection and three postresection, one patient had pre- and postresection positive cytology). Monoclonal antibody staining revealed abnormal cells in seven patients (two preresection and four postresection, one patient had both pre- and postresection positive stains). Only two patients had identical results using cytology and antibody staining. Seven of these 10 patients had hepatic metastases. The correlation between the assessment of free malignant cells using cytology and monoclonal antibody staining is poor. Long-term follow-up is required to see if 'free cells' have prognostic significance."

In patients with primary colo-rectal cancer, the serum CEA level was 15.0 +/- 52.1 ng/ml and 37.9% of patients gave a CEA level greater than 5 ng/ml. In recurrent colo-rectal cancer patients, serum CEA increased to 124.2 +/- 454.8 ng/ml with a positive rate of 78.0%. Both the CEA value and the positive rate of patients in clinically tumor-free period after surgery were 2.9 +/- 2.2 ng/ml and 16.5%, respectively. Serial follow-up CEA assays in selected cases were helpful to reflect the clinical status. Generally, CEA is useful to predict prognosis and to guide follow-up management."

The kinetic data revealed a long whole body retention of the label (62% after 4 days) and a rapid blood clearance (77% within 24 h, 89% within 48 h) leading to an early positive tumour contrast 24 h p.i. and optimal scintigrams 48 h p.i. Diagnostic results were promising in local recurrences of colorectal cancer (8/10 positive = 80%) though false positive findings in patients with inflammatory bowel disease occurred probably due to cross-reaction with a human granulocyte antigen. Liver metastases and tumours neighbouring liver and spleen were often missed (10/27 = 37%) because of high nonspecific uptake in these organs. Thus BW 431/31 proved to be a suitable compound for radioimmunodetection, however, further improvements to optimize tumour affinity and specificity of the antibody are mandatory."
CD011134,0,2602902,0,99mTc-labeled monoclonal anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibody (BW 431/26). Clinical results in the detection of colorectal carcinomas and recurrences.,"With the introduction of 99mTc-labeled monoclonal antibodies against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) a clinically relevant extension can be expected in the diagnosis of colorectal tumors by immunoscintigraphy (IS). This study comprises a total of 49 patients (primary colorectal tumors, occult neoplasms, and suspicious recurrences), in whom IS with 99mTc monoclonal antibody (MAb) BW 431/26 was performed. After injection of 1100 MBq 99mTc MAb BW 431/26 a whole-body scan was performed in anterior and posterior projection 5 1/2 h later, and SPECT of the abdominal region was done after 6 and 24 h. In the course of primary tumor identification (n = 20) all coloscopically diagnosed and operatively verified carcinomas were confirmed and correctly localized by IS (n = 11). In three patients with positive IS and suspicious coloscopic findings surgery was refused by patients and relatives. In five cases IS was true negative and in 1 case false positive. In the diagnosis of recurrences (n = 29) IS showed an uptake in computer-tomographically and coloscopically suspicious areas in 17 cases. In 12 cases IS was rated negative (11 true-negative findings in scar and granulation tissue, 1 false-negative finding in para-aortal lymph nodes). Elevated serum CEA levels were found only in 17 of 31 patients with true-positive IS. In postoperative cancer care IS with 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA antibody plays a preeminent role in the exclusion or identification of colorectal recurrences."
CD011134,0,2582433,0,Metastatic potential of human colorectal carcinomas implanted into nude mice: prediction of clinical outcome in patients operated upon for cure.,"To determine whether the production of experimental hepatic metastases in athymic nude mice by human colorectal carcinomas (HCC) correlated with the clinical outcome in patients, we harvested colorectal carcinomas from 82 patients, dissociated the tumors with collagenase and DNase, and injected them into groups of nude mice, either in the flank to assess experimental tumorigenicity or into the spleen to produce experimental metastasis in the liver. Growth in mice was then associated with clinicopathological factors and clinical outcome. Growth of HCC in either the flanks or the livers of nude mice was associated with the time to recurrence in a Wilcoxon analysis. Analysis of the outcome data in a Cox proportional hazards model suggested that there was an interaction between tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of HCC in nude mice and serum CEA concentration in the patient and stage of disease. A univariate analysis indicated that both tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of HCC in nude mice were significantly associated with the serum CEA concentration of the patient but not with the other variables of stage of disease, mucin production, local tissue invasion, state of differentiation, or sex. A subset of 57 patients was operated upon for cure and followed prospectively for up to 61 months. Tumorigenicity and, to a lesser extent, experimental metastatic potential were associated with disease recurrence in 23 of these patients. Seventy-eight % of the subset of patients who were operated upon for cure developed liver metastasis as one site of their progressive disease. Thus, the ability of HCC cells isolated from surgical specimens to grow in athymic nude mice correlates with the development of advanced disease in patients."

CEA and CA-19.9 markers were used. The antibodies were labelled with 131I, using for the scintigraphy 99mTc as well. Eighty eight metastatic foci were detected, 67 of them (76.1 per cent) confirmed by the surgeon: Of 55 pelvic localizations, surgically detected were 47 (85.5 per cent), of 24 in the abdominal cavity 15 (62.5 per cent) were confirmed and of 9 in the liver--only 5 (55 per cent). Radioimmunoassay more accurate in pelvic localizations, whereas echography and computer tomography were more precise in liver examination (83.3 per cent)."
CD011134,0,2549882,0,[Clinical significance of serum NCC-ST 439 as a tumor marker for colorectal cancer].,"Clinical significance of preoperative serum NCC-ST 439 level was studied in 119 cases of colorectal cancer (90 of primary, 29 cases of recurrent). The positive rates for serum NCC-ST 439 were 28.9% in primary and 65.5% in recurrent cases. The false positive rates for benign disease were 5.6%. These rates were low when compared with those for other tumor markers. The positive rates for serum NCC-ST 439 exhibited a strong correlation with wall invasion, lymph node and liver metastases. A combination assay of NCC-ST 439, CEA and CA 19-9 produced a high positive rates as 43.3% in primary and 86.2% in recurrent cases. These results demonstrate that measurement of serum NCC-ST 439 may be useful for cancer staging and improves the diagnostic rate in combination with CEA and CA 19-9."
CD011134,0,2537129,0,Paget's disease of the anus: a clinicopathological study.,"Paget's disease of the anus is a rare disorder of controversial origin and is frequently associated with malignancy. We studied eight patients and carried out immunohistochemical studies to determine whether particular functional profiles might be indicators of a malignant association. One patient presented with synchronous carcinoma and two developed carcinomas 3 and 10 years after excision of Paget's disease. Five patients underwent wide local excision and have not developed cancer (median follow-up 6 years, range 5-13 years). However, four patients developed recurrent Paget's disease. Immunohistochemical studies showed that in general Paget cells stained positively with CAM 5.2 (a cytokeratin marker), gross cystic disease fluid protein (a marker for apocrine cells), human milk fat globule glycoprotein (HMFG 1 and 2) and carcinoembryonic antigen but negatively for PR3A5 (a marker for colonic goblet cells). Three cases had a staining profile which was quite different from that usually observed and these were associated with malignancy. One showed an antigenic profile more typical of a large bowel carcinoma. Paget's disease of the anus appears to run one of two clinical courses: to develop malignancy; or to recur locally, often on repeated occasions. Wide local excision is the treatment of choice but long-term follow-up is necessary because of the cancer risk. An immunohistochemical staining pattern which is different from usual may indicate a higher malignant risk and/or identify some cases of Paget's disease as representing a downward 'pagetoid' extension from a anorectal adenocarcinoma rather than a true epidermotropic apocrine neoplasm of the perianal skin."
CD011134,0,2531992,0,Prevention of extrahepatic disease during intraarterial floxuridine of colorectal liver metastases by simultaneous systemic 5-fluorouracil treatment? A prospective multicenter study.,"Fifty-two (52) patients with nonresectable hepatic-only metastases from colorectal carcinoma (tumor volume less than 75%) were treated by intraarterial FUdR, 0.2 mg/kg/d x 14 days/month (IA) using implantable pumps (Infusaid). They were randomized either for IA or for IA + systemic 5-FU 700 mg/m2/d x 3 days/month (IA/IV). Forty-six (46) patients were evaluable (26 IA; 20 IA/IV). Both groups were comparable in respect to primary tumor stage, age, liver function tests, tumor markers and extent of tumor infiltration. Twenty-six (26) patients (56%) demonstrated a complete (CR) or partial response (PR) with at least a 50% decrease in CEA levels and a significant tumor volume reduction (IA 50%; IA/IV 65%). Quality of response was significantly correlated with median survival (MS) time of 25 months for CR and PR. Approximate MS for IA and IA/IV was 16 and 19.5 months, respectively, and approximate median survival time to extra- and/or intrahepatic progression was 9 months (IA) and 11 months (IA/IV). Incidence of extrahepatic recurrence was not influenced by any treatment (IA 62%; IA/IV 60%). Overall approximate median time to occurrence of extrahepatic disease was 12.5 months (IA 13; IA/IV 10). Liver disease progression was observed in 38 patients (IA 85%; IA/IV 80%). A median time of 8 months to diagnosis of liver disease progression was calculated for IA, and IA/IV was 11.5 months. Incidence of chemical hepatitis for IA and IA/IV was 54 and 45%, while biliary sclerosis occurred in 15% and 10% of the cases, respectively, and did not correlate with response rates. Systemic side effects (25%) were only observed in the IA/IV group and induced significantly more interruptions of therapy than in the IA group. It is concluded from this study that additional systemic 5-FU treatment does not prevent the occurrence of extrahepatic disease under local chemotherapy of the liver."
CD011134,0,2525415,0,Regional chemotherapy for hepatic metastases of colorectal carcinoma (continuous intraarterial versus continuous intraarterial/intravenous therapy). Results of a controlled clinical trial.,"Sixty-four patients with a biopsy diagnosis of colorectal cancer with liver metastases were treated with 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) infusions. In a pilot study, the first 20 patients were given hepatic artery infusions of FUDR by implanted pumps. The remaining 44 patients were then randomized prospectively to compare the effectiveness of continuous hepatic artery and intravenous infusion of FUDR (IA/IV group; 21 patients) with hepatic artery infusion alone (IA group; 23 patients). A continuous 14-day infusion regimen of FUDR was applied each month. The dosage was 0.2 mg/kg/d of FUDR for the IA group and 0.3 mg/kg/d for the IA/IV group. The complete and partial response rates were each 50% in the pilot study and 52% and 48% in the IA and IA/IV randomized groups, respectively. Drug toxicities in the 64 patients included gastroenteritis (21%), chemical hepatitis (57%), and biliary sclerosis (25%). There was no difference in the toxicity of FUDR in the two randomized groups (P greater than 0.1). Extrahepatic spread of cancer during therapy was found in 61% (n = 14) of the IA group and 33% (n = 7) of the IA/IV group. There was no difference in survival between the randomized groups. The 64 patients were categorized into the following two groups according to their response to therapy: (1) responders (patients with complete or partial remission [n = 32]) or nonresponders (patients with stable disease or progression of metastases [n = 32]). The median survival time was 31 months for responders and 16 months for nonresponders (P less than 0.0001). Intraarterial FUDR infusion provided control of liver metastases. The combination of intraarterial and intravenous therapy seemed to prevent extrahepatic spread during therapy in most of the patients. Survival appeared to be significantly prolonged in patients with a regression of metastases."
CD011134,0,2525005,0,[Two cases of gastrointestinal cancers with major responses to sequential methotrexate 5-FU plus 5'-DFUR].,"We reported 2 patients treated with Methotrexate (MTX)-Fluorouracil (5-FU) sequential therapy combined with Doxifluridine (5'-DFUR). The method of administration was as follows: MTX 60 mg was given intravenously (iv) followed by 5-FU 600 mg iv 2 hours later in colon cancer and 5 hours later in gastric cancer. Leucovorin 20 mg was administered 3 times every 6 hours beginning 6 hours after 5-FU infusion. This cycle was repeated once a week for 5 weeks. 5'-DFUR 1,200 mg was given orally daily and continued after MTX.5-FU therapy. Patient 1 was a 60-yr-old female with recurrent colon cancer developed four years after sigmoidectomy. She was referred to our hospital for further examinations of elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The enlarged intraabdominal lymph nodes due to recurrence were demonstrated on computer tomography and the chemotherapy was performed as described above. The swelling of lymph nodes showed marked reduction in size and CEA value was normalized. Patient 2 was a 59-yr-old man with advanced gastric cancer accompanied by giant liver metastasis. Both primary and metastatic lesion responded favorably to this regimen. There was no remarkable side effect in either patient. These results suggest that this method is worth performing in further clinical trials for cancer patients."
CD011134,0,2518432,0,[Validity and limitations of the CEA test in the treatment of colorectal carcinoma].,"CEA appears to be a good marker in the follow up of patients operated for colorectal cancer. The Authors analyse, on the base of literature data, the results of CEA test in their experience of colorectal cancers operated from 1978 to 1987. They confirm the importance of CEA as recurrence marker, however the test, by itself, is not sufficient to always identify a new onset of the disease."
CD011134,0,2488519,1,[Colorectal cancer: follow-up after curative resection].,"From Jan 1978 to Dec 1984, 128 patients had a curative resection of colorectal carcinoma. A program for early detection and surgical correction of recurrences was initiated in 88 patients with a mean age of 61 years (range 24 to 85). Seventy two patients complied with the program involving clinical examination, chest X-ray, alkaline phosphatase and CEA determinations and endoscopy at 6 month intervals. Mean follow up was 36 months (range 6 to 60). A total of 28 recurrences (32%) were detected: 4 local, 17 distant and 7 local and distant. Recurrences occurred in 46% of grade C, 19% of grade B and 0% of grade A lesions. Sixty eight% of recurrences were detected within 12 months and 93% within 36 months after surgery. Recurrences were detected by clinical examination in 71% of cases. CEA determination was sensitive (81% and specific (92%) for detection of recurrences in the remaining patients. Four patients (14%) were reoperated on with a survival of 3 to 26 months, all dying from disseminated disease. We conclude that this program did not help to improve the 5 year survival rate of colorectal carcinoma submitted to curative resection. CEA determination may be indicated at 2 month intervals during the period of increased recurrence risk."
CD011134,0,2486018,0,Immunoscintigraphy of primary and metastatic colorectal cancers with radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies anti-CEA.,"Thirteen patients with a diagnosis of primary colorectal tumour and 68 patients previously operated for colon cancer underwent an immunoscintigraphy carried out with monoclonal antibodies anti-CEA F(ab')2, labelled with 131I or 111In. These studies led to the detection of all primary tumours and of most of their associated lesions (7/8). In this group 15 neoplastic deposits previously undetected were demonstrated, allowing an improvement in the patient staging before the operation. In the group of the 68 operated patients, immunoscintigraphy succeeded in imaging 96 out of 121 known lesions: the best outcomes were obtained for abdominal and pelvic recurrences as well as for lymph nodes lesions. The lowest levels of sensitivity were observed for liver metastases. An enhancement of the immunoscintigraphy sensitivity was obtained when the radiopharmaceutical was injected intraperitoneally. In 50 patients, this alternative administration route was successful in detecting 91/107 cancer deposits and, in particular, liver metastases were found out in 36/42 cases."
CD011134,0,2481485,0,Enhanced recognition of human colorectal tumour cells using combinations of monoclonal antibodies.,"Murine monoclonal antibodies directed against tumour associated antigens are potentially useful in tumour diagnosis and therapy. However, all the antigens they recognise may be heterogeneously expressed on tumours and this may allow escape of cells from therapy if a single monoclonal antibody is used. One approach is to use combinations of monoclonal antibodies recognising complementary cell surface antigens. A flow cytometric method which allows accurate quantitation of the intensity of staining and the percentage of fresh primary tumour cells binding a series of monoclonal antibodies has therefore been developed. This allows calculations as the number of drug molecules which could be potentially delivered by each monoclonal antibody and the optimal combination of antibodies which should be used. Monoclonal antibodies recognising Y hapten (C14), CEA (228, 161) and 791T-p72 antigen (791T/36) have been screened as a possible combination for colorectal cancer. There was inter-tumour variation in the binding of all the monoclonal antibodies although combinations could reduce or abrogate this problem. A combination of the monoclonal antibodies C14, 228, 791T/36 and 161 would recognise 100% of tumours. Sixty per cent of tumours bound all four antibodies, 78% any three, 90% any two and 100% any one antibody. There was also intra-tumour variation in the number of tumour cells per lesion that were recognised, the best monoclonal antibody, 161, stained a mean of 59% of cells per tumour whereas the anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibody stained a mean of 74% of cells per tumour. An increased intensity of staining of tumour membranes was observed when a combination of C14 and 228 was used compared to binding of individual antibodies. Furthermore there was still no significant binding to normal colon membranes. Combinations of monoclonal antibodies which recognise a high percentage of tumours are likely to be necessary for monoclonal antibody drug targeting to prevent tumour recurrence and/or metastases."

Assays of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a separate diagnostic procedure proved inadequate due to their low sensitivity (42.1%). Since the effectiveness of ultrasonography application in diagnosing rectal cancer was as high as 91%, it should be recommended for follow-up of radically operated patients."
CD011134,0,2471456,0,[Clinical evaluation of second-look operations in colorectal cancer].,"Second look operations in colorectal cancer after curative resection were undertaken for liver metastasis or local recurrence. In our 247 curative cases, 35 were operated for liver metastasis and 18 for local recurrence. In 35 cases of liver metastasis, 25 had local disease amenable to resection and one had palliative resection. Among 21 pelvic recurrences, 11 had curative re-resection and 2 had palliative resection. The survivors generally experienced relief from various clinical distress, and most of those previously employed could return to work. The actual 3-year survival rate is 51.9% in the group of resected liver metastasis, and 9 of 13 cases resected for local recurrence are alive without evidence of re-recurrence. In conclusion, selected patients with recurrence may recover and resume ordinary living with the second look operation."
CD011134,0,2471180,0,Measuring of immunoreactivity of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in colorectal cancer by microdensitometry.,"In 32 patients with colorectal carcinomas, the immunoreactivity of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was measured on section preparations of the tumours by means of a computer controlled microdensitometric method. By measuring numerous single points, the intensity of the immunohistochemical staining reaction of CEA was evaluated. This method is superior to the commonly used semiquantitative method (+, ++, ) for the assessment of various degrees of staining intensity whenever the antigen to be measured is not homogeneously dispersed in the tissue. The results show that highly differentiated colorectal carcinomas of stage A according to Dukes classification have a lower CEA immunoreactivity than highly differentiated carcinomas of stage B. A correlation between CEA immunoreactivity and degree of malignancy could only be found in patients in stage B. Stage C carcinomas of all degrees of differentiation appeared with a very low CEA immunoreactivity. CEA follow-up controls in our study were of little value for detecting local recurrences; metastases, however, almost always caused an increase in serum CEA titers. Prognostically, a preoperatively increased serum CEA level seems to be as unfavourable as a low CEA immunoreactivity in the tumour."
CD011134,0,2468779,0,Flow cytometric screening of monoclonal antibodies for drug or toxin targeting to human cancer.,"Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that are candidates for antibody-directed therapy were evaluated by a flow cytometric method. This method accurately quantitates the intensity of staining and the percentage of cells from freshly derived primary tumors expressing the relevant cell surface antigens. This method was applied to human colorectal, gastric, and ovarian carcinomas. It allowed calculations of the number of drug molecules that potentially could be delivered by each MAb as well as selection of the optimal combinations of antibodies for treatment of each type of cancer. The binding of all the MAbs varied among the tumors, although combinations of antibodies reduced this problem. A combination of MAbs C14 and NCRC-23 recognized 97% of colorectal tumors. A combination of C14, NCRC-23, and 791T/36 recognized 95% of gastric tumors. Combinations of either 791T/36 and C14 or 791T/36 and NCRC-11 recognized 80% of ovarian tumors. The number of cells binding with a single MAb varied within the tumor. The optimal anti-colorectal tumor antibody was NCRC-23 (anti-carcinoembryonic antigen), which recognized a mean of 65% of the large cells within a tumor at a mean antigen density of 4.9 X 10(5) sites/cell. The optimal anti-gastric tumor antibody was C14 (anti-Y hapten), which recognized a mean of 66% of the large cells within a tumor at a mean antigen density of 4.4 X 10(5) sites/cell. The optimal anti-ovarian antibody was 115/D8, which recognized 54% of the large cells at a mean antigen density of 4.2 X 10(5) sites/cell. These antigen densities were similar to those calculated for HLA/ABC antigens in colorectal and ovarian cancers. However, the gastric tumors expressed elevated levels of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens, with a mean density of 7.3 X 10(5) sites/cell. Combinations of antibodies that recognize a high proportion of tumor cells are likely to be necessary for MAb-drug targeting to prevent tumor recurrence and/or metastases."
CD011134,0,3418082,0,Postoperative follow-up for colorectal cancer: who are we kidding?,"The results of treatment of colorectal cancer have improved little over the last 40 years. This reflects both the advanced age of the patients and the advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis. Currently, extensive multimodality, periodic evaluation of patients is advocated following potentially curative resections in the hope that colorectal cancer recurrence will be identified when metastases are isolated and curable. Such efforts, however, have failed to make any substantial impact on survival. At this time, the identification of colorectal cancer at an earlier than usual stage appears to be the only means by which survival can be improved. Despite this, substantially more effort and resources are devoted to the postoperative follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer than to the identification of early curable colorectal cancer. In the current economic climate and with limited medical resources, it may be more appropriate to aim primarily at identifying early curable lesions by more routine colonscopy."

Twenty-two patients had tumor recurrence; 13 patients had only inflammatory changes or radiation fibrosis. At a single examination of each patient (with no reference to prior baseline studies), MR imaging was more accurate than CT, largely because MR imaging was more successful in the distinction of recurrence from fibrosis based on the differences in signal intensity on T2-weighted images."

CD011134,0,3366023,0,Regression analysis of prognostic factors in colorectal cancer after curative resections.,"The clinical, laboratory, and pathologic data of 310 patients who had curative resections were prospectively collected and analyzed in a multiple stepwise regression model. Although several factors (i.e., venous invasion) were of importance in univariate analysis, the following conclusions reflect the outcome and relative importance of the regression analysis only. Blood loss as an initial symptom and duration of symptoms were associated with a better prognosis. Location of the primary tumor, age, and sex did not appear to have prognostic value. Observations during operation such as palpable lymph nodes, fixity to adjacent organs, and tumor spill were related to a diminished tumor-free survival. Laboratory data (hemoglobin, leukocytes, ESR, GGTP, SGOT, SGPT, LDH, total protein, CEA) were tested for their potential prognostic values. Only a preoperative low protein level or an elevated CEA level were associated with an increased risk of death due to recurrent tumor. The histopathologic features (stage and grade), with the exception of venous invasion, were of relative importance in the determination of prognosis. The aforementioned variables can be included in a prognostic index on the base of which high-risk groups suitable for adjuvant studies can be identified."

In the present series, recurrent disease was evident after hepatic resection, most commonly in the lungs; the liver; and locally, in that order. About half of the 45 patients with a second recurrence were operated on, and the recurrence was completely removed in roughly half of these patients. A median survival estimate of 31 months (range 1 to 67 months) after complete removal of the second recurrence was better than the survival estimate of 14 months (range 1 to 18 months) for those in whom the recurrence could not be removed (p less than 0.01). An elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level as the only indicator of recurrence after hepatic resection has proved to be an ominous prognostic sign."

Liver and renal function should be assessed. Unresectable extraabdominal and intraabdominal recurrence or metastases should be excluded. Patients being evaluated for recurrence after curative resection of a rectosigmoid cancer should undergo a bone scan. Having satisfactorily ensured normal results for these investigations, the surgeon should then proceed to search for an intraabdominal source of tumor recurrence."

Elevated levels of CEA-containing circulating immune complexes (CEA-IC) were found in 15.4% of 117 sera from patients with colorectal cancer in a postsurgery follow-up study. Also in 24.5% of 102 sera from patients with breast cancer in different states of disease CEA-IC were found. The predominant Ig determined in CEA-IC of colorectal cancer patients was IgA, followed by IgG and IgM, whereas IgG and IgM were the most frequent Igs in CEA-IC of breast cancer patients. Elevated CEA levels were found in 12.0% of the colorectal cancer patients and in 25.4% of sera from breast cancer patients. No significance for the coincidence of elevated CEA levels and CEA-IC was recorded in all patients sera tested. In sera of patients with disease recurrence, however, both parameters were shown to be elevated (CEA 80.7% and CEA-IC 42.3%). The data presented indicate the detection of CEA-IC as an additional parameter for the identification of patients at increased risk for disease recurrence."
CD011134,0,3263037,0,High-dose folinic acid and 5-fluorouracil in the treatment of advanced colon cancer.,"Forty-eight patients with measurable metastatic colorectal cancer were treated with leucovorin (FA), 80 mg/m2 as an intravenous (i.v.) infusion over 20 h, followed by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 400 mg/m2, i.v. push on days 1-3. This same dose of FA was then administered as a 1-h infusion on day 11 and weekly thereafter, followed by 5-FU, 400 mg/m2, slow intravenous (i.v.) push. Thirty patients had received no prior chemotherapy, and 18 patients had received chemotherapy with various other regimens. The drugs were well tolerated, with minimal hematologic toxicity and mild to moderate gastrointestinal and mucosal toxicity. Three complete responses (CRs) and nine partial responses (PRs) were observed. Nineteen additional patients remained stable for prolonged periods of time, and 12 patients continued to progress through treatment. The median survival for responders was 52.5 weeks. The patients who had received prior chemotherapy had lower response rates than the previously untreated patients, but responses were seen in both subsets. The CR plus PR rate in previously untreated patients was 30%, with 40% having stabilization of disease. The CR plus PR rate in patients previously treated with other chemotherapy regimens was 19%, with an additional 50% having stabilization of disease. Patients with stable disease appeared to have a clinical benefit similar to that of patients with PR. Toxicity was generally mild and acceptable and consisted mainly of nausea, vomiting, and mucositis. At these dosage levels, diarrhea was not a limiting toxicity. CRs and PRs occurred only in patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 1 and 2. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels generally reflected the type of clinical response and could often predict responders early on in the course of treatment, but did not quantitatively correlate with the degree of response. This regimen has efficacy at least similar to that of standard 5-FU regimens, and appears to have activity as a ""salvage therapy"" also. The minimal toxicity of this regimen, its convenience for outpatient use, and the relatively low expense as compared with regimens employing a higher dose of FA recommend it for further investigation."

The long-term survival after secondary procedure was 17.5% for patients with normal CEA value at time of reoperation and surmounted life expectancy of patients with rising tumour-marker level significantly (5.9%). The worst prognosis was found for the collective with rising CEA before diagnosis of relapse by other means, none of whom was saved by reoperation.

Of 51 blood samples obtained from 31 patients with metastatic breast cancer (Stage IV disease), 98% had marker levels greater than 30 u/ml and 86% had levels greater than 50 u/ml. In contrast, of 49 samples from 42 patients with Stage I-II disease, 45% had levels greater than 30 u/ml but only 6% had levels greater than 50 u/ml (mean 29.5 +/- 18 u/ml). The mean level of the CA15-3 antigen in patients with Stage IV breast cancer and responding to therapy was 79.8 +/- 27 u/ml, while the mean level in patients not responding to therapy was 134 +/- 66 u/ml (P less than 0.02). The mean serial changes in CA15-3 levels for those responding to therapy was -28.4% while the mean change for those not responding to therapy was +44%. The mean marker level for 26 patients with colorectal carcinoma was 29.8 +/- 29 u/ml; 23% of these patients had levels greater than 30 u/ml and 7% had levels greater than 50 u/ml. No substantial difference was seen in those with active compared with nonactive colorectal carcinoma. The mean marker level for 14 patients with active ovarian carcinoma was 83 +/- 62 u/ml. Of these patients, 78% had CA15-3 levels greater than 30 u/ml and 50% had levels greater than 50 u/ml. All healthy subjects (n = 22) had marker levels less than 30 u/ml. We compared CA15-3 and CEA blood levels in the same patient population; 86% of patients with metastatic breast cancer (Stage IV disease) had CA15-3 levels greater than 50 u/ml while only 72% of these patients had CEA levels greater than 5 ng/ml. These findings suggest that the CA15-3 assay reflects the clinical course of patients with advanced breast cancer and may be superior to CEA as a monitor of therapeutic efficacy."

Monoclonal antibodies, especially CA 19-9 and CA 50 may give additional information whereas CA 125 seems to be of no value in patients with colorectal cancer. The sensitivity of CEA determination for Dukes' A carcinomas is as low as 30%, but increases to 85% for Dukes' D carcinomas. The best clinical benefit of CEA is in postoperative monitoring of surgically treated patients with colorectal cancer. The sensitivity and specificity for distant metastases are 85%. The sensitivity in the detection of local recurrence is low (40%) but the specificity is still high (80%). A high CEA level postoperatively strongly suggests either local recurrence or disseminated disease, but a negative value does not exclude their presence. If CEA is negative both preoperatively and one month postoperatively, CA 19-9 or CA 50 may be used in the monitoring of these patients."

Pelvic recurrences are often detected by thorough physical examination. In general, however, the sensitivity of the clinical examination is low, so that about 75% of the patients have symptomatic recurrence when it is detected clinically. Serial examinations of CEA, however, seem at present time to be the best indication of recurrence. Thus, elevated serum CEA concentration seems to predict cancer recurrence correctly in 80-90%."

As a general policy the metastases were resected 3-4 months after resection of the primary tumour. At the end of this interval a thorough assessment was made for recurrent local, regional or extrahepatic metastatic disease before making a decision to perform liver resection. Eighteen patients had a conventional liver resection (13 major liver resections, 5 limited liver resections) and 14 patients had an atypical liver resection (metastasectomy). Patients were followed at 4 monthly intervals after operation using ultrasonography and CEA determination. The operative mortality (within 60 days) was zero. Twenty-six patients (81%) had a totally uncomplicated postoperative course. The period of hospitalization was 14 +/- 2 days. Two patients had a second liver resection at a later date on account of tumour recurrence. The survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 84%, 58% and 33% respectively.

To standardize this kind of immunotherapy the following parameters of the DE-TA cell have been evaluated:--Karyotype (46 chromosomes, deletions in chromosome 8; 17); doubling time 24 hr; expression of CEA.--Stability of membrane antigens characterized by 9 different monoclonal antibodies over more than 40 cell culture passages.--Homogeneity of cell culture as evaluated by limiting dilution cloning at different culture passages and evaluation of expression of membrane antigens. Immunogenicity of lyophilized cells compared to cultured fresh cells by counting the number of specific antibody secreting clones after fusing spleen cells of immunized mice with SP-2/0-Ag14 mouse myeloma. As this characterization as well as safety tests (lack of infectious particles, tumorigenicity in nude mice) revealed no apparent risks, lyophilized DE-TA cells will be used as a standardized stable cell preparation for clinical trials."

Eleven patients had markedly elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels postoperatively without evidence of residual or recurrent disease. The laboratory method of measuring CEA levels was a commercially available double mouse monoclonal antibody enzyme immunoassay. It was postulated that the unexplained elevation of CEA was a reflection of the presence of human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) induced by the administration of radiolabeled mouse antibody. A competitive assay for HAMA was undertaken by incubation of these patients' sera with a high dose of nonspecific mouse immunoglobulin prior to CEA determinations, and subsequent CEA levels were normal. The presence of HAMA was confirmed by a noncompetitive solid-phase enzyme immunoassay in 73% of tested patients who received murine monoclonal antibodies for imaging. Identification of artifactual CEA elevations is important in the treatment of cancer patients."

The cut-off value (4.0 U/ml) was obtained according to the levels and the distribution of CA72-4 in 468 healthy individuals. The positive rates in 82 patients with gastric cancer, 55 with colorectal cancer, 24 with pancreatico-choledochal cancer, 36 with breast cancer, and 3 with ovarian cancer were 52%, 55%, 46%, 39%, and 67%, respectively. Fifty percent of the sera from 205 patients with carcinoma demonstrated increased levels of CA72-4, whereas only 10% of the sera from 192 patients without evidence of malignancy showed levels more than 4.0 U/ml. The average level of serum CA72-4 in the patients with carcinoma was 38.6 U/ml, much higher than that (2.7 U/ml) in patients without malignancy. The patients with gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages or at recurrence showed higher levels of serum CA72-4 than the patients with cancer at early stages.

CEA levels of draining blood (mean 62.7 ng/ml and positive rate greater than 5 ng/ml, 63.9%) were significantly higher than those (16.3 ng/ml and 31.5%) of peripheral blood. However, CA19-9 levels (mean 576 U/ml and positive rate greater than 37 U/ml, 29.5%) of draining blood were not different from those (568.0 U/ml and 29.5%) of peripheral blood. Histochemically, CEA was observed in all of the 83 specimens and distributed in almost of all cancer cells, although CA19-9 was found in 52 (62.5%) of 83 specimens and focally localized in some part of cancer lesions. Elevation of CEA levels in draining and peripheral blood was most highly correlated with grade of venous invasion and its layer of colorectal wall. While, elevation of CA19-9 levels in both draining and peripheral blood was most highly associated with grade of lymphatic invasion and node metastasis. CEA levels of peripheral blood was negative in 9 (47.4%) of 19 patients with liver metastasis. However, the levels of draining blood was negative only one (5.3%) of these patients and the mean value (273.6 ng/ml) was much greater than that (59.6 ng/ml) of peripheral blood. These results suggest that CEA may be haematogenously drained by the portal system via the draining vein from the cancer cells in the invasive veins, and that CA19-9 may be drained by the thoracic duct of lymphatic system. It is also suggested that the measurement of CEA, especially in draining blood, and CA19-9 may be available to predict the metastasis and/or recurrence of different organs such as the liver, lymph node and so on."

CD011134,0,3054922,0,Ornithine decarboxylase as a marker for colorectal polyps and cancer.,"There is as yet no specific chromosomal abnormality or gene marker identified for colorectal polyps and cancer. Thus available markers include only phenotypic markers. Tumor markers that have been studied include tetraploidy and increased colonic mucosal proliferation; and these markers have identified those patients that are at high risk for colon cancer. The current ""gold standard"" of colorectal cancer markers is the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). CEA is best used as a monitor of disease and recurrence, and not as a screening or diagnostic test. Newer carbohydrate markers include CA 19-9, incompatible A and B antigens, and T and Lewis antigens. These markers have not shown increased specificity or sensitivity compared to CEA. An interesting recently described marker is ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which serves as a simple overall index of colonic mucosal proliferation. Ornithine decarboxylase levels have shown correlation with the progression from normal mucosa to adenoma and carcinoma, especially in hereditary polyposis syndromes. This enzyme may also serve as a potential therapeutic target. Many markers have been found useless in further clinical trials. Ornithine decarboxylase needs to be studied in greater detail to determine its sensitivity and specificity, in patients with hereditary colonic neoplasia and in patients without genetic syndromes."

Additional study of the effectiveness of these recommendations is in progress, but the medical community has generally endorsed them and urges their implementation in office practice. To date, chemotherapy is not clearly indicated as adjuvant therapy, but enrollment of patients in cooperative group protocols is recommended. Use of second-look surgery to resect selected recurrent tumors has increased in recent years, in part because of the contribution of the computed tomographic scan and carcinoembryonic antigen assay to follow-up of postoperative patients. For advanced disease, technologic advances have improved the technique of hepatic artery perfusion with chemotherapeutic agents, but evidence of a survival advantage afforded by this method is still lacking. Single-agent chemotherapy with fluorouracil remains the best choice for palliating advanced disease, but hepatic artery perfusion with floxuridine also may relieve liver-dominant disease."

CEA release by cells in vitro and in vivo is associated with the conversion of CEA from a membrane-bound, hydrophobic molecule to a soluble, hydrophilic form with no apparent decrease in molecular mass. When LS-174T cell membranes were incubated with various buffers, proteases, and phospholipases, the only agents that released CEA and converted it to the hydrophilic form were preparations of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Both [3H]ethanolamine and [3H]palmitate could be incorporated metabolically into CEA but only palmitate was released by treatment with PI-PLC, consistent with the presence of a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. PI-PLC treatment also release significant quantities of CEA from living monolayers and from seven human colon cancer specimens. These experiments suggest that cellular CEA is anchored to membranes by a covalent linkage to a membrane phosphatidylinositol molecule, and that an endogenous phospholipase may be important for releasing CEA in vitro and in vivo."
CD011134,0,2837115,0,Hepatic resections: an eight year experience at a community hospital.,"Between April 1979 and March 1987 24 patients underwent 26 hepatic resections. Colorectal liver metastases constituted the largest group (n = 18), followed by hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 2), Echinococcal liver cyst (n = 1), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1), and leiomyosarcoma (n = 1). The mean age was 41.8 +/- 14.6 years (range: 23-69 years). Fifteen women and nine men comprised the group. The operative morbidity was 21 per cent, the 30-day operative mortality was 8 per cent (two deaths). Both operative deaths occurred in patients with colorectal liver metastases. The 18 patients with colorectal liver metastases included ten women and eight men. The mean age was 59.1 +/- 6.5 years (range: 46-69 years). There were seven synchronous and 11 metachronous liver metastases. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was found elevated in 14 of the original primary colonic carcinomas, and in all but one patient with metachronous liver metastases. The mean time from colorectal carcinoma resection to occurrence of metachronous metastases was 17.1 +/- 5.8 months. To date, 10 patients have had recurrences of liver metastases after hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastases. The mean time of recurrence was 12.6 +/- 11.9 months. The size of the metastases was 3.8 +/- 3.2 cm (range: 0.2-17 cm). The mean number of lesions present was 1.5 +/- 1.0. The 1 year and 2 year actuarial survival rates were 87.5 and 43.8 per cent respectively. The longest survivor is alive 54 months after his hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastases and remains to this date disease free.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011134,0,2836570,0,Early recognition of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma utilizing gallium-67 citrate scintigraphy.,"Gallium-67 scintigraphy is a valuable test together with other screening tests such as alpha feto-protein (AFP) and other imaging modalities in following up recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Three patients were followed in our institution for intervals varying from 2-24 mo after successful resection of uninodular localized hepatomas. In the first patient, gallium scan showed abnormal localized activity while the computed tomography (CT) scan and the magnetic resonance imaging were negative. Liver function tests and AFP were also normal and the patient was operated upon only on the basis of the gallium scan. The second patient had a follow-up gallium scan 2 mo after the first operation that showed an area of increased activity along the inferior aspect of the right lobe. A CT scan done after that showed no evidence of recurrence, but subsequently became positive when repeated 4 mo later. The third patient had abnormal simultaneous gallium scan and CT scan demonstrating a recurrence in the left adrenal gland while both AFP and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal. This has led us to consider every patient a candidate for a baseline and follow-up gallium scan for evaluation for recurrence following HCC."

CD011134,0,3827362,0,Patterns of failure following surgical resection of colorectal cancer liver metastases. Rationale for a multimodal approach.,"A total of 45 patients, after surgical resection of colorectal liver cancer metastases, were retrospectively analyzed to define areas of failure, to identify some possible prognostic factors (site of primary, stage, site, number of metastases, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen, differentiation of the primary, type of surgery), and to seek a new rationale for a multimodal approach. The median postoperative follow-up was 18 months (range: 4-45 months). Survival rate was calculated by the actuarial method, and statistical significance was tested by the Mantel-Haenszel test. Twenty-eight patients had a relapse. These recurrences were hepatic in 11 patients, extrahepatic (intra- and extra-abdominal) in 12 patients, and intra- and extrahepatic in five patients: The stage (classification of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan) was the most important parameter related to the overall recurrence rate (47% in stage I, 62% in stage II, and 81% in stage III) and to the overall and disease-free survival. Stage was significantly related to hepatic relapse but not to extrahepatic relapse. In stage I the failure rate of 18 months was similar in hepatic and extrahepatic relapses (one third to one fourth of the patients); in stages II and III the hepatic failure rate was always higher than the extrahepatic rate. These data indicate that surgery alone is an inadequate form of therapy in cases of colorectal cancer metastases of the liver, and an adjuvant therapy, including alternate regimens of intraperitoneal and systemic chemotherapy, should be considered."
CD011134,0,3803120,1,Variation in recognition of recurrent colonic cancer by different CEA assays.,"Forty-six patients were followed with serial CEA determinations by two CEA assays after curative resection of a primary or recurrent colonic cancer. Thirteen have had a histologically proven recurrence, of which only six (46 percent) were predicted by both assays, while seven (54 percent) were predicted by one assay only. The assays appear complementary in indicating tumor recurrence, and preliminary findings suggest that it may be beneficial to follow patients with more than one CEA assay after resection of a primary or recurrent colonic cancer."
CD011134,0,3690235,0,Exfoliated cells and in vitro growth in colorectal cancer.,"Cells exfoliated from colorectal cancers may only be implicated in local recurrence if they are proven to be viable and capable of growth. Thirty patients with primary colorectal cancer were studied. Cells were obtained from primary tumour, uninvolved mucosa, mesorectum, lumen of the bowel, luminal mucus, serosal surface of the bowel and from washings of the tumour bed after dissection. Colonies grew in vitro in monolayer culture from 21/30 primary tumours; 11/41 mesorectum specimens; 11/27 luminal washings; 14/29 luminal mucus specimens; 1/27 serosal surface washings and 3/13 post-dissection washes. Colonies stained positively for the epithelial markers cytokeratin and desmosomes and also for carcinoembryonic antigen. Cells capable of in vitro growth are present in these various sites and, if spilled at operation, may well be implicated as one of the factors leading to local recurrence."

CD011134,0,3677890,0,[Current role of immunoscintigraphy for surgical therapy of the recurrence of colorectal cancers].,"In patients with local recurrence or liver metastases from colorectal cancer the preoperative results of conventional diagnostic methods (sonography, computed tomography, x-ray, endoscopy) and immunoscintigraphy performed with 131I labeled CEA/Ca 19-9 antibodies were compared to intraoperative findings. Specificity of immunoscintigraphy in detecting liver metastases was higher compared to conventional diagnostic methods but its predictive reliability was disappointing, especially in regard to diagnosis of the number of liver metastases and detection of local recurrence or peritoneal seedings. Compared to all intraoperative findings a positive predictive value of 74% and a negative predictive value of 42% for immunoscintigraphy could be found as compared to 88% and 63%, respectively, for conventional diagnostic methods. So immunoscintigraphy in our experience cannot give more information beyond conventional diagnostic tools for indication or planning of operative strategy in the treatment of recurrent colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,3675195,0,Hyperthermic pelvic isolation-perfusion in the treatment of refractory pelvic cancer.,"Hyperthermic isolation-perfusion (I-P) was used to treat 27 patients with refractory pelvic cancer. All patients except one achieved pelvic isolation as manifested by selective pelvic heating and by pharmacologic monitoring. Patient response was good, with rapid pain relief in 75% and tumor control as detected by physical examination, computed tomographic scan, and decline in carcinoembryonic antigen levels. Pelvic drug exposure averaged 7.8 times that of systemic drug exposure. Of the 20 patients with recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma, one complete response (duration, eight months), seven partial responses (average duration, greater than or equal to 10 months), four patients with stable disease (average duration, greater than or equal to 12 months), and five with disease progression were observed. Three patients could not be evaluated due to late deaths as a consequence of their disease. There were two postoperative deaths in the remaining seven patients, one due to drug toxicity and one due to probable cardiac arrhythmia. Pelvic I-P has evolved with the avoidance of laparotomy and increased drug dose. We conclude that hyperthermic I-P for pelvic cancer is a safe, effective procedure and an excellent therapeutic option for patients with persistent pelvic cancer."
CD011134,0,3673304,1,[CEA determination in the follow-up of colorectal cancers].,CEA follow-up checks of 135 patients with colorectal carcinoma are described in a retrospective analysis.

Laminin levels were significantly elevated in patients with carcinomas and leukemias, but not in patients with sarcomas or lymphomas when compared with healthy controls. A good correlation could be found between serum laminin concentration and response to therapy in patients with carcinoma and leukemia. Elevated laminin levels were associated with a progressive course of the tumor condition. Furthermore, a close correlation has been detected between serum concentrations of laminin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in patients with carcinoma of the colon. The serum laminin level seems to be a valuable parameter for observation of the course of certain malignancies."
CD011134,0,3622555,0,Tumor scintigraphy with 131I anti CEA monoclonal antibodies and F(ab')2 in colorectal cancer.,"In 14 patients with proven local recurrence of colorectal cancer or metastases in liver and/or lungs, the sensitivity (SE) in detecting tumor sites was estimated in a single-blind study using conventional planar whole body scintigraphy. Nine patients received F(ab')2 and five received MAB by intravenous infusion over 30 min with a dose of 40-200 MBq after skin testing and thyroid blocking, scanning was performed 1-7 days later. All but one patient had elevated plasma CEA levels with a mean of 25.5 +/- 31.9 ng/ml. The scans were interpreted by two independent observers. In five of the nine patients receiving F(ab')2, the tumor site could be visualized, yielding a sensitivity of 55%. No tumor sites were identified with MAB. The highest tumor uptake was recorded in a patient with additional ovarian cancer with the activity accumulating in the ovarian cancer. The optimum time for imaging was 3 or 4 days after injection. There was no correlation between positive imaging and plasma CEA levels which ranged from 1.9 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml in the positive cases. The thyroid uptake on the sixth day was 0.68% +/- 0.2% of the total dose given despite thyroid blocking. Bone uptake of 131I was also observed, this was mild in four patients, moderate in three but high in one patient, especially on days one to four. Thus, only anti-CEA F(ab')2 seem to be of clinical interest for further evaluation in localizing colorectal cancer. Regarding the still low sensitivity of 55%, further improvement can be expected by gaining experience, using more appropriate isotopes such as 111In and SPECT. The estimated radiation side effects on thyroid and bone marrow are only modest."
CD011134,0,3608853,0,"[Colon carcinoma. Preoperative CEA, tumor differentiation and prognosis].","Investigations on 279 patients with colon carcinoma revealed an increase in the sensitivity of the CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) test with regard to tumor stage from 42% (Dukes A) to 86% (Dukes D). Curative operable carcinoma without lymph-node or distant metastases had CEA levels up to 70 ng/ml. CEA values below 20 ng/ml had no predictive value concerning resectability at first operation. When the CEA level rose above 20 ng/ml, the proportion of curative operations fell from 83% (CEA values below 20 ng/ml) to 17%. Recurrence rate rose with the preoperative level of CEA from 22% (CEA less than 2.5 ng/ml) to 62% (CEA greater than 10 ng/ml). The resection rate at second operation had a closer relationship than at first operation to the preoperative CEA level; it fell from 50% (CEA less than 5.0 ng/ml) to 0% (CEA greater than 20 ng/ml). At operation, highly differentiated tumors were found to be at an early stage in 50% of cases, compared to 26% of G2 and 11% of G3 tumors. In 44% of dedifferentiated tumors CEA levels were above 20 ng/ml. An influence of tumor differentiation on CEA remained even after division into the individual tumor stages."
CD011134,0,3589978,0,A simplified plan for follow-up of patients with colon and rectal cancer supported by prospective studies of laboratory and radiologic test results.,"Reports of prolonged survival in patients with recurrent colon or rectal cancer following a reoperative surgery suggest that early diagnosis of locally persistent or limited metastatic disease may save some patients. To determine which laboratory and radiologic tests were useful, a prospective comparison of all currently available modalities was begun in 1978. Sixty-six patients at high risk for recurrent large-bowel cancer were studied. At present, mean follow-up is at 4 1/2 years. Protocol studies included monthly carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assays for 3 years and then at 3-month intervals for 2 more years. A review of symptoms and a physical examination were performed every 4 months for 3 years and then every 6 months for 2 more years. Computerized tomograms of the abdomen, full lung tomograms, and liver/spleen scintigrams were obtained every 4 months for 3 years and then annually for 2 more years. Intravenous pyelography, barium enema, and bone scintigraphy were performed yearly for 5 years. Thirty-three recurrences were observed in 31 patients. A progressive rise in serial CEA values was the first indication of recurrence in 22 of 33 patients (67%), review of symptoms and physical examination in seven of 33 (21%), CT scan in two of 33, and bone scintigraphy and full lung tomography each in one of 33 patients. Serial CEA assays and routine visits to a physician's office were the most useful tests in this study population. Use of a simplified follow-up plan will result in the earliest detection of recurrent colon cancer."
CD011134,0,3586345,0,[Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal carcinoma].,"Twelve patients with pulmonary metastases of recurrent colorectal carcinoma underwent pulmonary resection at National Ohkura Hospital. The Cumulative five-year survival rate was 60 per cent. No correlation was found between the disease-free interval and survival following thoracotomy. There was a statistically significant difference in survival rates corresponding to Duke's classification of the primary lesion. Patients with solitary lesions had a better survival rate than patients with multiple lesions. We believe that the surgical treatment of pulmonary metastases in a select group of patients, i.e., those with solitary pulmonary lesions, will prolong survival and be curative in a number of patients."
CD011134,0,3580687,0,The value of carcinoembryonic antigen in clinical practice.,Carcinoembryonic antigen has been investigated as a tumour marker for over 20 years.

CD011134,0,3568033,0,Plasma CEA in large bowel carcinoma: which patients should be followed by regular postoperative measurements? Preliminary follow-up results in 100 patients with different tumor DNA-ploidy patterns.,"In 100 patients with large bowel carcinomas, the tumors were divided into a distinctly aneuploid (AN) group (63) and a near diploid (ND) group (37) by flow cytometric (FCM) DNA quantitation of cell suspensions. Preoperative plasma CEA levels were determined in all patients. Thirty-eight patients with AN and 28 patients with ND tumors were operated on for cure and had normal plasma CEA levels postoperatively. These two groups had regular CEA plasma measurements as part of the clinical follow-up. In the AN group, 12 of 15 patients have had recurrence preceded by CEA elevation. In the ND group, however, only one of eight recurrences was preceded by a rise in CEA level; the one with elevation also had increased plasma CEA prior to operation. It thus seems that a low CEA output of ND tumors explains many of the ""false-negative"" CEA measurements in disseminated cases. It is concluded that, in addition to patients with an elevated preoperative plasma CEA level, all patients with aneuploid tumors should be subjected to repeated plasma CEA measurements as part of the follow-up program."
CD011134,0,3551880,0,Hepatic cryosurgery with intraoperative ultrasound monitoring for metastatic colon carcinoma.,"We utilized cryosurgery with intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) monitoring in ten patients to treat multiple unresectable hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma. The liver was exposed at laparotomy, and tumors were subjected to three cycles of freezing (eight minutes each) and thawing. Freezing was monitored by IOUS, which visualized frozen tumor as a hyperechoic rim with posterior acoustic shadowing. Frozen normal liver appeared hypoechoic after thawing compared with normal unfrozen liver. There were no significant complications. The follow-up ranged from four months to 17 months (median, 7.5 months). Tumor response was documented by pathologic findings (coagulative necrosis), progressive fall of carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and computed tomographic scan evidence of necrosis and shrinkage of tumor. One patient underwent repeated laparotomy five months after cryosurgery and had the frozen lesions resected; there was no residual tumor. This study establishes the technical feasibility and antitumor response of hepatic cryosurgery and the use of IOUS for precise localization and monitoring of cryoablations."
CD011134,0,3501859,0,[Immunoscintigraphy using 111In-DTPA-labeled monoclonal antibodies: comparison with ECT and planar scintigraphy].,"The present study was done in order to examine if the use of 111In-DTPA-labeled MAb fragments in place of 131I-labeled MAb fragments increases the sensitivity of tomographic immunoscintigraphy to reach the level of that of planar imaging techniques. In 11 patients with various primary tumors, local recurrences or metastases [colorectal carcinoma (n = 7), ovarian carcinoma (n = 2), papillary thyroid carcinoma (n = 1), undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung (n = 1)], immunoscintigraphy (IS) was carried out using 111In-DTPA-labeled F(ab')2 fragments of various MAbs (anti-CEA, OC 125, anti-hTG) and planar and tomographic imaging were compared intra-individually. By conventional diagnostic procedures, the presence of a tumor mass was confirmed (transmission computer tomography, ultrasound) or verified (131I whole-body scintigraphy, histology) in all cases. Immunoscintigraphy was positive in 9 out of 11 cases by ECT and in 10 out of 11 cases by planar imaging. When using 111In-labeled MAb fragments, intra-individual comparison of ECT and planar imaging resulted in a similar sensitivity. The increased sensitivity of ECT using this tracer in contrast to 131I-labeled MAb fragments may be attributed to the fact that the physical properties of 111In are much more suitable for the gamma cameras most commonly used (single detector, 3/8'' crystal); using 111In-labeled MAb fragments, count rates sufficient for ECT can be obtained within a reasonable acquisition time. This allows to combine IS with the advantages of ECT regarding tumour localization and prevention of artefacts due to superposition of background."
CD011134,0,3480768,0,The value of CA 19-9 in gastric and colorectal carcinoma.,"We have conducted a prospective study of 441 patients, to investigate the utility of a new tumor marker CA 19-9 for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract (93 patients with colorectal carcinoma, 57 with carcinoma of the stomach, 10 with esophageal carcinoma, 45 with malignancies outside the gastrointestinal tract, and 236 with benign general surgical disease). Results were compared to those obtained for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the diagnosis of carcinoma of the stomach and colon/rectum. CEA is more sensitive than CA 19-9 in all stages of carcinoma of the stomach and colon/rectum. During treatments of gastrointestinal carcinomas, CEA and CA 19-9 were determined at the same time in 66 and 165 patients with surgically treated carcinoma of the stomach and colorectal carcinoma, respectively. It was noted that CEA is more sensitive than CA 19-9 in detecting recurrence. However, CA 19-9 is more specific. The best results were obtained when both markers were used together."

An experience with CEA, TPA, Ca 19-9 analysis and second-look surgery.","Sixty-four consecutive patients who had undergone curative resection for colorectal carcinoma were studied prospectively to evaluate the roles of sequential CEA determinations and independent instrumental follow-up in the early detection of resectable recurrences. Fifty-two of these patients also were submitted to sequential determinations of other tumor antigens: TPA (tissue polypeptide antigen) and Ca 19-9 (colon cancer antigen detected with a monoclonal antibody), for a retrospective evaluation of their utility as markers of recurrent tumors. Twenty-two recurrences were detected in a period ranging from 12 to 72 months (median, 47 months). CEA was the best predictor of recurrence (sensitivity, 90 percent) when compared with the other two markers (TPA sensitivity, 60 percent; Ca 19-9 sensitivity, 20 percent). When compared with the instrumental or biochemical examinations of the follow-up, CEA was still the most sensitive indicator of relapse although the specificity was quite low (78 percent) if minimal significative increases were considered. History and physical examination were more useful than CEA in detecting local recurrences in rectal cancer where the preoperative CEA level was low. A few second-look explorations based solely on small CEA increases failed to demonstrate recurrence or revealed peritoneal carcinomatosis. Selected second-look surgery based on demonstrated recurrences resulted in a resectability rate of 57 percent. A follow-up program based on frequent CEA assays, history, and physical examinations, including rectal, vaginal, and perineal exploration, is proposed. Extensive instrumental investigations should follow when a minimal significative CEA rise is observed, or when history and physical examinations suggest a possible recurrence. Second-look surgery should be evaluated after confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of recurrence, on the basis of instrumental or clinical examinations."
CD011134,0,3435012,0,Serum CEA in the management of recurrent colorectal cancer.,"While cell surface antigens restricted to cancer cells have not yet been identified, a number of antigens have been described which are present in greater amounts in association with cancer cells. CEA is present on the cell surface of the majority of colorectal cancers and is released into the serum where it can be used to monitor for disease recurrence. The presence of CEA on the cell surface can be used to localise the site of tumour recurrence by antibody/isotope conjugate scanning. A fall in serum CEA after treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy can be used to predict patients whose survival will be prolonged by the chemotherapy. As more effective treatments of disseminated colorectal carcinoma are developed, serum CEA may play an increasing role in monitoring response to treatment."

A monoclonal antibody specific to one or several tumour cell lines is used. The antibody is labelled with a gamma emitter radioisotope and so that it can be detected in vivo. We have evaluated three monoclonal antibodies (F(ab')2 fragments): a mixture of anti-CEA and anti-19.9 antibodies in the investigation of colorectal carcinoma and the antibody OC-125 in ovarian cancer. In our experience, it appears that pelvic recurrence is the best indication for immunoscintigraphy. Antibodies can apparently be safely used in man.

CD011134,0,3325290,0,A new approach to image subtraction in immunoscintigraphy: preliminary results.,"Recently proposed image comparison software is applied to immunoscintigraphy. The software performs geometric and gray level registration of two images and generates an image of the statistically significant differences. It permits the comparison of scintigraphic images recorded at different times. It is used to subtract 113mIn and 111Inphytate colloid liver scans and early (blood pool) images from 131I or 111In-monoclonal Ab images and to compare Ab images recorded at different times. Using the procedures made possible by this software, only images recorded using the same radionuclide or using radionuclides of about the same energy are compared. Anti CEA, 19-9 and OC 125 F(ab)2 fragments labeled with 131I or 111In are used in 32 patients with 47 demonstrated recurrences or metastases of colorectal or ovarian cancers. The overall sensitivities of the unprocessed and processed images are 25/47 and 41/47 respectively. The improvement in sensitivity is particularly high in the liver when In labelled Ab are used. This technique improves the contrast of the images, but the interpretation must take into account the components of the non target activity (kidney, bone marrow, colon...) which are not removed by the image subtraction method."
CD011134,0,3318646,0,Current trends in the treatment of colorectal cancer.,"In recent years interest in the management of bowel cancer has focussed mainly on two main considerations:- A The prospect of improving the overall curability by:- The achievement of much earlier presymptomatic diagnosis with the aid of Hemoccult screening of sections of the population at risk; The deployment of more radical techniques of operation, especially in regard to rectal cancer; The supplementation of surgical excision with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy; The development of a more meticulous regime of follow-up after operation, using CEA monitoring and occasional ""second look"" operations to deal with recurrence. B The greater use of sphincter-saving types of excision for growths of the middle and lower parts of the rectum. To this end several new techniques of rectal resection have become popular--especially the downward extrusion of low anterior resection with the aid of the circular stapler. In addition, for small very favourable low growths local excision or local destruction by diathermy fulguration or contact irradiation have been employed. The rationale and success of these two forms of endeavour are examined."

Fifteen patients with colorectal tumors underwent external scintigraphy following the administration of 5.5 mCi (203.5 MBq) In-111 ZCE-025 at doses of 2.5-80.0 mg. Eighteen of 20 documented tumor sites, excluding those in the liver, were detected with In-111 ZCE-025. Lesions less than 1.5 cm could not be detected. Twenty-five percent of liver metastases exhibited positive accumulation of In-111 ZCE-025 at doses of 40-80 mg. No side effects were encountered. Because of the high detection rate of lymph node metastases from colorectal carcinoma with In-111 ZCE-025, this technique may be helpful in preoperative staging of patients with colorectal tumors, as well as in distinguishing recurrent tumors from postoperative or postradiation changes seen on computed tomography scans or other radiologic images."

Unfortunately, most of these markers are useless in screening or diagnosis. Nevertheless, such markers as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 may have a role in pretherapeutic and posttherapeutic monitoring of disease or recurrence. The newer tumor markers, including the carbohydrate markers, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and the polyamines, are of great interest as potential tumor markers; ODC and the polyamines may also have a future potential as therapeutic targets.

A randomized trial comparing the hepatic artery with the portal vein.,"To evaluate which site of infusion maximizes tumor response to regional hepatic chemotherapy, 25 patients were randomized preoperatively to receive chemotherapy administration via hepatic artery or portal vein catheters. Of the 25 patients, five did not have catheters placed due to extrahepatic disease, and one patient did not receive infusion chemotherapy. Continuous floxuridine infusion was given at a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg/d, alternating with saline solution every two weeks. The mean percentage of hepatic tumor replacement (36% vs 41%), mean serum alkaline phosphatase level (218 vs 179 IU/mL), and mean plasma carcinoembryonic antigen level (689 vs 563 ng/mL) were similar in both groups. Four (50%) of eight hepatic artery patients responded to treatment compared with 0/11 portal vein patients. Ten of 11 portal vein patients showed progressive tumor growth; nine of these patients were crossed over to arterial infusion. Three (33%) of these nine patients had an objective tumor response with the hepatic arterial infusion.

Among 10 patients in whom the surgical margins of the specimen contained tumor cells, the median survival was 52 months. This survival was comparable to that among 10 patients in whom the surgical margins were tumor free (P = 0.22). Neither the number of metastatic liver deposits nor the disease-free interval between the primary diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma and the development of liver metastases significantly affected survival. A transient chemical hepatitis which resolved before the next scheduled treatment was associated with 50% of arterial chemotherapy cycles (approximately 70% of the patients). Gastric or duodenal ulcerations occurred in 23% of the patients. Surgical complications were either pulmonary such as pleural effusion or atelectasis, or wound infections and subphrenic abscesses. Although these results compare favorably with the results in previously published series, this aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy appears to be particularly justified in patients with tumor positive surgical margins or those with multiple tumor masses and, therefore, are characterized by a poor prognosis."
CD011134,0,2830075,1,[Value of CT following surgery for rectal cancer (a prospective study)].,"The results of computed tomography of 48 patients after operation on rectal carcinoma who underwent close-meshed computer tomographic examinations are given in a prospective study. (First examination 6 weeks after operation, further examinations at intervals of 3 months, mean observation time: 12 months). The results of follow-up by means of computer tomographic examination are compared with clinical examinations and control of CEA levels. The use of computer tomographic examination resulted in 43 confirmed negative, 3 confirmed positive and 2 false negative findings (including cases with CT-aided fine needle biopsy). These results give an accuracy of 96% and thus exceed clinical examination and controls of CEA-level. How far early diagnosis of local recurrence of rectal cancer influences survival time, can be answered after completion of this study in the next few years."
CD011134,0,2824273,0,Biological features and chemosensitivity of human colorectal cancer xenografted in nude mice.,"The chemosensitivity of human colorectal cancer was studied in relation to the biological features of the tumor using a human tumor/nude mouse in-vivo system. The biological features included the histological type, growth rate, mucus secretion and productivity of CEA of the tumor. The overall sensitivity to four anticancer agents examined (5-FU, MMC, CPA and CDDP) was relatively insignificant. The heterogeneity of chemosensitivity among primary, metastatic and recurrent lesions of the same patient was demonstrated. A tumor line obtained from poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma showed better responses to 3 of 4 agents. Tumor doubling time evaluated as an indicator of tumor growth rate showed a significant correlation with sensitivity to MMC. The time also showed a tendency to correlate with sensitivity to CDDP. The tumor with shorter tumor doubling time presented had more remarkable sensitivity to such agents. Similar correlation was observed in the mucus secretion shown by Alcian-blue (AB) staining and sensitivity to MMC and CDDP. Tumors with less significant AB staining showed more remarkable sensitivity to these agents. The productivity of CEA revealed a tendency to correlate with sensitivity to MMC and CPA. These results indicated that histological type, growth rate, mucus secretion by AB staining and productivity of CEA of the tumor might be parameters of chemosensitive differences of human colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,2434361,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen as a prognostic indicator in the radiotherapeutic management of rectal cancer.,Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels have been assessed retrospectively in a group of 32 patients with inoperable or recurrent carcinoma of the rectum treated with radiotherapy. Complete clinical regression of pelvic disease was only achieved in patients with pre-treatment CEA levels less than 30 ng/ml when no metastases were present. Pre-treatment CEA assay has a place as a prognostic indicator in the radiotherapeutic management of inoperable or recurrent carcinoma of the rectum.
CD011134,0,2434296,0,[Scintigraphic detection of malignancies with radioactively labelled tumor antibodies. Clinical results based on immunohistochemical research].,"69 patients with different tumors (colorectal, melanoma, testicle, ovary, bladder, carcinoid, lungs) were investigated by radioimmunoscintigraphy. The corresponding antibodies or their F(ab')2 fragments against CEA (n = 30), melanoma antigen (n = 25), TPA (n = 6), beta-HCG (n = 5), HMFG-2 (n = 2) and CEA/CA 19-9 (n = 1) were selected on the basis of immunohistochemical investigations of the primary tumors. The precision was 62%, and the number of false-negative findings was 32%. Additional clinical information (detection or exclusion of a suspected recurrence) could be obtained in 22 patients. From these results, it can be concluded that the corresponding tumor antibodies should be selected on the basis of immunohistochemical investigations of the primary tumor before performing radioimmunoscintigraphy to screen for recurrences or metastases."
CD011134,0,3954942,0,Localisation of gastrointestinal cancer with a 131 I labelled monoclonal antibody to CEA.,"The localisation of tumour deposits by a 131 I labelled monoclonal antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has been evaluated in 24 patients with primary gastric, oesophageal and colorectal cancer and in 26 patients with clinically suspected recurrent gastric and colorectal cancer. Seventeen of 20 primary sites and 6/15 associated secondary sites were correctly identified by external scanning. Measurement of radiolabelled antibody in the resected specimens demonstrated a 2.6-3.3 fold increase in comparison with the surrounding normal tissue (P less than 0.01). The antibody scans were compared with computerised tomography (CT) in the detection of recurrent disease. The respective sensitivities and specificities for the two investigations were 61% and 33% for antibody scanning and 64% and 100% for CT. Assessment of the distribution of labelled antibody demonstrated rapid clearance with less than 2% detectable in serum samples at 24 h. The implications of these findings together with the mechanisms of excretion are discussed."
CD011134,0,3951166,1,[The doubling time of circulating CEA as an individual prognostic criterion of recurrence in patients with gastrointestinal cancers].,"In a prospective study of 928 patients with gastrointestinal cancer registered for primary resection, the postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) time courses were analysed in connection with disease recurrence. Only patients with established diagnosis of disease recurrence and complete follow-up to death entered the evaluation of prognostic criteria of the CEA time course. In this group the CEA time courses of 103/201 patients with recurrent disease exhibited an exponential increase of the serum CEA concentration, i.e. a linear relationship of log CEA and time, which allowed the calculation of the CEA doubling time. All 103 patients developed metastatic spread and generally exhibited CEA doubling times ranging between 10 and 158 days, in patients developing peritoneal carcinosis up to 343 days. The individual CEA doubling times of patients with recurrent disease who received no treatment (n = 71) correlated well with the times of individual survival after the initial CEA increase of the log CEA phase (rs = 0.812; P less than 0.001) thus confirming the results of a previous retrospective study. When the survival time is expressed in multiples of the individual CEA doubling time (IDT), no patient survived longer than 10.8 IDT. The median value of survival was 5.4 IDT. Patients with metastatic spread who underwent various treatments of recurrent disease (n = 32) survived distinctly longer showing survival times up to 32.6 IDT. This could be confirmed by comparing the observed survival after the initial CEA increase of treated and untreated patients (life table method) exhibiting highly significant differences (P less than 0.001)."

CD011134,0,3947880,0,Radioimmunolocalization and selection for surgery in recurrent colorectal cancer.,"The value of radioimmunolocalization (RIL) of cancer depends on its performance in situations where the result determines the choice of management. A rise in serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) values after apparently curative resection of colorectal cancer implies localized, resectable recurrence in some patients and widespread unresectable tumour in others. This study investigated the ability of RIL with radiolabelled antibody to CEA and a novel numerical method for analysis of results to determine the extent of disease in 31 patients with raised serum CEA but no physical signs of recurrence. Surgical exploration or conventional radiology later confirmed the presence of tumour in 94 per cent of sites which were positive by RIL. Negative RIL predicted the absence of disease in 53 per cent of patients. The investigation could discriminate between localized and disseminated disease and often performed better than conventional radiology. RIL appears useful in selection of patients for second look laparotomy."
CD011134,0,3942992,0,The effect of tumor CEA content and tumor size on tissue uptake of indium 111-labeled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody.,"This study was undertaken to determine the effect of tumor size and tumor carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) content on the uptake of indium 111 (111In)-labeled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody in nude mice bearing xenografts. The tumor cell lines were WiDr, SW403, and LS174T, human colon cancer derivatives. The murine breast carcinoma cell line EMT-6 was used as a control. Tumor CEA levels (ng/g of tumor +/- standard error of the mean [SEM], measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) were: EMT-6, 0; WiDr, 105 +/- 5.7; LS174T, 2052 +/- 198; SW403, 17,575 +/- 1,785. The 111In-labeled monoclonal antibody was injected intravenously into mice bearing a single tumor. At 48 hours postinjection, scintiscan was performed, and the mice were killed so that biodistribution studies could be performed. The uptake of the monoclonal antibody was expressed as percent injected counts per minute per gram of tissue +/- SEM. The non-CEA-producing tumor, EMT-6, showed the lowest tumor uptake (1.4 +/- 0.3). WiDr, an intermediate CEA-producing tumor, showed some tumor uptake (16.4 +/- 1.5). The high CEA-producing tumors, SW403 and LS174T, had high tumor uptake (29.5 +/- 5.0 and 51.1 +/- 6.1, respectively). Biodistribution and scintiscan quality were closely related. Although LS174T had the best tumor uptake, SW403 had the highest CEA tumor content, indicating tumor CEA content cannot entirely predict scintiscan and biodistribution results. Tumor-to-blood (T/B), tumor-to-liver (T/L), and liver-to-blood (L/B) ratios were calculated for each animal and compared with tumor size. It was found that T/L had a negative correlation with tumor size (r = -0.72) and L/B had a positive correlation with tumor size (r = 0.94). These ratios may be useful clinically to follow response to therapy."
CD011134,0,3941861,0,Colorectal carcinoma evaluation with CT: preoperative staging and detection of postoperative recurrence.,"CT was performed prior to surgery in 103 patients with colorectal carcinoma to assess its value in staging the tumor. Preoperative IBD scans had sensitivities and specificities of 72.7% and 98.9% in detection of liver metastases, 25.9% and 96% in detection of lymph node metastases, and 61.2% and 80.6% in detection of local extension. Compared with the Duke's classification, CT correctly staged only 47.5% of patients: 16.6% were upstaged, and 83.3% were downstaged. Recurrent tumors developed in 11 of 67 patients followed for more than 24 months. CT depicted recurrence in six patients scanned prior to 12 months. Routine scans obtained at 12 months depicted unsuspected tumor recurrence in three of four patients with proved recurrent disease (one patient with pulmonary metastases did not undergo CT). This study indicates that because of the poor accuracy of CT in preoperative local staging of colorectal carcinoma, it has virtually no useful clinical role in this regard. However, preoperative CT evaluation of the liver can be useful. Routine postoperative CT, combined with fine-needle aspiration biopsy, is useful for detection of recurrent tumor."
CD011134,0,3816909,1,Comparison of two CEA assays in primary and recurrent large bowel carcinoma with different DNA ploidy pattern.,"Pre-operative CEA levels were measured in 100 patients with large bowel carcinomas with different DNA ploidy pattern and serial post-operative determinations performed in the 64 who had been operated for cure. The follow-up period was 3 1/2-8 yr. All CEA measurements were performed consecutively with a RIA (Roche), and subsequently repeated in one batch with an EIA (Roche) based on a monoclonal antibody. Both assays showed a similar number of 'false-negative' CEA levels pre-operatively--varying from 69% in aneuploid (AN) Dukes' A to 8% in AN Dukes' D tumours, and from 75% in near diploid (ND) Dukes' A to 40% in ND Dukes' D tumours. The sensitivity for detecting recurrence in patients with tumours of either ploidy pattern was slightly better with EIA than with RIA. A difference between the AN and ND group was shown somewhat better with RIA, the sensitivity in the AN group being 79% and the median lead time 7 months compared to 13% and 2 months in the ND group. The corresponding figures with EIA were 71% and 7 months for the AN group and 63% and 1 1/2 months for the ND group. However, all but one of the patients with ND DNA pattern who showed recurrence-associated CEA elevation with EIA also had an elevated level pre-operatively. We conclude that all patients operated for cure should be followed by regular CEA measurements post-operatively if they had an elevated CEA level prior to operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011134,0,3792170,0,Urinary polyamines in colorectal cancer.,"Urine polyamine content is increased in patients with colorectal malignancy and may be a useful tumor marker in the management of these patients. Urinary excretion of putrescine and spermidine was measured preoperatively and in the first week postoperatively in nine patients with inflammatory bowel disease, eight with other benign colorectal disease, and 13 with colorectal cancer. Preoperative urine putrescine levels were elevated similarly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and malignancy. Polyamine levels were increased in all three groups in the early postoperative period. Urinary polyamine excretion did not correlate with serum CEA levels, tumor volume, or stage of disease in patients with cancer. Because elevated levels of urinary polyamines are not specific for malignancy and do not correlate with other prognostic indicators, such measurements are unlikely to be useful in tumor detection and determining prognosis. Polyamine levels, however, may prove useful in monitoring response to therapy and detecting recurrences in individual patients."
CD011134,0,3788331,0,[Significance of carcinoembryonic antigen in the treatment of colorectal cancers].,"Carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) has been tested in numerous clinical studies, from its discovery in 1965. In the context of treatment for colorectal carcinoma, its importance is primarily related to early detection of recurrences following potentially curative operations. However, its value was found to be limited in primary diagnosis. In certain cases, second-look laparotomy may be indicated solely on the basis of rising CEA levels. Further clinical studies will have to be conducted under controlled conditions, with the view to finding out, if early detection of recurrences or metastasation is really beneficial to the patient in terms of extended survival."

Radical surgery was performed in 121 patients (mean age 66 years) with cancer Dukes' A (median diameter 3 cm), while 37 patients (mean age 71) with smaller cancers (median 2 cm) had polypectomy or local excision. Post-operative complications were significantly more frequent in the first group. No patients in any of the two groups with carcinoma in pedunculated adenomas or within the upper half of the submucosa or above 9 cm from the anal verge had recurrent cancer. CEA-measurements had no prognostic value. No difference was found in crude or cancer-related death between the two groups. The overall results support the use of local treatment in elderly patients with complicating disease, having small cancers, not penetrating the tunica muscularis externa of the rectosigmoid wall."
CD011134,0,3780447,0,[Cancer of the colon: prognostic factors].,"The course of 675 patients operated on for carcinoma of the colon was analysed in relation to various prognostically relevant factors. The most important one in case of recurrence was a negative CEA (carcino-embryonal antigen) test. In this case the five-year survival rate after a second operation was 44%, compared with 6%, if the test was positive. Radical second operation was associated with a negative CEA test in 70% of cases. The five-year survival rate after second operation in stage rT1-3 N0M0 was 26%. Patients who had regular follow-ups survived the second operation with a five-year survival rate of 11%, none survived who had been without medical follow-up. Five-year survival rate of 16% was achieved by the group of patients who were symptom-free; none with symptomatic recurrence survived. Other prognostically favourable factors were: male sex; tumour localized to the ascending colon; onset in the fifth decade; long recurrence-free interval; and early stage of the tumour at first operation."
CD011134,0,3779657,0,Preoperative imaging of colorectal carcinoma with 111In-labeled anticarcinoembryonic antigen monoclonal antibody.,"Patients with primary, recurrent, or metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma were given injections of 200 micrograms of anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monoclonal antibody labeled with 2 mCi of 111In (Indacea). Patients were imaged at 24 and 48 h. Celiotomy was performed on 40 patients between 3 and 17 days post-Indacea injection. Of 16 primary tumors, 11 (69%) were imaged. Of six extrahepatic recurrences, none was imaged. Intrahepatic metastases were visualized as negative images in 10 of 24 (42%) patients. On the basis of the activity in tissue expressed as a percentage of the total radioactive dose per kg injected into the patient (% ID/kg), extrahepatic tumors that were imaged using Indacea had a significant uptake of radiolabel in the tumor [5.99 +/- 0.91% ID/kg (SE)] and in the associated normal mesenteric lymph nodes (12.0 +/- 2.4% ID/kg). The CEA content of these tumors was high (13.3 +/- 4.7 micrograms/g), and, histologically, the CEA was located primarily apically or intraluminally. Intrahepatic tumor imaging correlated only with tumor size. The greatest Indacea uptake was seen in normal liver (22.1 +/- 3.2% ID/kg). Low Indacea uptake was seen in fat (0.21 +/- 0.05% ID/kg) and bowel wall (1.11 +/- 0.17% ID/kg). In conclusion, Indacea imaging of colorectal carcinoma is specific for high concentrations of accessible CEA in CEA-bearing tumors or in lymph nodes draining these tumors. The successful clinical use of monoclonal antibodies for tumor imaging and therapy will require careful selection of patients for a number of antigen-related parameters including antigen content and distribution in tumors. This information will only come from careful correlation between image results and tissue analysis. High uptake by normal liver tissue is the major unresolved problem with labeled antibody imaging."
CD011134,0,3756825,0,Comparing predictive decision rules in postoperative CEA monitoring.,"To evaluate the usefulness of serial postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assays, seven previously published decision rules for predicting tumor recurrence were compared retrospectively using CEA values from 214 patients followed 36 to 120 months after surgery for colorectal carcinoma. Decision rules employing cutoff values to predict tumor recurrence were found inadequate for the asymptomatic patient. This attenuation of prognostic usefulness appeared attributable to inadequacies of CEA assays for predicting late recurrences. From these analyses, elevated CEA results without other objective evidence might be insufficient to justify second-look surgery. In addition, late recurring tumors tended not to cause elevated CEA levels."
CD011134,0,3742993,0,Diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer is an important disease with high mortality. Clinical features are usually nonspecific and vary with the location of the tumor. Diagnosis depends on colonic investigations initiated by a high index of clinical suspicion. Rectal examination, sigmoidoscopy, air-contrast barium enema, and colonoscopy are the crucial diagnostic tools. Clinical judgment dictates the extent of work-up in individual symptomatic patients. Screening of asymptomatic middle-aged and elderly persons is widely advised but less widely practiced. More evidence is needed to clarify the value of screening, especially by occult blood testing. CEA testing is unsuitable for screening and of only limited value for monitoring patients with known colorectal cancer. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment. Radiotherapy is useful for palliation of rectal cancer and may delay postoperative tumor recurrence. Chemotherapy for disseminated disease generally gives disappointing results, since only a minority of tumors respond and survival benefit is marginal. Periodic colonic surveillance is important after tumor resection, primarily to detect premalignant new growths."
CD011134,0,3736057,0,Seven cases of pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection for locally recurrent rectal cancer.,"Local recurrence of rectal cancer following abdominoperineal resection is rarely amenable to limited resection. Carcinoembryonic antigen assay is valuable for diagnosing most recurrent rectal cancers, but it is inadequate for early detection. Pelvic computed tomography examination is very valuable for the early detection and localization of recurrence in relation to pelvic structures and can also serve as a guide in percutaneous needle biopsy of the tumor. Seven patients with deeply invading recurrent lesions underwent pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection. The ileal segment conduit was used for ureteral urinary diversion. The mean operation time and blood loss were 8.8 hours and 6,200 ml, respectively. No operative deaths were encountered. One patient is alive 22 months postoperatively with no evidence of disease, and another patient is alive 32 months postoperatively with pelvic wall recurrence. This procedure seems a reasonable treatment for palliation and full recovery in certain patients."

Preoperative CEA levels were correlated with Dukes' stages, however, the preoperative CEA value was of limited value as a screening procedure. In 42 patients with tumor recurrence after radical resection, a diagnosis of relapse, based on a rise in the CEA concentration, preceded the positive clinical symptoms. Analysis of the CEA time course made it possible to differentiate local tumor recurrence and generalized metastasis, regardless of the histologic type or primary site of the tumor."

Normalization of an increased preoperative serum CEA level indicated, however, nearly always the radical character of the intervention. Critically high (above 30 ng/per ml) CEA value observed in Dukes' stages C and D can be considered bad prognostic signs. Patients like these died within one year.

Preoperative levels of C.E.A. appear to be related to Dukes staging of the disease.

CD011134,0,3707331,0,Colonoscopy after curative resection of colorectal cancer.,"Colonoscopy is generally considered to be an important part of the follow-up program for patients who have undergone curative resection of colorectal cancer. However, there are few data available concerning the frequency with which colonoscopy should be performed and for what length of time after operation. Since 1978, our policy has been to examine the colon annually in these patients using colonoscopy alternating with barium enema. We have evaluated the results in 100 patients over a four-year period. Based on size and histology, the significant colonoscopic findings were new colon cancers in three patients and 11 polyps demonstrating increased risk for malignancy in nine patients. This represents an interval yield of 3% per year. From these results and other reports, we recommend that these patients undergo total colonoscopy in the perioperative period to identify and remove synchronous lesions of the colon, and that examination of the remaining colon should be performed annually, preferably with colonoscopy, for at least the first four years after curative resection."

Three groups were evaluated. In group 1, CEA elevation alone was the indication for the exploration in 13 asymptomatic patients. In group 2, 13 other asymptomatic patients underwent exploration because of elevated CEA levels in combination with other findings. In group 3, ten patients were symptomatic with an elevated CEA level at the time of exploration. Five patients from groups 1 and 2 underwent a curative resection for recurrent tumor (14 per cent). Three of these patients are still alive more than five years after exploration. Nine patients had negative findings at exploration for tumor recurrence (25 per cent false-positive results). Six of these patients are alive while three have died of metastatic disease. Twenty-two of the 36 patients (61 per cent) had unresectable disease at the time of exploration. Four of these patients underwent some form of surgical palliative procedure. Considering the five patients who underwent a curative resection with the latter four patients, this results in 25 per cent of the patients benefitting from surgical exploration."

CD011134,0,3699082,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and alkaline phosphatase in progressive colorectal cancer with special reference to patient survival.,"The prognostic value of serial CEA tests was evaluated in 175 consecutive patients with progressive colorectal cancer who subsequently died of their disease. The upper normal plasma CEA limit was determined to be 8 ng/ml from serial CEA determinations in 31 patients radically operated on for colorectal cancer and observed in median 40 months without evidence of recurrence. A CEA value of greater than 8 ng/ml was highly suggestive of residual disease or recurrence, even when no clinical evidence was present. Approximately 90% of the patients dying from colorectal cancer showed an increase in CEA to greater than 8 ng/ml during the course of the disease. In 63% of the patients CEA increase preceded clinical progression or relapse, with a median time period of 4 months. Sixty-eight per cent of the patients had rising CEA values over an extended time period of many months, 14% had a preterminal increase, 13% had constantly normal and 5% constantly elevated CEA. As 6/9 patients developed a drop in CEA in relation to initiation of chemotherapy without clinical response, it is concluded that CEA is not a reliable indicator of clinical response to chemotherapy. Patients with liver metastases had higher CEA and alkaline phosphatase levels than patients with only localized disease. However, no good statistical correlation between CEA and serum alkaline phosphatase was found in patients with liver metastases (coefficient of correlation r = 0.35). An increase in CEA from normal to above 8 ng/ml predicted a decrease in survival time of median 60% counted from the time of diagnosis. The numerical CEA value was predictive of shortening of survival only when greater than 3000 ng/ml. Such high values were observed only in a minority of the patients (12%). Greater than 1000 U/l (27% of the patients) alkaline phosphatase predicted an extremely poor prognosis, with a median survival of 1 month (range 0.5-4 months). It is concluded that a rise in CEA to greater than 8 ng/ml indicates with high degree of certainty relapse or disease progression in colorectal cancer patients. CEA is not a reliable indicator of clinical response to chemotherapy, and an increase in the CEA level is of little prognostic value concerning survival. Alkaline phosphatase seems to be a more valuable predictor of a worsening of prognosis."

In 65 of 73 patients the CEA increase preceded the recognition of recurrence and in 14 patients the diagnosis could be confirmed only by a second-look operation. Patients with metastases (91.3%) showed CEA elevation more often than those with locoregional recurrence (71.4%).

There was 1 partial response, 1 mixed response and 1 patient with stable disease, whilst 17 patients had progressive disease. Median survival was 15.5 months. Survival was significantly shorter when the extent of hepatic disease was greater than 25% (P = 0.05), extrahepatic disease was extensive (P less than 0.005), alkaline phosphatase level was greater than 2 X normal (P less than 0.02), or performance status was less than 100% (P less than 0.001). Toxicity consisting mainly of fever, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss was serious in group I and minimal in group II. Administration of rIFN alpha A led to a ""short lived"" augmentation of natural killer (NK) cell activity. In the cyclically treated group this was a recurrent phenomenon whereas a marked lasting depression of NK cell activity was seen in chronically treated patients. Interferon-gamma production capacity was significantly stimulated during rIFN alpha A therapy. The differences in toxicity and immunostimulatory effects between the two schedules may be of importance in the design of further studies."

Useful additional clinical information-not available by CT, ultrasonics or serum levels of tumor markers-was obtained in 17 out of 52 patients (= 33%). From these results it seems obvious that antibodies used for radioimmunoscintigraphy should be selected on the basis of immunohistochemistry."
CD011134,0,3531728,0,An unusual presentation of colon cancer.,A rare case of asymptomatic cancer of the ascending colon presenting as a subcutaneous groin mass is reported. At the time of right hemicolectomy with resection of the groin mass there was no sign of incontinuity spread or lymph blockage. Sequential determination of carcinoembryonic antigen levels (CEA) in serum reflected the reduction in tumor mass after surgery as well as subsequent recurrences of disease in the groin and in the lung after 2 years. Immunoperoxidase staining of the primary tumor and the metastases showed strong positivity for CEA confirming the origin of the serum CEA. There have been no signs of liver involvement. The route of spread of this unusual metastasis is not known.

An attempt was made to formulate a consensus on issues of importance in future collaborative research. A staging system was proposed that was though to be usable by clinicians. The eligibility requirements for surgical resection of hepatic metastases and for the nonsurgical treatment of hepatic metastases is discussed. Criteria for the response to treatment were formulated. The selection of appropriate control groups for new treatment strategies was discussed.
CD011134,0,3518912,0,Postoperative radiotherapy in Dukes' B and C carcinoma of the rectum and rectosigmoid. A randomized multicenter study.,"Results obtained during the first 5 years of a randomized study of postoperative radiotherapy (50 Gy) are presented. Criteria for randomization were fulfilled in 494 of 861 patients with Dukes' B and C tumors, when the trial was closed. Severe complications from radiotherapy approximated 10%. Probability of survival without local failure within 24 months was significantly higher after radiotherapy in patients with Dukes' C tumors, and the time of local failure was delayed 1 year. Patients with Dukes' B tumors had no benefit from radiotherapy. Risks of distant metastases and death were not influenced by radiotherapy in the main groups. Plasma-CEA measurements were evaluated blindly, and radiotherapy changed the critical levels of CEA for detection of recurrent cancer. It was concluded that patients with Dukes' C tumors may benefit from radiotherapy and plasma-CEA levels are influenced by radiotherapy, which may be important, when these are used in screening for recurrent cancer."
CD011134,0,3515109,0,[Radioimmunologic determination of beta 2-microglobulin and carcinoembryonic antigen in the diagnosis of recurrences of rectal cancer].,The paper is concerned with the results of the determination of beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-MG) and CEA concentrations in rectal cancer patients to improve diagnosis of recurrences. The CEA content was shown to be the most specific indicator reflecting the course of a recurring tumor process whereas the beta 2-MG test was found inappropriate for the purpose though it might be used in suspected involvement of the urinary organs in a tumor process.
CD011134,0,3510834,0,Immunoperoxidase staining of carcinoembryonic antigen as a prognostic indicator in colorectal carcinoma.,"Immunoperoxidase staining for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was performed on 192 colorectal carcinomas to determine: whether tissue staining can be substituted for preoperative serum CEA levels, and whether patient survival can be predicted by these parameters. The overall incidence of positive tissue staining was 75 percent, which was similar to the elevated serum level percentage of 73 percent. Both the serum CEA level and the CEA tissue stain correlated with patient survival in Dukes' stage C patients. There was no correlation between tissue CEA stain and tumor differentiation. Positive tissue stain and elevated preoperative serum CEA identified patients with poor prognosis in Dukes' stage D only. This study shows that tissue staining with immunoperoxidase may be substituted for preoperative serum levels for CEA. The combination of these two parameters, however, does not identify patients at greater risk for recurrence than either procedure alone."
CD011134,0,3510056,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen.,"The level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is often elevated in the serum of patients with cancer. This article reviews the clinical usefulness of this observation. Carcinoembryonic antigen is not useful for detecting asymptomatic cancer; its sensitivity and specificity are not high, particularly for early stages of disease, so in populations with low prevalence of disease there are many false-positive and false-negative results. Similarly, the antigen level cannot, by itself, provide enough diagnostic certainty to confirm or rule out suspected cancer. For some cancers, antigen levels at the time of diagnosis provide more precise prognosis than staging alone, but this information does not lead to more effective treatment. Serial measurement of CEA levels after surgery in patients with colorectal cancer can detect recurrences early, but few lives can be saved by this approach. Thus, CEA assays provide accurate information about some aspects of cancer but rarely lead to better outcomes for patients."
CD011134,0,3484753,0,Detection of colorectal carcinoma by emission-computerized tomography after injection of 123I-labeled Fab or F(ab')2 fragments from monoclonal anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibodies.,"This clinical study was based on experimental results obtained in nude mice grafted with human colon carcinoma, showing that injected 131I-labeled F(ab')2 and Fab fragments from high affinity anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monoclonal antibodies (MAb) gave markedly higher ratios of tumor to normal tissue localization than intact MAb. 31 patients with known colorectal carcinoma, including 10 primary tumors, 13 local tumor recurrences, and 21 metastatic involvements, were injected with 123I-labeled F(ab')2 (n = 14) or Fab (n = 17) fragments from MAb anti-CEA. The patients were examined by emission-computerized tomography (ECT) at 6, 24, and sometimes 48 h after injection using a rotating dual head scintillation camera. All 23 primary tumors and local recurrences except one were clearly visualized on at least two sections of different tomographic planes. Interestingly, nine of these patients had almost normal circulating CEA levels, and three of the visualized tumors weighed only 3-5 g. Among 19 known metastatic tumor involvements, 14 were correctly localized by ECT. Two additional liver and several bone metastases were discovered by immunoscintigraphy. Altogether, 86% of the tumor sites were detected, 82% with F(ab')2 and 89% with Fab fragments. The contrast of the tumor images obtained with Fab fragments suggests that this improved method of immunoscintigraphy has the potential to detect early tumor recurrences and thus to increase the survival of patients. The results of this retrospective study, however, should be confirmed in a prospective study before this method can be recommended for the routine diagnosis of cancer."

CD011134,0,3462448,1,[Determination of carcinoembryonic and carbohydrate antigens in the diagnosis of recurrences and metastases of rectal cancer].,"A study was made of the results of measuring the carcinoembryonic and carbohydrate antigens using a kit of reagents in 75 patients with rectal cancer recurrences and metastases. The concentration of these antigens in healthy persons was for CEA 6.4 +/- 0.71 micrograms/l, the carbohydrate antigen--19.6 +/- 2.51 units/ml. In this group of patients rectal cancer local recurrence was found in 52, metastases to the liver in 19 and metastatic involvement of the liver and lungs in 4. An elevated level of the CEA was detected in 92.8% of the patients with cancer recurrence (the mean concentration was 99.9 +/- 9.29 micrograms/l), and in 100% of the patients with metastases (the mean concentration was 193.4 +/- 30.42 micrograms/l). The content of the carbohydrate antigen in cancer recurrences was raised in 21.3% of the cases only, in metastases to the liver in 31.6% and in 2 patients with metastatic liver and lung involvement. Thus, measuring the CEA content turned out to be the most specific and sensitive test for the diagnosis of rectal cancer recurrences and metastases. The use of the carbohydrate antigen for this purpose was found ineffective."
CD011134,0,3461200,0,Multiparameter evaluation of the expression in situ of normal and tumor-associated antigens in human colorectal carcinoma.,"The immunoreactivity of a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) was studied in a series of patients with colorectal carcinomas to test the association of antigen expression with other parameters such as histopathologic stage, differentiation, and clinical outcome. Low-level binding to normal tissue and high-level binding to malignant tissue were observed with MoAb defining, respectively, a gastrointestinal cancer antigen (GICA), Leb (distal colon only), A, H type 2 antigen, X-like antigen, and the 200-kilodalton (Kd) protein of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The degree of histologic differentiation correlated with the expression of Lea antigen, A, and Y haptens, whereas a progressive loss of these antigens coincided with loss of differentiation. Two undifferentiated carcinomas expressed only two, H type 2 antigen and a highly glycosylated protein of 20-50 Kd, of the 14 antigens investigated. An interesting, but not significant, association between Leb antigen expression and more extensive disease was found: Whereas 71% of Dukes C tumors were positive for Leb, only 48% of patients with Dukes A and B2 tumors showed the presence of Leb antigen. On the other hand, the presence of B72.3-defined antigen is significantly associated with an earlier stage of disease. Chi-square tests to assess the association of antigen positivity with disease recurrence indicated a significant binding association with tumor recurrence over a broad range of percent positive cells for two MoAb defining different determinants of GICA. Similar associations, but over a narrow range of positive cells, were found for H type 2 antigen and the 200-Kd protein of CEA."
CD011134,0,3459133,1,[Clinical evaluation of the tumor marker CA 19-9 in comparison with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in surgical pre- and postoperative diagnosis].,"A new tumor marker (CA 19-9) was investigated. CA 19-9 is a tumor-associated antigen which is detected by a monoclonal antibody. CA 19-9 (CIS-Centocor) was compared simultaneously with CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) in 347 patients. 123 patients with gastrointestinal tumors showed a sensitivity of 31% for CA 19-9 (CEA 49%), combination increased sensitivity to 58%. The highest sensitivity was found in pancreas carcinoma (CA 19-9 75%, CEA 66%, combination 92%); it was lower in gastric, colon, and oesophagus carcinomas. In relapsed colorectal carcinomas sensitivity was 53% (CEA 78%, combination 85%). In cases of relapse, tumor markers may become positive even if they were not detectable before resection of the primary tumor. Specificity for CA 19-9 was 100% (CEA 84%) compared to a group of non-malignant diseases including patients with inflammations and patients with nicotin abuse (n = 102). Because of its high specificity and superior sensitivity to CEA in pancreas carcinomas CA 19-9 should be determined in primary and relapse diagnosis in combination with CEA."
CD011134,0,3024422,0,[Experiences with determining carcinoembryonic antigen in tumors of the digestive tract].,"CEA levels (CEA = carcino-embryonic antigen) were checked as indicators for the presence of malignant diseases of the gastro-intestinal tract. Tests were applied to 1,102 blood samples, including 1,012 relating to malignant alterations of the digestive tract and 32 relating to benign changes. Sixty-eight samples were taken from tumours localised elsewhere. The importance is stressed of high-continuity observation of CEA levels which have proved to enable dimensional assessment of colorectal carcinoma. Presurgical and postsurgical CEA values can be related to surgical radicality. Regular postoperative monitoring is recommended for prognostication, early detection of recurrences, and early assessment of spreading of the disease."
CD011134,0,2943876,0,Hepatic arterial infusion with floxuridine and cisplatin: overriding importance of antitumor effect versus degree of tumor burden as determinants of survival among patients with colorectal cancer.,"Cisplatin (CDDP) was combined with floxuridine (FUDR) and delivered into the hepatic arteries of 29 patients as induction therapy for colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver. Mitomycin C and FUDR combination was substituted after progression or when response had peaked. Chemotherapy was delivered with an Infusaid pump (Infusaid Corp; Norwood, Mass; 14 patients), Medtronic programmable drug administration device (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis; two patients), or percutaneously placed catheters (13 patients). Complete disappearance of liver metastases was observed in four patients and 11 additional patients had a partial remission as determined by computed tomography (CT) scan and substantiated at times by angiography, for a total response rate of 52%. Response as determined by imaging techniques coincided with a concurrent decrease in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and improvement in performance status. The severity of tumor burden was correlated with the response to therapy and survival. Among those patients who responded to arterial chemotherapy, differences in disease severity did not significantly influence survival. Median survival among responders with greater than 25% liver replacement by tumor was 14 months (P = .28), compared with 28 months for those patients with less than 25% liver replacement. In contrast, differences in tumor burden significantly affected survival among patients who failed to respond to chemotherapy; median survival among nonresponding patients with greater than 25% liver replacement was 4 months, compared with 8 months for those who had less than 25% liver replacement (P = .01). The presence of minimal extrahepatic disease at the time of initiation of intraarterial treatment did not seem to have a significant detrimental effect on survival. The study suggests that hepatic tumor response to arterial administration of CDDP and FUDR and mitomycin C and FUDR is clinically significant because it overrides the effect of tumor burden on survival among patients who have colorectal cancer with liver metastases and may offer effective palliation."

The patients had all undergone resection for their primary tumors and in six instances subsequent resections for hepatic metastases. Initial CA 19-9 levels were greater than or equal to 37 U/mL in 22 of the 53 patients (41%) and in 68% of the patients with metastatic disease. Similar trends of serial CA 19-9 and CEA levels were found in 79% of the 53 patients. One patient with initially normal CEA levels had elevated CA 19-9 levels from the start. In ten of the 53 patients (19%), serial CA 19-9 levels remained low despite tumor recurrence or progression, and despite increasing CEA levels above 5 ng/mL. The increasing serial CEA trends predicted recurrence in 88% and increasing CA 19-9 trends in 50% of cases, which was increased to 70% by including trends of CA 19-9 levels below 37 U/mL. Following hepatic lobectomy, both serial CEA and CA 19-9 levels decreased rapidly. Used alone, serial CA 19-9 levels did not appear to be as sensitive as standard CEA in this retrospective study of selected patients."

CD011134,0,4075992,1,[Carcinoembryonic antigen: diagnosis and tumor progression in gastrointestinal tumors].,Tumour progression in 340 patients with resected gastrointestinal primary tumours was monitored using the gradual increase in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in serum. The commencement of the rise in CEA generally preceded clinical detection of the cancer by several months. The degree to which the rise in CEA correlated with the recurrence of cancer was investigated. There was a marked difference in the distribution of the rises in CEA between local tumour growth and distant metastases. CEA increases of more than 1 microgram CEA/l serum in 10 days occurred exclusively in patients with distant metastases. There was a further marked difference in the distribution of the CEA increase between the group with liver metastases and the groups with peritoneal carcinomatosis or other metastases. The site of the primary tumour had no influence on the CEA increase during formation of metastases.
CD011134,0,4073358,0,Intraoperative radioimmunodetection of colorectal tumor with a hand-held radiation detector.,"A hand-held gamma detection probe was used intraoperatively to localize primary and recurrent colorectal tumors in 28 patients 48 to 72 hours after they received an intravenous injection of 2.2 mCi of iodine-131 labeled anticarcinoembryonic antigen polyclonal baboon antibody. Preoperative evaluation included determination of serum carcinoembryonic antigen, barium enema, colonoscopy, chest film, computerized axial tomography, liver, spleen, and bone scans, and endoscopy when indicated. Preoperative whole-body imaging correctly localized primary tumors in only 33 percent of the patients, whereas it correctly demonstrated tumor in 64 percent of those with recurrent disease. Intraoperative tumor-to-background ratios derived from the detector probe were elevated in all patients, averaging 3.97:1 in primary lesions and 4.18:1 in recurrent tumors. Postoperatively, carcinoembryonic antigen was localized in tissues with the avidin-biotin peroxidase staining technique to confirm intraoperative readings. Variations in stain uptake in a patient could be correlated with variations in radiation detector readings in the same patient. Results support our previous work in nude mice, demonstrating the improved sensitivity and specificity of the hand-held gamma detection device over whole-body imaging for intraoperative localization of immunoradiolabeled tumors."

In 31 normal volunteers and in 31 patients with histologically documented colorectal tumor, we measured serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), ferritin, anionic glycoproteins, and their sialic acid content (SA). CEA, ferritin, anionic glycoproteins and SA mean levels were significantly higher in patients than in normal subjects. Among the four markers CEA was the most sensitive (87.1%) and SA the most specific (100%). By using CEA and SA in combination in 29 out of 31 patients, either marker was abnormally high. Ferritin and anionic glycoproteins did not render additional information. CEA serum levels were elevated in 14 out of 15 patients with liver metastasis, while SA was elevated in six out of 15. CEA maintains its central cole as tumor marker in colorectal cancer; the combined use of CEA and SA may add to precision in detecting patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Anionic glycoproteins and ferritin seem of limited usefulness."
CD011134,0,4048893,1,[Prospective follow-up study of radically resected colorectal carcinoma. Status after 5 years].,"207 patients curatively resected for colorectal cancer have been followed up in a prospective, controlled study using serial CEA, ultrasound, colonoscopy and clinical examination for early detection of recurrent tumor. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 52 recurrences (25%) have been detected, rising CEA value being the most sensitive indicator (86%) among the diagnostic procedures. 26 patients were reoperated for recurrent disease; in 10 out of 19 patients with local and 3 out of 7 patients with distant recurrence a potentially curative resection was possible. Median survival of patients not operated upon (n = 26) or incompletely resected (n = 13) is 8.5 months, whereas median survival for the 13 patients reoperated for cure has not yet been reached at 2 1/2 years. With respect to resectability, thorough clinical examination and endoscopy have been the most sensitive examinations (both 44%). Aggressive follow-up for suitable patients with colorectal cancer will detect most of the recurrences in an early asymptomatic phase, increase the rate of resectability and prolong survival in selected, curatively reresected cases."

CD011134,0,4037904,0,CEA-directed second-look surgery in the asymptomatic patient after primary resection of colorectal carcinoma.,"Since 1971, serial carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels have been measured to monitor patients after primary resection of colorectal cancer. Based solely on a rise in CEA level above the baseline established after primary resection, 146 patients were readmitted to the hospital. Chest films, liver-spleen scan, colonoscopy, bone scan, abdominal and pelvic CAT scan, and hepatic arteriograms were performed, and elevated CEA levels were confirmed before reexploration was undertaken. In the 146 patients, 139 (95%) had recurrences, and 81 (58%) of these were resectable for potential cure. Two of the first 22 patients re-explored between 1971 and 1975 are still living 11 and 14 years after second look; of 45 patients reoperated upon from 1976 through 1979 and followed for at least 5 years, 14 (31%) are still living. A rise in CEA above the baseline established after primary resection proved to be a sensitive indicator of recurrence and prompted reexploration before symptoms developed. Early alternative therapy was begun in patients with unresectable recurrences."
CD011134,0,4017165,0,A phase II study of sequential methotrexate and fluorouracil in advanced colorectal cancer.,"Twenty-nine patients with advanced colorectal cancer were treated with methotrexate (MTX) 200 mg/m2 followed 1 h later by fluorouracil (FU) (1000 mg/m2) and 24 h later by oral leucovorin 20 mg every 6 h for six doses. The cycle was repeated every 2 weeks. Among the 25 evaluable patients there were 2 complete responses (confirmed by liver scan) and 5 partial responses. Although hematological toxicity was mild, there were four episodes of nonfatal sepsis. The majority of patients developed an erythematous scaly rash on the palms and soles plus eye irritation after six courses of chemotherapy. In addition, the sequential MTX-FU had to be discontinued in 6 of the 7 responders because of (a) severe chills, (b) severe hyperpigmentation, or (c) neurologic complications (ataxic gait or disorientation). These results indicate that this sequential MTX-FU has modest activity in colorectal cancer but is associated with moderately severe toxicity. Only randomized trials of FU alone versus sequential MTX-FU can determine whether sequential MTX-FU has a therapeutic advantage over FU alone in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer."

Among 45 patients with colorectal carcinomas, 51% showed CEA levels in the pathologic range before therapy, those with metastatic disease from well differentiated adenocarcinomas showed the higher values. Measurement of the circulating levels of this CEA fraction proved to be more useful in the monitoring of the course of disease during and after antineoplastic treatment. Sensitivity of the radioimmunoassay technique for the remaining digestive cancers was over 50%, but pathologic CEA values are not exclusive for malignant digestive disease, since 22% of patients with benign diseases also showed raised serum levels of CEA."
CD011134,0,3992446,0,Unresectable hepatic metastases from carcinoma of the colon and rectum.,"To alter the dismal prognosis of multiple unresectable metastases to the liver from carcinoma of the colon and rectum, 30 patients underwent hepatic dearterialization (ligation of the hepatic artery, transection of hepatic ligaments and cholecystectomy) and distal hepatic artery cannulation with prolonged infusion chemotherapy by a portable infusion pump followed by systemic intravenous chemotherapy. Involvement of the liver by carcinoma was less than 50 per cent in 16 and more than 50 per cent in 14 patients. The results of follow-up examinations, LFT, CEA and CT scan studies showed more than 50 per cent regression of the tumor and a decrease in alkaline phosphatase values and CEA in 29 patients (97 per cent); six had complete regression of tumor. The duration of response ranged from five to 39 months with the median of 17 or more months. The results of sequential LFT showed immediate increase in liver enzymes with return to normal in seven to 14 days. The mean CEA value decreased by 69 per cent within the first week and further decreased by 88 per cent in two months at the end of infusion chemotherapy. The over-all and adjusted survival rates from diagnosis were 79 and 91 per cent at 12 months; 56 and 81 per cent at 18 months, and 40 and 65 per cent at 24 months. The over-all and adjusted median survival rate after the treatment was 17 and 23 months, respectively. Of the 14 patients who failed this program, 11 had recurrences at sites other than the liver, with hepatic disease in remission in the majority. Of the 17 patients who died, six died of causes unrelated to the recurrence of disease. Thus, hepatic dearterialization and infusion regional chemotherapy can ""effectively"" control the hepatic disease and increase over-all survival time from three to six months to 23 months. However, recurrences of extrahepatic carcinoma and other causes are responsible for death and the over-all guarded prognosis."
CD011134,0,3988951,0,Mucosal abnormalities at the anastomosis site in patients who have had intestinal resection for colonic cancer.,"Twenty eight patients with colonic cancer, who were asymptomatic after intestinal resection and anastomosis, underwent colonoscopy as part of their routine follow up, and biopsies were obtained from the anastomosis and several other sites. Sections were stained by haematoxylin and eosin, several methods for mucin, and by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method for carcinoembryonic antigen. Non-specific inflammatory changes were seen at the anastomosis in 11 of the 28 cases, apparent in several two years after operation; focal surface ulceration was seen in over half these samples. Neither dysplastic nor adenomatous change was detected, but at seven anastomoses the so called transitional change, which has been regarded as a preneoplastic change, was apparent. There was no consistent alteration in carcinoembryonic antigen reactivity. It is concluded that there is morphological evidence of a continued stimulus to regenerative activity at some anastomoses and that this may represent a promoting factor enhancing further carcinogenesis."

Value of various diagnostic methods.,"The authors reviewed 51 cases of local recurrence after sphincter-saving resection for rectal and rectosigmoid carcinoma to assess the sensitivity of current diagnostic procedures. A combination of follow-up serum CEA levels and rectoscopy was found to be most efficient during the first two years after surgery in terms of the time, frequency, and location of the recurrence as well as the cost-benefit ratio. On the other hand, almost all recurrent lesions developed extraluminally, infiltrating the suture line secondarily; moreover, one fourth extended outside the bowel wall. Thus in addition to endoscopy, CT is useful as a means of defining the entire mass at the anastomosis as well as detecting pericolic recurrence and is essential if repeat resection is contemplated."
CD011134,0,3982037,0,Diagnosis and operation for locally recurrent rectal cancer.,"Local recurrence of rectal cancer following abdominoperineal resection is rarely amenable to limited resection. Six patients with deeply invading recurrent lesions had pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection. This procedure seems a reasonable treatment for palliation and the chance of cure in selected patients. In order to select good candidates for this extensive procedure, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assays and the diagnosis of locally recurrent tumor with pelvic computed tomography (CT) were evaluated. CEA assay is valuable for diagnosing most recurrent rectal cancers, but it is inadequate for early detection. A high CEA level often indicates extrapelvic tumor spread. CT examination is very valuable for the early detection and localization of recurrence in relation to pelvic structures."
CD011134,0,3971300,0,Colon carcinoma in children and adolescents. A review of 30 cases.,"Carcinoma of the large bowel is rare in persons under the age of 30, and generally presents with advanced stages of disease. From 1964 to 1984, 30 patients presented with nonfamilial large bowel malignancies. Seventeen patients were male, and 13 female (age range, 8-25 years). In 15 patients the primary was in the right transverse colon. In 26 patients the lesion was above the peritoneal reflection. Classification by Dukes' staging demonstrated Stage B in 3 patients, Stage C in 7 patients, and Stage D in 20 patients. Twenty-five patients had a mucinous variety of adenocarcinoma. Surgery at initial laparotomy consisted of biopsy (10 patients), palliative segmental resection (7 patients) and complete resection (13 patients; survival in each of these groups ranged from 1 to 15 months (median, 6 months), 6 to 36 months (median, 8 months) and 7 months to 14 years (median, 6 months), respectively. The only long-term survivors are three patients who had complete resection, two of whom are surviving free of disease after 5 and 15 years, respectively. Common sites of abdominal recurrence were the omentum (6 patients) and ovaries (7 patients). All patients received chemotherapy. In 16 of 24 evaluable patients, responses lasting 3 to 18 months were observed. Five patients also received radiation therapy. Follow-up of these patients included computed tomographic scans, ultrasound, and determination of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. The CEA level in 9 of 23 patients did not correspond with the presence of either residual disease or progression of disease. Chemotherapy combined with a second-look surgical procedure in selected cases may improve the proportion of patients surviving and the duration of survival."
CD011134,0,3971297,1,Results of a 400-patient carcinoembryonic antigen second-look colorectal cancer study.,"Four hundred patients with resectable colon and rectal cancers were operated on by 37 surgeons at 31 institutions. Patients were monitored with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level determinations and clinical examinations. One hundred thirty patients had recurrences, and 75 were reoperated on, with 43 reoperations CEA-directed and 32 clinically directed. Two of 75 died within 1 month after the second operation. Twenty-two second-look patients remain free of disease 5 years after their second operation. The highest resectability of recurrent cancer occurred in patients with a CEA level below 11 ng/ml in whom the CEA level was determined at intervals of 1 to 2 months."
CD011134,0,3970315,1,Eighty-four potential second-look operations based on sequential carcinoembryonic antigen determinations and clinical investigations in patients with recurrent gastrointestinal cancer.,"In our study of patients with resected primary gastrointestinal cancer, slope analysis of the post-operatively increasing carcinoembryonic antigen time courses signaled relapse in about 80 percent of the patients up to 12 months before positive clinical diagnosis. In 29 patients, clinical confirmation of the relapse could be obtained only after second-look surgery. Slope analysis generally differentiated localized from metastatic disease and therefore also predicted the site of relapse. A first evaluation of 84 patients with potential cases of second-look operations provided evidence for a significant increase in survival. Recently, the evaluation of individual carcinoembryonic antigen doubling times was used to derive an individual prognosis since doubling times strongly correlated with the survival of untreated patients. On this basis, it was clearly possible to show the benefit of second-look operation, since patients with resectable recurrences exhibited longer survival times compared with patients with similar carcinoembryonic antigen doubling times without treatment. Moreover, the introduction of monoclonal antibodies with increased specificity for malignant states, has facilitated the selection of patients for second-look operation because unspecific carcinoembryonic antigen elevations are less frequent and recurrent disease can be predicted more reliably due to the higher carcinoembryonic antigen increments associated with malignant growth."
CD011134,0,3918217,1,Detection of recurrent cancer of the colon and rectum.,"Outpatient follow-up in patients operated upon due to carcinoma of the colon and rectum is usually performed, due to a high rate of recurrence and with the aim of finding a curable recurrence. Due to the enormous cost of an extended follow-up system, a careful evaluation of the benefit is needed. The aim of the present investigation was to study the efficacy of the different tools in an extended follow-up. One hundred ninety patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum were--apart from traditional clinical follow-up--followed with an extensive laboratory battery including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hemoglobin (Hb), electrophoresis, ALP, and GT. Forty-seven recurrences were found. Thirty-one of these recurrences were first detected by a rise in CEA. Seven cases were detected at clinical follow-up and six cases due to symptoms suggestive of recurrence. The predictive value of a positive test was 79.4% for CEA but very low for the other tests studied. A negative value for any of the tests in the battery was usually accurate. Follow-up after colorectal carcinoma should include CEA as the only laboratory parameter. Postoperative colonoscopy for removal of missed synchronous lesions, chest X-ray, and endoscopic investigations of the anastomotic region also seem to be of value."
CD011134,0,3916663,0,Role of carcinoembryonic antigen assay in the management of cancer.,"CEA is a molecule produced by a large number of malignant and benign tissues. Measuring levels of CEA circulating in the blood by radioimmunoassay can be used in the management of cancer patients. Because of high false positive and false negative percentages in normal populations, it has not been useful in screening for malignancy. However, in several types of cancer patients the test has been shown to be of considerable clinical value. Elevated CEA levels indicate a poor prognosis in patients with primary colorectal cancer, primary pancreatic cancer, primary breast cancer, and primary lung cancer. Serial CEA titers obtained following cancer treatments can be used to monitor the therapy. CEA can assess the adequacy of surgical removal of a primary colon or rectal cancer, monitor responses to chemotherapy, and assess response to radiation therapy. The greatest clinical impact of CEA has been in the detection of recurrent colon or rectal cancer following surgical resection of the primary malignancy. Early detection of recurrence, when combined with reoperative second-look surgery, may result in 30% long-term survivors."

CD011134,0,3903552,0,Comparison of a CEA-EIA assay based on monoclonal antibody with a CEA-RIA assay with polyclonal antiserum.,"A monoclonal CEA-EIA assay is evaluated with respect to clinically pertinent data. Comparison is done with the conventional CEA-RIA assay (Roche). Good interlaboratory reproducibility was found, and the stability was very good over the one year evaluation period. The EIA assay could be performed in samples of serum and plasma with compatible results. The correlation between the EIA and RIA values was different in different diagnostic groups, with high correlation in colo-rectal cancer, and low in non-malignant diseases, in which the EIA assay had a lower frequency of CEA positive values. In colo-rectal cancer the RIA assay shows a 20% specificity improvement compared with the EIA assay. This was also reflected in better predictability for true positive and true negative cancer diagnosis in this group of patients as well as increased ability to discriminate between malignant and non-malignant diseases. In other groups of patients, like lung cancer and uterine cervical cancer, such improvement was not seen. The discrimination between malignant and non-malignant diseases was comparable to that of the RIA assay. In follow-up series the EIA and RIA assays detected recurrences and responses to treatment in a quite similar way. In most cases of recurrences from colo-rectal cancer, however, the EIA values increased faster and were a better indicator for recurrent disease than the RIA values."

CD011134,0,3897618,0,[Clinical evaluation of CEA in colorectal carcinoma].,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) titer (Dinabot-Kit) were determined in proven 177 patients with colorectal carcinoma preoperatively, and at routine intervals following operation. The assay was positive in 39.1% with stage I, II, 65.9% with III, 65.9% with IV and 85.7% with V. Elevated CEA levels were noted in those who had infiltration of cancer cells extending through the proper muscle layer. In 79.2% of curative resections CEA levels returned to normal within one month, but the titers remained elevated in 73.3% of palliative resections. Among 26 patients with recurrent disease, 16 had a hepatic metastasis showing a previous or simultaneous CEA rise, whereas 10 had a local recurrence with a slow rise or normal. In addition, a quantitative study of CEA in extracts of 87 tumors was made in order to examine the factors affecting the level of circulating CEA. There was no significant difference between the CEA contents of the tumor and its level of circulating CEA. The level of circulating CEA might be influenced by the spread cancer cells, rather than the tumor contained CEA."

Eighty-eight patients were studied preoperatively, and 79 postoperatively, before, at the time of, and after the diagnosis of relapse. The authors aimed to assess how often the GICA test failed, i.e., was false-negative in patients in whom the CEA test was true-positive and, more importantly, whether it could give diagnostic information in patients in whom the CEA test failed. Before surgery, serum GICA gave similar information to serum CEA in 56 percent of the patients: true-positive in 18 percent and false-negative in 38 percent; less information in 42 percent; and more information in only 2 percent. During the postoperative follow-up, serum GICA gave similar information to serum CEA in 55 percent of the patients: true-positive (i.e., rising persistently from a postoperative nadir) in 27 percent and false-negative in 28 percent; less information in 44 percent; and more information in only 1 percent. Therefore, this test in its present version, where both the catcher and the tracer antibody are the same, NS 19-9, is redundant."

In patients with stage I-III gastric cancer or Duckes A-C colorectal cancer, the CA 19-9 levels ranged from normal to 127 U/ml, whereas in more advanced cases it was very high. Classified by the mode of recurrence, the highest level of CA 19-9 was observed in liver metastasis. After removal of the main tumor, the CA 19-9 level declined rapidly, increasing with recurrence. Serum CA 19-9 determination in cases of gastric or colorectal cancer was useful to classify the stage of disease, developing a prognosis and identifying a recurrence."

Late stage patients, especially inoperable patients or patients in recurrence showed significantly high TPA and CEA level compared to early stage patients. Both markers were considered to be useful not only postoperative following up for recurrence but also preoperative evaluation for resectability and prognosis and postoperative evaluation for the treatment itself."

All specimens were evaluated with regard to nuclear DNA distribution as measured by flow cytometry and expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), secretory component, epithelial IgA, and HLA-DR antigens, as determined by immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections. Both the DNA distributions and the immunohistochemical staining patterns were similar in the primary and secondary tumors. These findings are in keeping with a monoclonal or oligoclonal tumor progression in advanced large bowel carcinoma."
CD011134,0,3860677,0,Determination and significance of a new carbohydrate antigen CA19-9 in digestive system cancers.,"To assess the diagnostic significance of CA19-9, the serum levels in 225 healthy subjects, 201 patients with cancers, 423 patients with benign diseases and 21 pregnant women, were determined by RIA. The mean CA19-9 level of the healthy subjects was 11.2 +/- 0.4 U/ml (range, 6-100 U/ml). Only 3.1% of them were above 37 U/ml. The CA19-9 levels were elevated above 37 U/ml in 7.9% of 293 patients with non-carcinomatous diseases of the digestive system. Among digestive system cancers, elevated levels were found in 18.2% of 11 patients with esophageal cancer, 42.7% of 68 patients with gastric cancer, 39.1% of 23 patients with colorectal cancer, 27.8% of 18 patients with primary hepatic cancer, 71.4% of 35 patients with biliary cancer, and 75% of 20 patients with pancreatic cancer. Most of the patients with levels above 100 U/ml had carcinomatous diseases. The CA19-9 positive rates for patients with gastric cancer and colorectal cancer were extremely low at stages I, II and III, while in patients at stage IV and in patients with recurrent cancer, a tendency for rapid increase in the positive rates and concentrations of CA19-9 was noted. Based on combination assay of CA19-9, CEA and ferritin, in comparison with the positive rates for CA19-9 alone, it was found that the rates were raised to 42.7% in gastric cancer, to 39.1% in colorectal cancer, and to 71.4% in biliary cancer, suggesting the simultaneous determination with these tumor markers may serve to elevate their usefulness."
CD011134,0,3856076,1,The clinical validity of circulating tumor-associated antigens CEA and CA 19-9 in primary diagnosis and follow-up of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.,"The clinical validity of monitoring the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 were investigated in 602 patients with colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic carcinomas. Sensitivity and specificity of the tests were evaluated preoperatively as well as in the postoperative follow-up for early detection of disease progression and recurrence. At a 95% level of specificity as calculated from a group of 150 patients with benign diseases, the CEA test with monoclonal antibody had a preoperative sensitivity of 39% in colorectal cancer and 21% in gastric cancer. On the other hand, CA 19-9 had a sensitivity of 19% in colorectal cancer, 21% in gastric cancer, and 89% in pancreatic cancer. In the postoperative follow-up it was found that a combination of both tumor marker tests was most profitable in gastric carcinomas, yielding an increase of sensitivity from 59%-94%, showing a high degree of complementarity. The gain in sensitivity provided by the CA 19-9 test over the CEA-test in colorectal cancer was very low. The gain in sensitivity, however, provided by the CEA test over the CA 19-9 test in pancreatic carcinoma was also very low. On the basis of these results it has to be recommended that cases with pancreatic carcinoma are to be monitored most efficiently with the CA 19-9 test, whereas in cases with colorectal cancer the CEA test should be used primarily. However, in gastric cancer the combined use of CEA and CA 19-9 represents a highly valuable basis for monitoring the course of disease."
CD011134,0,3830268,0,Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen and prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer.,"The relationship between preoperative CEA, Dukes staging and disease recurrence, was analyzed in 92 patients with colon-rectal cancer, all who underwent curative surgery. Sixty-five of the 92 patients were followed for 36 months. A significant increase in disease recurrence risk is observable starting from a preoperative CEA value of greater than 7.5 ng/ml; corresponding values as such are verified by a significant fall in the actuarial survival curve in comparison to the progress of the curves of the other two groups with lower CEA values. A statistically significant correlation between preoperative CEA and staging was not observed, while both parameters result statistically very reliable (p less than 0.001) for prognosis; preoperative CEA values, less or greater than 7.5 ng/ml can help to stratify the Dukes tumours with respect to the probability of recurrence."
CD011134,0,2996749,0,Palliation of pelvic recurrence of colorectal cancer with intra-arterial 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin.,"Twenty-one patients with inoperable colon cancer in the pelvis were treated with intra-arterial 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C, given bilaterally into the internal iliac arteries. Seventeen of the 21 patients had failed previous radiation therapy and 15 had also failed systemic intravenous chemotherapy. Eighteen of the 21 patients received intra-arterial treatments because of pelvic pain. Effect of this treatment on the pain could be evaluated in 16 patients. A measurable decrease in pain medication occurred in 8 of 16, whereas a subjective feeling of pain relief was observed in 12 of 16 patients for a mean period of 3.5 months. However, objective tumor response was considered definite only if associated with a greater than 50% decline of an elevated plasma carcinoembryonic antigen level; this was observed in 5 of 11 patients (45%). Reduction in tumor mass as measured by imaging techniques was observed in two of ten patients in whom it was evaluable. Improvement in hydronephrosis was observed in five of seven evaluable patients. Hematuria was present in 12 patients and improved in 10 of those patients. The most significant side effect of chemotherapy was perineal and gluteal skin erythema, which was observed in 36% of the patients after the first course and in 24% during the second course. This frequently escalated to cutaneous vesiculation and desquamation. This side effect was prevented by concurrent administration of steroids. Pelvic arterial infusion of 5-FU and mitomycin C can offer temporary pain relief to patients who have failed other means of therapy. Objective antitumor effects may have also resulted but were much harder to assess in this group of patients."
CD011134,0,2986820,0,CEA tissue staining in colorectal cancer patients. A way to improve the usefulness of serial serum CEA evaluation.,"The evaluation of serial plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels is one of the most important parameter used to establish the prognosis of surgically cured colorectal cancer patients. Carcinoembryonic antigen is particularly useful in the identification of recurrences and metastasis. However, to improve the usefulness of this assay, it would be helpful to accurately determine, if possible, those patients whose cancers produce CEA. The evaluation of the presence of CEA in these cancer specimens by means of immunoperoxidase staining technique does seem to improve the sensitivity of the CEA test. Fifty-seven patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgical treatment were studied. Tissue CEA evaluation was correlated with the plasma CEA levels, the pathologic stage and grade, and histologic type of the cancers. Results demonstrate that 66.6% of Dukes' B cancers, 78.9% of Dukes' C, and 77.7% of Dukes' D cancers stained positively for CEA by immunoperoxidase. Thirty of 57 patients with preoperative pathologic plasma CEA levels had positive tissue CEA, whereas 8/57 patients did not. Of patients with a well-differentiated cancer (G1), 81.4% had positive tissue CEA versus the 64% of G2 and 60% of G3 cancers. The authors conclude that the use of the immunoperoxidase stain to measure CEA in tissue, so that the CEA serum assay may be used in those patients known to produce CEA, results in a major increase in the sensitivity of the test."
CD011134,0,2939709,0,Circulating tumor markers and assessment of response to intrahepatic chemotherapy of colon carcinoma.,"To assess the change in concentrations of circulating gastrointestinal cancer-associated antigens in response to therapy, we analyzed the sera of patients with hepatic metastasis from colorectal carcinoma who were treated with intrahepatic arterial chemotherapy. Serial serum samples were assessed for the tumor-associated antigens, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the gastrointestinal cancer antigen CA 19-9. Computed axial tomographic (CAT) scans were made to assess the size of the hepatic metastasis. In 9/10 of these patients the CEA predicted tumor response within 2-6 weeks after initiation of treatment, and in 7/10 the information was supported or more dramatically demonstrated by the CA 19-9. Combining data from both tumor markers may provide a more accurate assessment of the clinical response than one antigen alone. Recurrence of hepatic metastatic growth or extrahepatic tumor also was identified by elevation of one or both circulating tumor-associated antigens prior to other laboratory or clinical evidence of tumor growth."

CD011134,0,2416441,0,Tumor markers: value and limitations in the management of cancer patients.,"Sixteen tumor markers are reviewed, and measured to the ideal: produced by the tumor cell alone absent in health and in benign disease present in all patients with a given malignancy level in the blood representative of tumor mass detectable in occult disease. The only marker that approaches the ideal is human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in gestational trophoblastic tumors. In this malignancy, the HCG level suggests the diagnosis and stage, confirms response to therapy, and predicts relapse. The three most widely used and intensely studied tumor markers are carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alphafetoprotein (AFP), and HCG. CEA cannot be used in screening for cancer, but in carcinoma of the colon its elevation preoperatively increases the likelihood of advanced disease and postoperative recurrence. Postoperatively, elevated titers are often but not invariably associated with recurrent disease. AFP and HCG are useful in the management of nonseminomatous germ cell testicular tumors. Like CEA, they cannot be used for screening. They are more likely to be increased with advancing stage, and after therapy rising levels almost always mean recurrent disease. Some markers are valuable in specific circumstances, such as calcitonin in screening for familial medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. In multiple myeloma, immunoglobulins are useful in determining the tumor mass and response to therapy. In neuroblastoma, catecholamine metabolites are useful primarily in making the diagnosis. In some malignancies, the absence of effective therapy lowers the value of the marker, as for AFP in hepatoma. The remaining markers are too unreliable or too little studied to be useful in the management of an individual patient with cancer. The purpose of this paper is to provide the clinician with an understanding of the limitations of the present tumor markers that will lead to wiser use of the tests, and to provide standards to which future tumor markers should be measured."

These aspects of CEA, GICA and TPA markers used in follow-ups for 23 patients surgically treated for Duke's stage B2 neoplasias of the colon and rectum were examined over the period 1980-1983. Each marker examined displays its own individual characteristics of sensitivity and specificity. An X-ray endoscopic confirmation is required in all cases as no single marker is sufficiently reliable to be used as a diagnostic tool on its own. It is concluded that biological markers should be used as part of a follow-up programme embracing more than one diagnostic procedure."
CD011134,0,6749100,0,[Pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection for recurrent rectal cancer. The roles of carcinoembryonic antigen and pelvic computed tomography for early detection].,"Local recurrence of rectal cancer following abdominoperineal resection is rarely amenable to limited resection. CT study of the pelvis revealed recurrent tumor images in relation to the adjacent pelvic structures. Six patients with deeply invading recurrent lesions were subjected to pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection. No postoperative deaths were encountered. The postoperative sharp drops of serum CEA levels are useful for judging the adequacy of this procedure. The follow-up status of the 6 patients is as follows, respectively: 16 months dead from pulmonary & hepatic metastasis, 11 months and 9.5 months alive without symptoms but with slightly elevated CEA level, and 5 months, 2 months and 2 weeks alive with no evidence of disease. All patients who were relieved of perineal or sciatic nerve pain are now able to walk without any assistance or trouble. Total en bloc residual pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection is a reasonable treatment for locally recurrent rectal cancer."

William Beaumont Hospital experience.,"Eleven hepatic resections have been performed at William Beaumont Hospital between April 1979 and April 1983 for metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Eight lesions were metachronous, and three were synchronous. All lesions except three metachronous lesions were solitary nodules. Patients who were found to have metachronous lesions were initially evaluated because of rising carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. One postoperative death occurred (9% mortality). All patients with synchronous lesions have since died for a mean survival of 15.2 months. The mean survival for patients with metachronous lesions, excluding the postoperative mortality, was 15.4 months (range, 4.1-30.7 months). The 1-year and 2-year actuarial survival rates are 79 per cent and 33 per cent. Five patients are alive, and three are free of clinical disease; therefore survival is expected to improve. In conclusion, rising CEA levels can be used to detect patients with metachronous lesions. The actuarial data support resectional therapy for metastatic colorectal carcinoma of the liver in carefully selected patients."
CD011134,0,6736371,0,Computed tomography in recurrent or metastatic colon cancer: relation to rising serum carcinoembryonic antigen.,"Twenty patients with Stage Duke B or C adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum who have undergone radical surgical resection and demonstrated rising serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) during follow-up are the subject of this study. In all cases, while there was a continuous and progressive elevation of serum CEA, CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. Abnormal CT findings were demonstrated in 19 patients and included pelvic mass, liver metastases, and periaortic or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There was one normal CT scan in a patient who subsequently developed metastases in the sacrum. Based on the observations in these patients, it is concluded that in routine follow-up after colorectal surgery, rising serum CEA should be considered a warning sign and warrants additional investigation by CT."
CD011134,0,6733018,1,Serum CEA testing in the post-operative surveillance of colorectal carcinoma.,"Six hundred and sixty-three patients were followed with serial serum CEA measurements in addition to routine clinical surveillance after radical resection of colorectal carcinoma. Of 626 available for analysis, 366 (58.4%) remained clinically free of recurrence and had a normal CEA (less than 20 ng ml-1) throughout and 89 (14.2%) had a temporary non-progressive rise in CEA with no evidence of secondary disease. Of 171 patients who developed proven or suggestive recurrence, 114 had a preceding rise in the serum CEA and in further 21 the CEA rose simultaneously with recurrence. In 36 patients secondary disease was detected while the CEA was still within normal limits. CEA was more effective as an early index of distant metastasis, thus in 76% of those patients with a preceding rise in CEA, the secondary disease was disseminated, whereas only 20% had localised recurrence. The pattern of rise in CEA was of no practical value in distinguishing localised from distant recurrence."

CD011134,0,6710317,0,Automatic preoperative classification of carcinoma of the colon and rectum.,"The Dukes' and TNM systems for staging carcinoma of the colon and rectum are still the best pathologic classifications, but they do not apply to all patients and do not distinguish between patients who will die and patients who will be cured by the same therapeutic procedure. A new approach to this problem should be to establish a biochemical automatic classification, complementary to the morphologic one, which allow us to classify every patient before and after the first and subsequent treatments. By using several nonspecific tumor markers, such as CEA, AAT, AF, AAG, GGT and transferrine, a discriminant analysis was executed among the groups of patients with LD, RD and DD. Our initial results with only 12.8 per cent of incorrect classifications, that is patients classified in a less advanced group, suggest that this system may be quite useful in order to select those patients with carcinoma of the rectum who should benefit from preoperative radiotherapy as well as those who should receive adjuvant therapy after the first treatment. On the other hand, for patients classified in a more advanced group than the pathologic grading, we may well be able to identify those patients with occult disease for which the frequency of revisions should be shorter."
CD011134,0,6703792,0,Multivariate analysis of a personal series of 247 consecutive patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer. I. Treatment by hepatic resection.,"In the United States, there are an estimated 5000 to 6000 new patients annually who might be candidates for major hepatic resection to treat their recurrent colon cancer. Since 1971, the program reported here has evaluated various factors that might influence the curative potential of such an approach. Sixty-five patients had a major hepatic resection from March 1971 through May 1982. Using a stepwise proportional hazard analysis, all data that had been stored in CLINFO (a data analysis system by Bolt, Beranek and Newman; Boston, MA) were evaluated for the effect of multiple variables on the survival of patients with resected hepatic metastases. Twenty-seven had a right hepatic lobectomy; 14 had extended right hepatectomy with one having the caudate lobe also removed; ten had left lobectomy, nine had left lateral segmentectomy; and five had a major hepatic resection with three-dimensional wedge excision of a metastatic deposit in the contralateral lobe. The 30-day operative mortality rate was 7% (4/58) for patients undergoing the standard major hepatic resection. It was 14% for seven patients in whom the isolation-hypothermic perfusion technique was used early in the series. In ten patients, wedge excision only was required to remove the tumor. Stage I disease is defined as tumor confined to the resected portion of the liver without invasion of major intrahepatic vessels or bile ducts. Stage II disease is regional spread and Stage III disease is metastasis to lymph nodes or extraregional sites. The 3-year survival estimate was 66% for the 37 patients with Stage I disease. The 3-year survival estimate for 13 patients with Stage II disease was 58%. Five of the nine patients with Stage III disease are presently alive from 3 to 23 months; one of the other four died at 35 months of disease. The stage of liver disease was the most significant variable in this survival analysis (p = 0.02); Dukes' classification of colorectal primary was significant at p less than 0.05. Those factors found not to be significant determinants of survival were: number of metastatic hepatic deposits, site of colon primary, age, sex, preoperative liver function tests, and CEA."
CD011134,0,6699670,0,Criteria for monitoring carcinoembryonic antigen: variability of sequential assays at elevated levels.,"Fifty-five patients with advanced cancer and elevated plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels greater than 20 ng/mL (Roche assay) were monitored by clinical parameters for disease activity and a daily plasma specimen was obtained and stored frozen. In 45 patients with evaluable metastatic lesions, 35 were stable; five had progressive disease; and five had regressive disease. Plasma CEA in patients with stable disease showed an overall coefficient of variation of 13%. The CV did not differ according to various quantitative CEA levels from less than 100 ng/mL to greater than 1,000 ng/mL. The coefficient of variation in responding and progressive disease patients ranged from 13% to 63%. An analysis of CEA variability relative to the baseline CEA level was possible using the formula square root 2 times the variability about the mean; this yields a value of +/- 36% representing the range within which approximately 95% of sequential CEA levels would lie in the absence of a clinical change in disease. In 225 CEA determinations in stable disease patients, 6% demonstrated an increase beyond this level (36%) and none demonstrated a decrease of 36% or more from the baseline level. This study establishes guidelines for the boundaries of change in plasma CEA that may be applied as a criterion (in conjunction with standard objective disease parameters) for determination of tumor response to therapy."

The present study was designed to assess the usefulness of serum CEA assay on the diagnosis of colorectal cancer at various stages and in the care of prognosis. CEA was examined before and after surgery at appropriate intervals. Serum CEA test was positive (over 2.5 ng/ml) in 10.5% of the 19 patients with Dukes stage A, in 61.9% of 21 patients with Dukes stage B, and in 78.3% of 23 patients with Dukes stage C. Curative resection was able to perform in all of colorectal cancer patients with values of less than 2.5 ng/ml, in 75% of them with values of 2.5-10 ng/ml and in 45% of them with values of greater than 10 ng/ml. High serum CEA levels decreased to normal levels within 1-3 months after curative resection. High CEA levels were observed before the secondary operation in 4 out of 5 patients who underwent reoperation because of the evidence of recurrence. CEA decreased to normal levels in 3 of them and increased to 500 ng/ml in 1 case. In the last case CEA sustained high levels until the death due to metastasis to the lung and lymph nodes."
CD011134,0,6692277,0,Follow-up of breast cancer patients.,"Follow-up of patients with breast cancer is often pursued in an irregular, haphazard, and costly way. For patients who have had potentially curative treatment for localized breast cancer, effort should be concentrated for the life time of the patient on early detection of persistent or new breast cancers, and early detection of endometrial and large bowel cancers in order to maximize the chance of cure. The patient-physician interaction is the dominant factor in such follow-up. Bone and other scans and carcinoembryonic antigen levels do not detect curable disease, so these are not indicated for routine follow-up of patients with early stage disease. For patients with metastasis, follow-up has a different emphasis and is geared to defining the extent and activity of metastasis and early detection of treatable complications so as to optimize palliation. For all patients it is necessary to continually evaluate their social and emotional requirements and to evaluate the family for risk of cancer and other problems. A follow-up team, led by the physician, is required to best fulfill these multiple needs."
CD011134,0,6691692,0,Serum CEA in the follow-up of colorectal carcinoma: experience in a district general hospital.,"Serum CEA was measured at 6-monthly intervals, over a 3-year period, in 102 patients being followed up after apparently complete excision of colorectal carcinoma. Residual disease was identified in 27 patients and was preceded by a CEA rise in 22 of these patients (81.5%). The CEA was initially normal in 68% of patients with residual disease in whom it subsequently rose. Rise in CEA was not detected until a median of 14 weeks before recurrence was diagnosed clinically. CEA-instigated second-look laparotomy was performed in 7 patients (31.5% of cases with CEA-associated residual disease). Despite a high resectability rate, no patient was cured. The results might have been improved by more frequent CEA measurement and more immediate second-look laparotomy, but in this study, CEA rise was not associated with surgically curable residual disease."

The overall picture.,"The Large Bowel Cancer Project is a collaborative prospective study of 4228 patients with a histologically proven adenocarcinoma, of whom 2336 (55 per cent) survived a 'curative' resection. Follow-up information is available on 2220 patients (95 per cent). Subsequently, 309 (14 per cent) have developed a local recurrence confirmed by: biopsy (127; 41 per cent), clinical examination (77; 25 per cent), X-ray (15; 5 per cent), a raised CEA (2; 1 per cent), or some other method - e.g. CT scan or a confident unbiopsied laparotomy finding (88; 29 per cent). Statistically significant factors (chi2 test, P less than 0.05) associated with local recurrence are: Dukes' classification: A 4 per cent; B 13 per cent; C 18 per cent Tumour differentiation: Well 11 per cent; Moderate 14 per cent; Poor 21 per cent Obstruction: Absent 13 per cent; Present 21 per cent Perforation: Absent 13 per cent; Present 28 per cent Tumour mobility: Freely mobile 11 per cent; Others 21 per cent Operation performed (rectal and rectosigmoid tumours): Abdomino-perineal 12 per cent; Anterior resection 18 per cent; Surgeon (Consultant only): Range less than 5 per cent to greater than 20 per cent. Stratification of the above variables altered only the statistical significance pertaining to tumour differentiation (P less than 0.1, d.f. = 2). In particular, the differences between Consultant surgeons remained."

Plasma sialyltransferase and CEA level correlated well in 10 colon, 4 breast and 1 lung cancer patients in response to therapy. There was a negative correlation in one colon cancer, 3 breast cancer and 2 lung cancer patients. Plasma sialyltransferase was a better marker for breast and lung cancer.

CD011134,0,6591858,0,[Diagnosis of cancer using lymphocyte electrophoresis (2)].,"The surface charge of lymphocytes in cancer patients was analyzed in follow-up periods using an automated cell electrophoretic instrument (Parmoquant), and the changes in electrophoretic mobility pattern were compared with the results of the general clinical tests. The ratio of slow cells(mobility less than 0.95 micron/sec/V/cm) to fast cells(mobility greater than or equal to 0.95) (S/F ratio) was increased according to clinical stage, and wbs correlated with the levels of CEA, LDH, AI-P, alpha 2-globulin, total protein content and the number of peripheral lymphocytes. As a result of a follow-up study conducted for more than 2 years, the S/F ratio expressed the general condition of the patients and had better correlation with performance status than CEA, LDH, AI-P etc. The pattern analysis of lymphocyte electrophoresis may be useful for evaluation of patients' status, judgement of medical treatment and early detection of recurrence, because this method is very easy to assay and highly reproducible."

In cancer patients, the CA 19-9 level ranged from normal (0-37 U ml-1) to 77,500 U ml-1 whereas all samples but one from patients with benign colorectal diseases had a normal value. CA 19-9 was increased in 46% and 45% of patients with an advanced (Dukes C or D) carcinoma or a verified recidive, respectively. Only one out of 26 patients (4%) with a localized (Dukes A or B) carcinoma displayed an elevated CA 19-9 level (greater than 37 U ml-1). No clear correlation was found between the CA 19-9 and CEA levels. The sensitivity of the CA 19-9 test (36%) was poorer than that of the CEA assay (69%), but the new test was markedly more specific (97% vs 70%) than the CEA assay."

From the results and the statistical data, they concluded that it was useful to associate the two markers only in negative CEA test when confronted with clinical suspected metastatic diffusion."
CD011134,0,6529177,0,[Value of radioimmunological serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen in the postoperative monitoring of rectocolonic cancer].,"Fifty four patients, operated for colorectal cancer have been followed up for 2 to 100 months after surgery by carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) determinations and classical, clinical, biological, radiological, echographical, isotopical and tomoscanninvestigations. Each new serum sample has been assayed for CEA with previously collected samples within the same patients. This repetition of CEA on the same samples allows to check the good reproducibility of CEA radioimmunoassay (variation coefficient between assay is less than 10%) and to get a complete profile of CEA level evaluation within the same assay. There is a good correlation between clinical evolution and CEA levels. In 42 patients, CEA levels remained or became normal (less than 10 ng ml) after surgical resection of the tumors and no metastasis or local recurrence were detected. In 12 cases, CEA levels remained or became abnormally high (greater than 20 ng ml) at the same time or before clinical and/or paraclinical evidences for metastases or local recurrence. These results showed CEA assay in a quantitative parameter to assess the follow-up of colorectal cancer complementary to clinical, biological, radiological, echographical and isotopical criterias."
CD011134,0,6529171,0,[Systematic monitoring of the postoperative rectum].,"This study concerns the detection and treatment of recurrence after operation for colo-rectal cancer. The recurrences were classified as being in the suture line, peri-colonic, pelvic or distant metastasis. The factors which determine the appearance of recurrence depend on the tumour (development of the tumour and degree of anaplasia), the surgical technique (removal of the metastatic pathway and techniques intended to prevent the implantation of migrating tumour cells) and the patient (age, immunological factors, etc.). Our survey for the detection of recurrence consists of history and clinical examination of the patient, colonoscopy, carcino-embryonic antigen, routine laboratory tests, liver scan and/or ultrasonography, chest X-ray computerised tomography and, in a few special cases, lymphography; arteriography, etc. This group of investigations constitutes a surveillance protocol which should be performed regularly. We present the results of 443 follow-up surveys in 100 patients operated for colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,6513031,0,[Total pelvic exenteration for primary and locally recurrent rectal cancer].,Thirteen patients with advanced carcinoma of the lower colon and no evidence of extrapelvic metastasis were submitted to total pelvic exenteration with urinary diversion. The operative mortality rate was 7.7%. Determinate 5-year survival rate of 40% was achieved. Local recurrence of rectal cancer following abdominoperineal resection is rarely amenable to limited resection. Six patients with deeply invading recurrent lesions had pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection. This procedure seems a reasonable treatment for palliation and the chance of cure in selected patients. CT examination of the pelvis is very valuable for the early detection and localization of recurrence.
CD011134,0,6509799,0,"Circulating immune complexes (CIC), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CIC containing CEA as markers for colorectal cancer.",It has been suggested that circulating immune complexes (CIC) would provide a useful tumour marker system and that carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) may form an antigen component of CIC found in patients with colorectal cancer. In this study the clinical usefulness of CIC and CIC containing CEA (CEA-IC) was investigated. Concentrations of CIC were measured in 30 patients with colorectal cancer. Fourteen patients were studied sequentially at approximately 1 month intervals after apparent curative resection of the primary tumour. Results were correlated with those obtained from serum CEA and compared to clinical status. CEA-IC were measured using a novel assay and compared with CIC and CEA values in 29 patients. CIC concentrations were elevated in patients with known disease and predicted clinical relapse in four of 14 patients. In two patients CIC remained elevated despite sustained remission. CEA-IC were not detectable in any of the patients studied. CIC estimations may augment CEA measurements as indicators of disease recurrence but lack of specificity makes them of little practical value as tumour markers in colorectal cancer. No evidence was found to support previous reports that CEA was an antigen component of CIC in this disease.
CD011134,0,6507742,1,Follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer.,"In our follow-up study of 65 patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer, tests other than history and physical examination detected only two cases of potentially curable recurrent colorectal cancer. As a routine follow-up test, carcinoembryonic antigen determination is preferable to computerized tomographic scanning, since the sensitivity and specificity of carcinoembryonic antigen and computerized tomographic scanning were found to be equivalent and carcinoembryonic antigen is much less expensive. There was no benefit to the routine use of liver function tests or chest roentgenograms during follow-up. Since barium enema contributed little to what colonoscopy accomplished with greater comfort to the patient, barium enemas should be used only when colonoscopy is not totally successful in reaching the cecum. The most beneficial aspect of the follow-up of these patients is probably the elimination of future metachronous lesions by removal of small, benign polyps."

Values were obtained 1-36 months after surgery in all operable cases. Means were also evaluated statistically at various follow-up times. In patients who relapsed, values stayed significantly higher for up to 6 months after surgery than in those who did not. Cockran's method showed that the prognostic significance of this difference 6 months after surgery was p less than 0.05."
CD011134,0,6499621,0,Prospective studies of laboratory and radiologic tests in the management of colon and rectal cancer patients: I. Selection of useful preoperative tests through an analysis of surgically occult metastases.,"The laboratory and radiologic tests that give useful information in colon and rectal cancer patients over and above that obtained by routine work-up and surgical exploration of the abdomen have not been defined previously. An analysis of surgically occult metastases was used to discover which test would assist in the management of these patients. Occult metastases for radiologic tests were those occurring within one year after resection of the primary tumor; for CEA they were metastases occurring at any time following surgery. Full lung tomography, liver/spleen scan, computerized tomogram of the abdomen, intravenous pyelogram, bone scan, and postoperative baseline CEA greater than 2.5 ng/ml were analyzed. The postoperative baseline CEA was the most sensitive test detecting occult metastases in 57 per cent (12 out of 21) of a high risk patient population. Both postoperative baseline CEA and computerized tomograms of the abdomen had high positive predictive values of 71 and 67 per cent. The negative predictive percentage of computerized tomograms of the abdomen (18 per cent) was lower than that of CEA (21 per cent). In comparing these tests in individual patients with occult recurrence, postoperative CEA and computerized tomograms of the abdomen were seen to be complementary in that approximately 90 per cent of occult metastases were detected when both examinations were used. Computerized tomogram of the abdomen and postoperative baseline CEA are useful in patients with primary colorectal cancer as part of their routine work-up."

Measurements of ganglioside antigen level proved to be an efficient test for differentiating between benign and malignant tumors of the pancreas. However, it cannot be used as an aid to carcinoembryonic antigen test for detection of stomach and rectal cancers or their recurrences and metastases into the liver."
CD011134,0,6484790,0,The use of computerized tomography scan in the staging and follow-up study of carcinoma of the rectum.,"We have reviewed the CT scans of 30 patients who were evaluated for either primary or recurrent carcinoma of the colon and rectum in the pelvis. The results of our experience have shown that pelvic CT scans can provide accurate information regarding the extramural extension of carcinoma of the rectosigmoid undetected by other means. CT scans can detect significant ureteral pathology as accurately as can IVP and have essentially replaced the IVP in the preoperative evaluation of carcinoma of the rectum. Inflammation of the perirectal musculature, either by the effect of the local tumor or secondary to preoperative radiation, can make it difficult to determine if these structures are invaded by tumor. Tumor involvement, however, can be proved using CT localization and percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy techniques. During radiation therapy and chemotherapy, CT scans may also assist in treatment planning and may be the most reliable way of observing the objective response of the recurrent tumor in the pelvis. Finally, in the patient in whom the recurrent tumor does not produce abnormally high levels of CEA, the CT scan may be the only method by which the early and treatable recurrence may be detected. It is, therefore, appropriate to recommend that pelvic CT scan be a routine test for every patient who has had abdominoperineal resection or low anterior resection for carcinoma of the rectum and rectosigmoid."
CD011134,0,6484244,0,[Value of computerized tomography in the early detection of pelvic recurrences in patients subjected to resection of rectal cancer].,Forty eight patients surgically treated for carcinoma of the rectum were by computed tomography (CT) during routine follow up to test the value if this procedure in the early diagnosis of pelvic recurrences. We used a protocol which schedules controls at different intervals for Dukes A e B and for Dukes C patients; CT showed pelvic recurrences in 13.3% of the Dukes A e B and in 50% of Dukes C cases. CT seems to be the most reliable presently available test in detecting early extraluminal recurrence after radical resection for rectal cancer.

CD011134,0,6418372,0,Cost effectiveness of postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring in colorectal cancer.,"Serial monitoring of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has been thought to provide early indication of recurrent cancer in individuals who have undergone curative resection. The current study was designed to assess the costs associated with CEA monitoring. Costs included CEA determinations, other evaluative tests prompted by abnormal CEA values and hospital/surgical costs in patients undergoing ""second-look"" procedures. The authors estimated that the cost per resectable tumor was $24,779; but, under optimal circumstances, it might be as low as $10,446. The most important factors were the percentage of recurrent tumors and the proportion of these that were resectable. It proved slightly more efficient to limit the preoperative workup rather than to decrease the frequency of CEA determinations. The true benefits of CEA initiated second-look surgery in terms of prolonged survival remain unknown. More clinical experience is needed to better understand these benefits."
CD011134,0,6394125,0,Clinical perspective of human colorectal cancer metastasis.,"Death from colorectal cancer frequently results from manifestations of recurrent local or metastatic disease following initial 'curative' therapy. Presently, the attempted curative treatment of recurrent colorectal cancer lays in the hands of the surgeon. This paper reviews the natural history of surgically treated large bowel cancer and summarizes published and National Cancer Institute experience with the surgical therapy of recurrent disease. A schema with rationale is offered for follow-up of the patient following 'curative' bowel resection. The treatment of recurrent disease incorporating the use of CEA initiated second-look laparotomy is advocated. Hepatic and pulmonary resections for metastatic disease are accepted as important therapeutic endeavours, and are discussed in some detail. It is concluded that of all patients diagnosed as having large bowel cancer, roughly 70% are resectable for cure at time of presentation, and 45% will indeed be cured by primary resection. Of the 25% who fail primary therapy, approximately 20% (5% of all colorectal cancer patients) can be cured by local re-resection or hepatic or pulmonary resection."

Twenty six patients in the treatment group received 5FU and methyl CCNU from the time of randomisation and the remaining 26 controls were given further therapy only if there were clinical indications. All patients were followed for five years or until their death and all but one (control) developed clinical evidence of recurrence. Overall there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to disease free interval and survival. Whereas the rise in CEA in controls was generally progressive, marked inflections on the CEA curves were seen in the majority of patients receiving early treatment. Eight of 26 treated patients showed a fall in CEA of greater than 20% two months after starting therapy. These patients had a median disease free interval of 90 weeks and a median survival of 107 weeks, these figures being longer than those of treated patients who did not show a fall in CEA and control patients. The serum CEA therefore appeared to give important prognostic information in patients receiving cytotoxic treatment. Early therapy was generally well tolerated."
CD011134,0,6375928,0,A study of the reliability of carcinoembryonic antigen blood levels in following the course of colorectal cancer.,"Twenty-three patients were studied to assess the reliability of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in following the course of colorectal cancer. CEA estimations were made prior to surgery and again postoperatively. The resected specimens were allocated a Dukes' Stage and histological grading (well, moderate or poorly differentiated). In addition, sections were stained for the presence of CEA by an immunoperoxidase method. Of the 23 patients, twelve had either disseminated disease at initial surgery or subsequently developed metastasis/recurrence. Eleven remain disease-free at a minimum follow-up of one year. In all of these the reliability of plasma CEA values in reflecting the disease status has been assessed. No false positive elevations of CEA were found. Three factors emerge as positive predictors of CEA estimation reliability: pre-operative CEA elevation; tumour grading as well differentiated; dark staining for the presence of CEA. These factors identified 15 of the 18 patients (83%) in whom CEA appeared reliable and were not present in any of the five patients where CEA was not reliable. This reliability achieves statistical significance (X2 = 8.5, p less than 0.02). Histological demonstration of CEA may contribute to the reliability placed on plasma CEA estimations and should be considered if serial estimations are to be performed."

Rabbit anti-CEA ( Dako , FRG) was adsorbed to polypropylene tubes. CEA-like molecules and IgG containing immune complexes bound to the solid phase. They were detected by binding peroxidase-labelled anti-IgG antibodies and quantified by measuring the optical density (OD) at 492 nm after oxidation of orthophenylene diamine. Sera of 68 controls had a mean OD 492 of 1.19 +/- 0.26 (means +/- SD). An extinction of more than 1.97 (means + 3 SD) was judged as elevated. Fourteen of 69 patients after surgical treatment of colorectal carcinoma showed elevated OD 492 up to a value of 3.92. In five patients with benign diseases of colon or rectum normal values were found. In 7 of 41 patients without recurrence or metastases CEA-IgG-IC were elevated although the CEA was normal, and in one case both parameters were elevated. In four of 22 patients with tumor progression CEA-IgG-IC and CEA were elevated, whereas in two cases only CEA-IgG-IC were found."
CD011134,0,6372985,0,Intramucosal carcinoma of the small intestine arising in regional enteritis (Crohn's disease). Report of a case studied for carcinoembryonic antigen and review of the literature.,"A case of carcinoma of the small intestine arising in a patient with regional enteritis (Crohn's disease) of the ileum is reported. The patient, a 54-year-old woman, had a 21-year history of regional enteritis which was treated intermittently with sulfasalazine and prednisone. Segmental resections of the ileum had been performed on two previous occasions. Because of recurrent low-grade intestinal obstruction, another segment of ileum was resected. The bowel demonstrated the typical gross and histologic appearance of regional enteritis. Histologic examination also disclosed a carcinoma that was confined to the ileal mucosa. This case is the first reported in which a small bowel carcinoma arising in regional enteritis has been found only in the mucosa. Adjacent to the carcinoma, the mucosa showed varying degrees of dysplasia consistent with the ""precancerous"" changes that have been described in inflammatory bowel disease. Using a peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunoperoxidase technique, carcinoembryonic antigen was identified in normal, hyperplastic, dysplastic, and carcinomatous mucosa, but the most intense staining was seen in hyperplastic and dysplastic cells. Carcinoembryonic staining, however, did not aid in differentiating between hyperplasia, dysplasia, and carcinoma because of an overlap in staining frequency and intensity."
CD011134,0,6370155,0,The prognostic significance of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels in colorectal cancer. Results from NSABP (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project) clinical trials.,"This analysis explores the prognostic significance of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in patients with colorectal cancer. The data were derived from 945 patients entered into two randomized prospective clinical trials of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project. A strong correlation was evident between preoperative CEA level and Dukes class. The mean CEA progressively increased with each Dukes category and the mean value for each of the four classes was significantly different. This relationship was prevalent whether the data were analyzed for all colorectal lesions regardless of location or specifically for right-sided colon tumors. The prognostic function of preoperative CEA level was independent of the number of positive histologic nodes. Preoperative CEA level correlated with the degree of lumen encirclement by tumor. Tumors that did not encircle more than one half the lumen were associated with significantly lower preoperative CEA levels than those that did. The presence or absence of lumen obstruction was unrelated to the preoperative CEA level. The relative risk of developing a treatment failure was associated with preoperative CEA, in both Dukes B and C patients, demonstrating that the prognostic significance of preoperative CEA was independent of Dukes class."
CD011134,0,6324604,0,Patterns of failure after surgical cure of large liver tumors. A change in the proximate cause of death and a need for effective systemic adjuvant therapy.,"During a period of 7 years, we have aggressively treated liver tumors whether primary or metastatic. Our experience after 43 curative major liver resections has shown an excellent overall survival: 34 of 43 patients still alive a median of 12 months after liver resection (patient ages ranged from 21 to 85 years, median 57 years). Nineteen patients underwent right hepatic lobectomy, 9 trisegmentectomy, 5 left hepatic lobectomy, 5 extended left hepatic lobectomy, 4 right lobectomy plus left lobe wedge resection, and 1 patient underwent a major hilar wedge resection. Two patients died from sepsis and hepatic failure on or before the 60th postoperative day. One patient with no evidence of recurrent colorectal cancer was lost to follow-up after 2.5 years. One patient died without cancer 12 months after left hepatic lobectomy for colon cancer metastases. Cumulative survival for the entire series and for patients after resection of colorectal cancer metastases was the same: 1 year survival 90 percent; 2 year survival 75 percent, and 3 year survival 65 percent. Seventeen of 30 patients remain disease-free after resection of liver metastases. Of the 13 who had recurrence, 8 are still alive. Ten recurrences were outside of the residual liver (predominantly multiple pulmonary metastases). One recurrence was in the right hemidiaphragm, and only three were in the residual or regenerated liver. Serial carcinoembryonic antigen analysis was the best indicator of recurrence in these 13 patients, 12 of whom were asymptomatic. These data confirm that major liver resection can be performed with minimum postoperative mortality (4.7 percent in this series). More importantly, the majority of patients were cured of their liver metastases. The next goal should be the initiation of adjuvant systemic therapy trials after liver resection in such patients."

In the early stages of gastric and colorectal carcinomas the sensitivity of the CA 19-9 test was between 10 and 25% and increased to about 50% in tumour stage IV. Detection rate in pancreatic carcinoma was 88% and thus markedly higher. The specificity of the test, as against the group of benign abdominal diseases, was 95%. Postoperative CA 19-9 follow-up showed unaltered individual baseline values in 192 out of 196 cases without clinical evidence of tumour progression. However, in 40 out of 61 cases (66%) with recurrencies or metastases continuous increases of CA 19-9 were observed which preceded the clinical relapse by up to 16 months (median 2 months). Concomitant determination of CEA increased sensitivity to 90% due to partial complementary information. This was particularly pronounced in gastric carcinomas in whom continuous increases of CEA involved only 58% of all patients with tumour progression. By simultaneous determination of both tumour markers this ratio rose by increases of both or one antigen to 83%."

We observed a linear relationship between log CEA and time over a period of up to 30 days after transplantation of the tumors. In all experiments tumor mass-volume correlated well with concomitant increase of the circulating CEA concentration. A marked dissociation became evident when tumor growth rate slowed down. At that time histologic investigations indicated that necrosis of the tumor could be a potential factor for this phenomenon. A retrospective analysis of the CEA time courses in 114 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer gave evidence for similar CEA developments in 87 cases also exhibiting linear log CEA development with time. Individual CEA doubling times calculated from linear log CEA increases correlated well with observed survival in 36 patients with untreated visceral metastasis. Moreover, the CEA doubling time represented an objective parameter to rate the effect of various postoperative therapies when survival is expressed in multiples of individual CEA doubling times."
CD011134,0,6858539,1,CEA radioimmunoassay. Clinical applications in colorectal cancer.,"Since 1978 carcino-embryonic antigen determinations (CEA) have been used systematically in the preoperative as well as in the postoperative assessment of 139 patients operated for colorectal cancers. From these data results that CEA determination is of poor value for screening purposes, as 30% of the tumors don't produce the specific CEA antigen. High preoperative levels which normalize after operation, are equal to curative resection. The importance of CEA is emphasized in the postoperative follow-up of especially Dukes B and C lesions, where starting from normal base figures, increasing CEA levels are suggesting recurrences, long before their clinical evidence. Serial CEA determinations may show a slow rise, and in these cases a second look procedure can be considered. Clinical examination stays primordial; CEA is a good marker, and on account of the low cost, allows to be inserted in the postoperative follow-up scheme."

In 36 patients, subsequent clinical evidence of a recurrence of the disease developed during the study period. Monitoring with APRP can detect a recurrence of the disease at the subclinical stage in the majority of patients and appears to be complimentary to monitoring with CEA. However, due to the low incidence of surgical removal of recurrent carcinoma, this does not give real benefit for patients."

CD011134,0,6839898,0,The strongest prognostic factors in colorectal carcinoma. Surgicopathologic stage of disease and postoperative fever.,"Of 227 patients with stage B or C colorectal carcinoma operated for ""cure,"" 132 had a febrile postoperative course. Of the latter, five patients (3.7 per cent) died of sepsis. The five-year actuarial recurrence rate for 227 patients was 53 per cent. When the patients were divided into groups according to stage of disease and postoperative fever, the following was found: Eighty-one low stage patients (B1 + B2) had a 34 per cent five-year actuarial recurrence rate, and 146 high-stage patients (B3 + C4 + C2)-- a 71 per cent rate (P less than 0.0005). Fever occurred postoperatively in 46 per cent of low-stage patients and in 65 per cent of high-stage patients (P = 0.004). In low-stage patients, the five-year actuarial recurrence rate was 3 per cent in the group with an afebrile postoperative course, and 66 per cent in that with fever (P much less than 0.0005). Similarly, in high-stage patients, the recurrence rate was 24 and 93 per cent, respectively in the group with afebrile and febrile postoperative courses (P much less than 0.0005). Preoperative plasma CEA levels seemed to have no bearing upon prognosis, unless above 20 ng/ml. Eighty-two per cent of patients who had serial postoperative plasma CEA measurements and recurrence of cancer had increasing CEA levels. Thus, postoperative fever lasting two or more days was the most unfavorable prognostic factor, highly significant statistically, whereas stage of disease ranked only second in isolating better prognoses among operated patients from those at higher risks of recurrence."
CD011134,0,6837892,0,Circulating immune complexes in patients with colorectal cancer.,"We have attempted to better define host humoral immune response in neoplasia by quantitating serial circulating immune complex values before and after surgery in patients with primary or metastatic colorectal cancer. Circulating immune complex levels were correlated with serial carcinoembryonic antigen values and tumor courses in patients with primary resectable colorectal cancer (four patients), resectable liver metastases (three patients), diffuse liver metastases treated with regional chemotherapy (three patients), and untreated intrahepatic (one patient) and extrahepatic metastases (one patient). Circulating immune complex levels, as measured by an antigen-nonspecific assay, which utilized 4 percent polyethylene glycol insolubilization, were increased in all patients at presentation (734 delta OD450 +/- 381) when compared with normal human control sera (202 +/- 4, p less than 0.05). No particular relation was found between presenting circulating immune complex levels and tumor burden. Progressive circulating immune complex increases were demonstrated only in patients whose tumors were either completely removed or dramatically responded to regional therapy (that is, when the tumor antigen load, as reflected by the carcinoembryonic antigen value, rapidly diminished). Serum samples obtained at times of presumed antibody excess in the patients with gastrointestinal cancers were found to contain unexpectedly high concentrations of IgA. We believe these data demonstrate the kinetics of circulating immune complex change during tumor course and they have allowed us to begin to identify circulating immune complex components in patients with colorectal cancer. The results confirm our earlier findings in patients with gestational tumors and differ from accepted relations between immune complexes and tumor growth."
CD011134,0,6830687,0,Decreased blood histamine levels in patients with solid malignant tumours.,"In a one-year follow-up study, 444 blood histamine determinations were performed in 163 patients with solid malignant tumours. Compared with normal subjects, blood histamine levels were significantly lower in patients with unresected primary tumours (30.7 +/- 19.9 ng ml-1), metastases (34.1 +/- 17.1 ng ml-1), or both (24.5 +/- 12.8 ng ml-1). By contrast, after successful tumour resection, histamine blood levels were nearly normal (52.1 +/- 18.4 ng ml-1, versus 59.6 +/- 22.6 in control patients). Stability of the histamine blood levels was associated with stability of the disease. A progressive decrease in histamine blood levels preceded clinical relapse or detection of metastasis. In patients with consecutive histamine blood levels which were less than 15 ng ml-1, survival did not exceed 2 months. In patients with gastrointestinal tumours, blood histamine levels provided information additional to that derived from serum CEA determination. In patients with non-gastrointestinal tumours, the blood histamine level may be of more value than CEA as a marker of disease progression."

Cancer cells were found histologically in the portal vein in these cases. Serum CEA levels were abnormally high in the cases of vein invasion in 57%. Hematogenic metastases occurred in 90% in the cases of vein invasion with abnormal CEA level.

Computed tomographic (CT) study of the pelvis revealed recurrent tumor images in relation to the adjacent pelvic structures. Five patients with deeply invading recurrent lesions were submitted to pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection. No postoperative deaths were encountered. The postoperative sharp drops of serum CEA levels are useful for judging the adequacy of this procedure. The follow-up status of the 5 patients, respectively: 14 months alive with pulmonary metastasis, 9 months alive without symptoms but with slightly elevated CEA levels, and 8 months, 3 months, and 3 weeks alive with no evidence of disease. All patients who were relieved of perineal or sciatic nerve pain are now able to walk without any assistance or trouble. Total en bloc residual pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection is a reasonable treatment for locally recurrent rectal cancer."

During this period, we observed recurrent neoplastic disease in 14 patients. A retrospective analysis of the results showed that: 1. patients with a preoperative CEA value greater than 20 ng/ml have a significantly higher risk of recurrence than the patients with CEA less than 20 ng/ml; 2. sensitivity of the CEA test was good for metastatic recurrent disease, fairly good for residual neoplastic disease, but insufficient for local recurrence; 3. test-specificity was poor, as demonstrated by the negative results of four exploratory laparotomies performed exclusively on the basis of increased CEA levels. Since the principal aim of a second-look operation is the cure of local recurrence, this type of surgery cannot be proposed only on the basis of increased CEA levels."
CD011134,0,6613142,0,[Value of computer tomography of the small pelvis for the early diagnosis of local recurrence after surgery of rectal cancer].,"The value of pelvic computed tomography (CT) in the detection of local recurrence following radical operation for rectal cancer was assessed in a prospective study on 15 patients. A positive CT finding was checked in every instance by a second-look operation (11 cases). Tumour tissue in the pelvis was found in 9 patients, whereas in 2 patients the positive CT finding was proven to be false. 5 out of 9 cases with recurrent tumour underwent radical surgery. In the 4 cases with a negative CT finding no recurrence has developed after a median observation time of 34 months. Pelvic CT is a useful and reliable method of detecting pelvic recurrence before it becomes clinically obvious. However, the method does not allow certain prediction of whether or not the recurrence will be radically operable."
CD011134,0,6605069,0,The pelvis after surgery for rectal carcinoma: serial CT observations with emphasis on nonneoplastic features.,"Ten asymptomatic patients who had undergone resection of rectal carcinoma were evaluated prospectively by at least three serial computed tomographic (CT) examinations of the pelvis within 24 months of surgery. Of the seven patients who had undergone abdominoperineal resection, five were found to have a presacral mass due to normal postoperative changes within the first 4 months. The mass showed a variable diminution between 4 and 9 months after operation and developed a more distinct outline, partial separation from the sacrum, or a change in configuration to a thin transverse sliver. These changes indicate the possibility of CT differentiation of a normal postoperative mass from local recurrence. In the other five patients, no postoperative mass was observed. In one patient CT demonstrated a solitary 1.5 cm lymph node metastasis. This patient was asymptomatic and had a normal carcinoembryonic antigen level. From these observations, a baseline CT study of the pelvis within 2-4 months of resection of rectal carcinoma, followed by serial CT examinations at about 6-month intervals is recommended for the detection of early asymptomatic pelvic recurrence and to facilitate differentiation from persistent postoperative changes."
CD011134,0,6572745,0,Postsurgical follow-up of colorectal cancer patients monitored by the leukocyte migration test.,"Blood samples from more than 1,000 patients with colorectal cancer were tested in the leukocyte migration test (LMT) and by a radioimmunoassay for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) for evaluation of: 1) the correlation of LMT response to the status of disease and 2) the use of LMT and CEA determination in the monitoring of patients after surgical removal of the primary tumor. A total of 320 patients, which were tested repeatedly, constituted the key group of the investigation: Of these, 56 patients developed recurrences or metastases whereas 217 patients showed no sign of reactivated disease. The group of patients with persistent absence of disease showed test profiles of either persistent negativity (50%) or conversion of one or both parameters; persistently positive profiles were rarely encountered. Patients with recurrences and metastases showed either positive profiles or conversion of positivity; only 3 patients were negative in both tests. However, despite significant disease-related response of the LMT, the test is not recommended as an adjunct to postsurgical monitoring, because of its technical complexity."
CD011134,0,6418238,0,[Cancer of the rectum: preoperative radiotherapy (344 cases)].,"Radiation therapy prescribed as an adjuvant to surgery is an effective treatment of many cancers but has not been universally accepted for treatment of rectal cancer. Since 1969, preoperative radiation therapy of rectal carcinoma has been proposed in a curative intent, both at Centre Paul Lamarque in Montpellier and at Centre Claudius Regaud in Toulouse, France. Megavoltage radiotherapy was used in all patients and doses ranges from 35 to 40 Gy during 2.5 to 3 weeks. Among the 344 patients treated between 1969 and 1981, the ratio of abdominoperineal excision to anterior resection was 239/105, the percentage of pelvic recurrence was 7,8 per cent, and the 5-year survival rate, including postoperative mortality (5.2%) was 78 per cent in the Centre Claudius Regaud series and 64 per cent in the Centre Paul Lamarque series. The 10-year survival rate was 50 per cent. There was no evidence of an increased morbidity following irradiation. Pathologic staging showed no residual tumour in the excised specimen in 5.2 per cent of the cases. The number of Dukes'C cases was smaller than according to the clinical pre-treatment assessment of the tumours (16%). Ultrasonography of the liver and plasmatic CEA determination avoid irradiation of metastatic patients. Further development of this curative approach should include a postoperative boost of 25 Gy for patients who are at high risk for local failure in the pelvis, and an adjuvant chemotherapy for Dukes'C patients."

CD011134,0,6404406,1,Role of carcinoembryonic antigen in detection of asymptomatic disseminated disease in colorectal carcinoma.,"Fifty one patients were studied prospectively to evaluate the role of sequential determinations of the carcino-embryonic antigen concentration in the detection of asymptomatic disseminated disease after curative resection for colorectal carcinoma. Computed tomography of the liver was performed during the immediate postoperative period in all patients. Serum concentrations of the antigen were estimated at three month intervals for a minimum of two years. Computed tomography at the time of operation detected occult hepatic metastases in 12 patients. Of the remaining 39 patients, six developed local recurrence alone, two developed disseminated disease in the absence of hepatic metastases, and one developed hepatic disease at 10 months, as detected by sequential computed tomography. Of all 13 patients with asymptomatic hepatic metastases, only eight developed an increase in serum carcinoembryonic antigen concentrations before death. The median interval between detection by computed tomography and rise in antigen concentrations was 7.5 months. The corresponding median interval from increase in concentration to death was only 5.5 months. Of the six patients who developed local recurrence alone, only two had raised concentrations of the antigen. These results suggest that increase in the serum carcinoembryonic antigen concentration occurs late in colorectal carcinoma."

In this paper a method for determination of this antigen for tissue sections is given. Histology, immunohistology and serum levels of CEA were compared. Tissue sections were obtained by surgical and endoscopic techniques. In several cases there was a discrepancy between serological and morphological results. Based on recent investigations elevated CEA levels might be only useful in reflecting a relapse of carcinoma of the colon. Immunohistological determinations were done by IFT and PAP-method. The results of both assay systems were comparable. CEA could be also detected in benign neoplasiogenic tissue, i.e. in tubular type of adenomatose polyps and in ulcerative colitis. Both diseases are known to become malignant at an high degree. By contrast no CEA could be detected in hyperplasiogenic polyps. Detection of CEA in malignant tissue might be useful for final classification of tumors. Occurrence of CEA in non malignant tissue should give rise to control in short regular intervals. Prospective studies might show the reliability of the CEA-bearing cells of non malignant tissue."

Comparison with carcinoembryonic antigen].,"This work presents an evaluation of the diagnostic value of seric beta 2-microglobulin in the follow-up of operated colorectal cancers. Ninety-one patients were operated on with a curative intent between 1976 and 1979. These patients were followed for at least 2 years and divided in 2 groups: a) group NR: 48 patients apparently free of loco-regional recurrence and of distant metastases, b) group R: 43 patients presenting a cancerous relapse. High levels of beta 2-microglobulin were found in 21 patients of group NR (specificity: 56 p. 100) and in 25 patients of group R (sensitivity: 58 p. 100). In the same population, the specificity and the sensitivity of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) for the diagnosis of a relapse were 92 p. 100 and 88 p. 100 respectively. No significant statistical correlation was observed between the levels of beta 2-microglobulin and CEA. The sensitivity of the association beta 2-microglobulin + CEA was not superior to the dosage of CEA alone despite its reduced specificity (54 p. 100). These results indicate that the diagnostic value of the dosage of beta 2-microglobulin is inferior to that of CEA and is without interest for the detection of tumoral recurrence in the postoperative follow-up of colorectal cancers."

In the postoperative screening of radical cystectomized patients with intestinal urinary diversion high CEA levels gave primarily suspicion for tumor recurrence or metastases, however met-screenings were negative. In a prospective study 54 cystectomized bladder cancer patients with colonic conduit or ureterosigmoidoistomy were compared with cystectomized non-tumor-patients concerning the CEA levels in plasma and urine. Raised CEA-levels were obtained in more than 80% of the non-tumor-patients; urinary CEA was positive in 90% (m = greater than 2000 ng/ml), whereas only 3/5 patients with demonstrable tumor recurrence revealed raised CEA levels. The study shows significantly that determination of CEA in the postoperative screening care of bladder cancer patients with intestinal urinary diversion is not a useful tool in the armamentarium of tumor-screening."

We examined a commercial RIA kit using heat inactivation, and compared results with those obtained with PCA precipitation. Adequate sensitivity (1.5 micrograms CEA/l plasma), satisfactory analytical recovery of CEA added to plasma, and dilutional linearity of samples found to have elevated CEA concentrations, were demonstrated for the heat-inactivation assay. Between-assay precision was better with the heat inactivation than with the PCA assay. Although the absolute concentration of CEA estimated after heat inactivation was consistently lower than that estimated after PCA extraction of plasma specimens, there was excellent correlation between results obtained with the two methods in colon cancer patients free of disease, colon cancer patients with residual or recurrent disease, patients with benign gastrointestinal disease, and in patients with chronic renal failure. We conclude that the heat-inactivation assay is an excellent alternative to the PCA assay."
CD011134,0,6295871,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen radioimmunodetection in the evaluation of colorectal cancer and in the detection of occult neoplasms.,"Radioimmunodetection of colorectal cancer was evaluated in 51 patients by injecting 131I-labeled goat antibody immunoglobulin G against carcinoembryonic antigen and performing total-body photoscans with a gamma scintillation camera 24 and 48 h later. The scintigrams were then processed by computer to subtract the images of the 99mTc-serum albumin and pertechnetate administered, which reflect background and nontarget radioactivity, from the 131I-antibody scans. The results indicate that radioimmunodetection is a safe and a potentially clinically useful cancer detection method, which in this study demonstrated primary colorectal carcinomas in 10 of 12 (83%) of the patients evaluated preoperatively and between 87% (46 of 53) and 92% (49 of 53) of known metastatic tumor sites. Thus, the method's overall sensitivity (true-positive rate) was 86%-91% on a tumor-site basis. A false-negative rate of between 9% and 14% and a false-positive rate of less than 4% were found. In 11 of the 51 patients evaluated, tumor sites were detected that were not found by other clinical methods of cancer detection. These sites of tumor were then confirmed later, as much as 40 wk after radioimmunodetection was performed. It is concluded that in colorectal cancer patients, the current method of carcinoembryonic antigen radioimmunodetection can (a) contribute to the preoperative clinical staging of the patients, (b) assist in the postoperative evaluation of tumor recurrence or spread, (c) complement other methods used to assess tumor response to therapy, (d) support the indication of a rising carcinoembryonic antigen titer (when other methods cannot detect tumor) for second-look surgery, and (e) confirm the findings of other detection measures that are less tumor-specific."
CD011134,0,6194734,0,Overview of oncofetal antigens in cancer.,Oncofetal antigens are substances which are produced by tumors and also by fetal tissues but they are produced in much lower concentration by adult tissues. The oncofetal antigens which have been identified are reviewed. The relevance of alpha - 1 - fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in neoplastic disease are summarized. Elevated serum concentrations of AFP have been principally associated with primary liver cell cancer (82 percent) and with ovarian and testicular tumors which contain yolk sac tumor cell elements. Quantitation of the serum concentration of CEA can be used as an adjunct for the diagnosis and staging of colon cancer patients and for the post operative follow up of patients for tumor recurrence. The possible role that mouse monoclonal antibodies will play in the characterization of oncofetal antigens is reviewed. Some of the difficulties which may arise when mouse monoclonal antibodies are used to define clinically relevant oncofetal antigens are reviewed.
CD011134,0,6192917,0,Plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as an indicator for radical or palliative radiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer.,"A study of 59 patients referred for radiotherapy because of inoperable or recurrent rectal cancers is presented in which a correlation is made between the response to radiotherapy and the pretreatment serum CEA level. Patients were treated radically or palliatively on the basis of clinical presentation and routine laboratory tests, but without regard to the plasma CEA level prior to treatment. The pretreatment CEA level was assessed retrospectively as an indicator of the response to treatment. Patients with a plasma CEA level in excess of 75 ng/ml had a poor prognosis, even after radical radiotherapy, whereas patients with plasma CEA less than 75 ng/ml responded better to treatment. These results suggest that plasma CEA is of value, indicating the need for radical or palliative radiotherapy. In patients with high plasma CEA at referral, radical radiotherapy appears to confer little benefit. Those with a low plasma CEA appear to respond better to radical radiotherapy, and this should be the preferred treatment in this group unless the clinical presentation indicates otherwise."
CD011134,0,6189579,0,Acute-phase reactant proteins and carcinoembryonic antigen in cancer of the colon and rectum.,"One hundred and twenty-eight patients bearing primary malignancies of the large bowel were studied to ascertain the value of acute-phase reactant proteins (serum protein hexose, ceruloplasmin, transferrin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, seromucoid and haptoglobin) either alone or in conjunction with carcinoembryonic antigen to accurately reflect the disease status of patients both before and after resection of their large bowel malignancy. The results indicate that acute-phase reactant proteins have a higher diagnostic rate for the presence of malignancy than does CEA. Estimation of the serum protein hexose alone is of greater diagnostic value than a combination of acute-phase reactant proteins. Furthermore, serum protein hexose and CEA are complementary and when combined will reflect the presence of malignancy in a greater number of patients than either one alone. Following resection of primary large bowel cancer, acute-phase reactant proteins are as accurate as CEA in evaluating the disease-free status of patients and furthermore when combined with CEA increased the predictive value for the detection of patients with recurrent disease."
CD011134,0,6133709,1,Is CEA analysis of value in screening for recurrences after surgery for colorectal carcinoma?,"The progress of 139 patients operated upon for cure of colorectal carcinoma, was followed postoperatively with a standardized protocol. A CEA test was performed for comparison with other parameters. Median observation time was four years. When an upper limit for CEA of 7.5 micrograms/1 was allowed, sensitivity was found to be 78 per cent, specificity 91 per cent, and predictive value of an elevated CEA concentration, 83 per cent. In general, CEA measurement traced recurrence six months before clinical diagnosis. In only a few cases was recurrence first heralded by an abnormality in other blood chemistry test results. CEA may thus be used in postoperative screening for recurrence even though most recurrences, when detected, are not curable."
CD011134,0,7171456,0,Doubling time of circulating cea and its relation to survival of patients with recurrent colorectal cancer.,"In a retrospective study the postoperative time courses of CEA in colorectal cancer patients with recurrent disease were analysed. In 87/114 cases with increasing concentrations of circulating CEA under close follow-up a linear relationship between log CEA and time could be established during disease recurrence. The individual doubling times of the serum CEA concentration in the log CEA period were calculated and found to cover distinct ranges dependent on the diagnosis of disease recurrence. The CEA doubling times concomitant with local recurrence or second primary carcinomas ranged from 142 to 868 days, visceral metastasis other than liver metastasis from 47 to 231 days and liver metastasis from 10 to 102 days. Patients with bone metastases exhibited CEA doubling times of 54-60 days and a patient with brain metastasis had a CEA doubling time of 598 days. The CEA doubling times of patients with liver metastasis and no further treatment, correlated well with the time of survival after the initial CEA increase of the log CEA phase (r = 0.870, n = 33). The mean survival expressed in multiples of the individual CEA doubling times was 7.0 +/- 1.8. Patients with liver metastasis who underwent various treatments of recurrent disease had a distinctly longer mean survival of 17.4 +/- 9.4 CEA doubling times (P less than 0.001). CEA doubling times can be used as a potential method to assess the efficacy of various treatments."
CD011134,0,7148317,1,Clinical significance of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in patients with adenocarcinoma in colon and rectum.,"Determination of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in serum has been performed in 253 patients with proved adenocarcinoma in the colon and rectum. Preoperative CEA was normal in 58.3% of the patients. A correlation between CEA level and Dukes' grading was found. There was, however, no statistically significant difference in recurrence rate between patients with normal and patients with elevated pre-operative CEA. Transient CEA elevation was seen in the follow-up period after curative resection in 21.8%. 75% of the patients with recurrence had abnormal CEA, and CEA elevation was the first sign of recurrence in 59.1%. The majority of these patients, however, had advanced disease not available for surgical treatment. In cases with local resectable tumour CEA often was normal. Only a few patients had advantage of CEA determination for diagnosis of recurrence and its routine use is therefore questioned."
CD011134,0,7139558,0,Colon cancer: special surgical considerations.,"Three factors dictate the long-term clinical outcome of colon and rectal cancer surgery: (1) the biological characteristics of the malignancy; (2) the stage of the tumor; and (3) a combination of meticulous pre- and postoperative care with a skillfully performed surgical procedure which accomplished the complete removal of the primary malignancy and its regional lymphatic, as well as transmitted and vascular spread when feasible. The postoperative follow-up should include a comparison of the preoperation CEA value with monthly CEA determinations done every month for the first two years and every three months for the next three years. Two of three recurrences occur in the first two years and nine of ten recurrences occur before five years. After five years, and annual colonoscopy or barium enema plus CEA and careful physical examination will help detect the second primary which will occur more often in these patients than in a normal population."
CD011134,0,7139557,0,The role of tumor markers in the management of colorectal cancer.,"Among the tumor-associated antigens evaluated for the diagnosis and management of cancer, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the only established and clinically useful tumor marker for colorectal cancer and other CEA-producing tumors. Because of the exhaustive studies in the past decade, a consensus development conference was held at NIH in September 1980, to address the issue concerning the role of CEA as a marker in the management of cancer. This conference concluded that the use of regular and sequential assays of blood CEA is the best noninvasive technique for postoperative surveillance of patients to detect disseminated recurrence of colorectal cancer. The CEA level can serve as an indicator of successful or incomplete resection, and is useful in monitoring the effect of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. CEA can also provide a useful estimate of prognosis. CEA is neither sensitive nor specific enough to be used in routine screening for possible malignancy in an asymptomatic population. Nor can this test independently establish a diagnosis of cancer, but it can be used as an adjunct to clinical staging methods in known cancer patients. Radioimmunodetection and radioimmunotherapy with anti-CEA antibodies are currently being evaluated. Study of the pathophysiology and metabolism of CEA is needed. CEA remains the prototype tumor marker and is a valuable comparative tool, when investigating the clinical value of other newly developed tests for tumor markers."

This study was set up in 1973, and represents the largest series of patients published on this topic. It was primarily prospective, 468 patients being entered at the time of, or after the initial diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma. Follow-up was for at least 2 years, and both initially and throughout the follow-up the clinician treating the patient was kept ""blind"" to the patient's plasma CEA level. The general conclusion is that the CEA test provides a useful additional tool for the early detection of recurrence in these patients. Sixty-five per cent of patients with recurrence showed a raised plasma CEA level, and over half the patients who developed recurrence had a raised level some time before the disease was detected by other means. A surprising number of patients had a raised CEA level on a single occasion which subsequently returned to normal at the next follow-up and did not seem to be associated with malignancy. The problems associated with this type of study and their limiting effect on interpretation are discussed."

The results were interpreted by a panel of surgeons in order to assess the clinical relevance of using serum Tennessee antigen for monitoring of patients. The serial estimation of serum Tennessee antigen was found to be very variable, difficult to interpret, and clinically unreliable as an accurate marker for the development of recurrent cancer in this group of patients. There are unacceptably high false-positive and false-negative diagnostic rates for serum Tennessee antigen estimations in comparison with serial estimations of carcinoembryonic antigen."
CD011134,0,7116619,0,A direct assay for carcinoembryonic antigen in serum and its diagnostic value in metastatic breast cancer.,"The development of an optimized direct assay for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in serum is described. CEA was purified from liver metastases from colorectal carcinomas, and avid anti-CEA antibodies (Ka 1.0-1.6x10(11) L/mol) were produced in rabbits. Radiolabelling of CEA was performed by the ""Iodo-Gen"" method. Experiments performed in order to characterize antigen-antibody specificity and to work out assay conditions are described. In the separation step of the assay, problems associated with non-specific binding of radioligand were virtually eliminated by using a new solid-phase second antibody, based on monodisperse polymer particles. The clinical performance of the assay is demonstrated by its high ability to detect relapses in patients with mammary carcinoma."
CD011134,0,7103688,1,Correlation of single and serial CEA determinations with the clinical evolution of cancer patients.,"The correlation between CEA results and the clinical evolution of 56 patients with breast and colorectal cancer, was studied. In mammary cancer (41 patients) there was a correspondence of 75% between single initial CEA values and clinical state at the time of the determination. For colorectal cancer patients the correspondence was 80%. A follow up of the patients during 4 years permitted the evaluation of serial CEA results in the prognosis of the disease. Two or more consecutive CEA results with the same significance (increased or normal) correlated better than single values with the clinical evolution of the disease (93% of correspondence). Normal values in patients with active disease were indicative of favourable prognosis; the appearance of single values above normal but below three times the upper normal limit, do not justify changes in the installed therapy. Two or more consecutive increased results are indicative of present or future deterioration of the patient. Cases of non-correspondence between consecutive serial. CEA results and clinical evolution of the patient are considered as ""real false results"" (7%). Serial CEA determination resulted very useful in the follow up of the oncological patient in the frame of other laboratory and diagnostic means, as a part of the periodic clinical control."
CD011134,0,7083148,0,Differential responses to x-irradiation of subpopulations of two heterogeneous human carcinomas in vitro.,"The responses of two heterogeneous human cancer cell lines and their derivative clones to graded single doses of X-rays were examined in vitro. One system consisted of the human colon carcinoma line DLD-1 and two subpopulations (clones A and D). The second system consisted of the human lung carcinoma line (LX1) and four subpopulations (LX1-1, LX1-2, LX1-3, and LX1-9). These subpopulations have previously been shown to be markedly heterogeneous in terms of such characteristics as karyotype, morphology, drug sensitivity, tumorigenicity, and expression of membrane glycoproteins (such as carcinoembryonic antigen and tumor colonic mucoprotein antigen). Exponentially growing cultures were irradiated with graded single doses of 100-kVp X-rays. Survival was assessed using colony formation as the end point, and responses from multiple experiments were fitted to the single-hit, multitarget equation of cell survival. Values for the mean lethal dose (D0, grays), quasithreshold dose (Dq, grays), and extrapolation number (n) were obtained. For the human colon adenocarcinoma system, these values for the three tumor lines were: DLD-1, 0.95, 2.34, and 11.7; clone A, 1.06, 2.23 and 8.20; and clone D, 1.08, 1.89, and 5.80. For the human lung carcinoma system, these values for the five sublines were: LX1, 1.14, 0.19, and 1.20; LX1-1, 0.96, 2.06, and 8.54; LX1-2, 0.98, 0.88, and 2.48; LX1-3, 0.68, 2.05, and 20.3; and LX1-9, 1.12, 0.00, and 1.00. These two human tumor systems therefore exhibit variability in their intrinsic sensitivity to X-irradiation. The data indicate that failure of some human carcinomas to respond to physical treatment modalities can be due to preexisting resistant subpopulations."

CD011134,0,7068816,0,Monoclonal antibody detection of a circulating tumor-associated antigen. II. A longitudinal evaluation of patients with colorectal cancer.,An antigen identified by two monoclonal anti-colorectal cancer antibodies was studied in sera of 85 patients who had a resection of their primary colorectal cancer. Preoperative and postoperative serum samples and sera collected every 3 months for at least 1 year were included in this study. The levels of these antigens were compared to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Sixty-six patients had at least one antigen elevated in the preoperative period. Malignancy recurred in 10 patients. In 8 of these the recurrence could have been predicted by the persistence or rise in antigen levels 3 to 18 months prior to the detection of the recurrence by current clinical methods. The data suggest that the assays for these antigens are valuable prognostic aids for making clinical therapeutic decisions and appropriately stratifying patients for clinical trials.
CD011134,0,7067580,0,"Carcinoembryonic antigen: physician attitudes, patterns of use, and impact upon patient care.","Recent data would limit indications for serum CEA measurement primarily to follow-up of resected colonic malignancy, yet physician attitude and usage patterns may lag far behind current findings. This discrepancy was investigated at our institution, where more than 1100 CEAs costing $71,000 are ordered each year. Of 45 physicians (all MDs ordering a CEA test during a preselected month), over 50% believed the test to be worthwhile in initial detection of colonic cancer, and 69% thought an elevated CEA to be an adequate reason to begin an aggressive workup to rule out cancer of the colon in a nonsmoking, previously healthy patient. Impressions of cost were less than or equal to $30 (50% of true cost) in nearly half of MDs and less than 20% of true cost in a tenth of MDs. Analysis of the medical record revealed that indications of questionable validity (initial detection of cancer together with follow-up of noncolonic malignancy) accounted for the majority of requested CEAs and included the attempted detection or monitoring of 12 different tumor types in addition to its use as a ""general cancer screen."" Patient benefit was realized in none in a random sample of 106 cases (beta = 0.11, power = 0.89 for an assumed benefit of 2%), while management was altered in only one patient as a direct result of the CEA value. It is important that we continue to inform and educate our colleagues about relatively expensive tests that have only limited and specific application."
CD011134,0,7067557,1,Serial CEA assays and liver scintigraphy for the detection of hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma.,"Of 340 patients with histologically proven colorectal carcinoma, hepatic metastases were diagnosed in 90 (26 per cent), in 50 at the time of initial surgery (synchronously) and in 40 during the post-operative follow-up (metachronously). At the time of initial surgery, plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were markedly elevated in patients with synchronous metastases and normal or only moderately elevated in those with metachronous metastases. During follow-up, CEA levels in the entire group of patients with metastases remained normal in 8 per cent and rose in the remainder: very quickly in 85 per cent and slowly in 15 per cent. Hepatic metastases were diagnosed by strict scintigraphic criteria in 70 per cent of patients and were suggested by liberal criteria in the remainder. During follow-up, hepatic metastases progressed in the scintigraphic image from those defined by liberal to those diagnosed by strict criteria. In two-thirds of the patients, liver scintigraphy proved to be superior to the CEA test in diagnosing hepatic metastases by strict criteria; in the majority of the remainder of patients, the CEA test, particularly in cases with a pattern of fast increase of CEA in plasma, suggested metastases before a definite diagnosis could be made by liver scintigraphy. In only 3 per cent of the patients neither liver scintigraphy nor the CEA test were indicative of metastases. Thus, the two diagnostic modalities, when combined, could attain a sensitivity of 97 per cent, when patients with persistently rising CEA levels and concomitant liver lesions defined by the liberal criteria were grouped with those for whom scintigraphy was unequivocal."
CD011134,0,7065347,0,Postoperative follow-up studies on cancer of the colon and rectum.,"We followed up 790 patients with cancer of the colon and rectum treated at our hospital since 1962. The curative resection rate in the rectum and anus was 78 percent but decreased as the distance of the lesion from the anus increased. In the ascending colon the rate was 59.8 percent. The patients undergoing curative resection had a 5 year survival rate of 65 percent and a 10 year survival rate of 45 percent. The closer to the anus, the poorer the prognosis. Prognosis is greatly influenced by the stage at diagnosis. Surgical results have improved annually due to progress in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Factors greatly influencing prognosis were the presence of lymph node metastasis, the degree of invasion of the intestinal wall and the site of the primary lesion. Lymph node metastasis was an especially important prognostic factor. In cancer of the rectum primary recurrences were most often found in local sites (66 percent of cases), followed by metastasis to the liver and the lung. However, in cancer of the colon metastasis in both the liver and the peritoneum was observed in 67 percent of the cases. On the basis of these results, methods to prevent local recurrence of cancer of the rectum as well as metastasis to the liver from cancer of the colon must be developed. When extended abdominopelvic wide dissection was performed, the incidence of local recurrence decreased."
CD011134,0,7055417,0,Electromyographic evidence of inferior gluteal nerve compromise: an early representation of recurrent colorectal carcinoma.,"Lumbosacral or primary buttock pain and cutaneous anesthesia in the distribution of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve were the initial symptoms in 5 patients later proven to have extensions of previously resected colorectal malignancy. The initial electromyographic impression of an inferior gluteal nerve mononeuropathy associated with recurrent neoplasia was confirmed by a positive colon biopsy in 1 case and widespread pelvic metastasis demonstrated at laparotomy in the 4 remaining cases. Four of the 5 patients also had increased levels of carcinoembryonic antigen. Roentgenographs and other laboratory data were otherwise normal in all 5 cases. Entrapment of the inferior gluteal nerve and the accompanying posterior femoral cutaneous nerves is facilitated by its medial, intrapelvic fixation at its origin from the sciatic nerve and the crowding effect of the piriformis muscle above, the dorsal rim of the sciatic notch behind and the inferior gluteal vessels and nodes below. The demonstration of hypestesia over the inferior lateral buttock and a concomitant history of colorectal malignancy should alter the examiner to the possible presence of an inferior gluteal nerve neuropathy."
CD011134,0,7046656,1,CEA monitoring among patients in multi-institutional adjuvant G.I. therapy protocols.,"The Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) has since 1975 included protocols for monitoring carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in its colorectal cancer adjuvant trials. Among the 563 patients on the colon cancer study (GI 6175) and the 207 patients on the rectal cancer study (GI 7175), one third had preoperative CEA determinations and more than 90% had some postoperative CEA monitoring. Colon cancer patients whose preoperative CEA was greater than 5 ng/ml had a greater probability of recurring than those whose values were lower (33% versus 18% recurrence with 21 months minimum follow-up; p < 0.05). The prognostic value of preoperative CEA was apparent only in patients with Dukes' C1 colon tumors. Preoperative CEA values were not of prognostic significance among the rectal adenocarcinoma patients. Although elevated levels of CEA after resection of either colon or rectum cancers were strongly associated with subsequent tumor recurrence, no single CEA value, arbitrarily defined as ""elevated"", provided an adequate screening test with both high sensitivity and high specificity. Postoperative CEA elevations were more strongly predictive of recurrence when part of a steadily rising trend. In the colon cancer study, the median monthly increase in CEA for disease-free patients was estimated to be zero, and for the relapsed patients 5.8%. The corresponding estimates for patients on the rectal cancer protocol were zero and 7.8%. Only 36 of the 344 disease-free patients on the colon protocol and 14 of the 94 disease-free patients on the rectal protocol (15%) exhibited a rate of increase of CEA as high as 3% per month over the entire period of observation. Two thirds of the relapsed patients on both studies showed a rate of increase this high or higher. The patterns of CEA rise in individual patients were quite varied, however, and monthly rates of increase as established in our study are not to be used as guidelines in patient management."
CD011134,0,7040549,0,Monoclonal antibodies against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) used in a solid-phase enzyme immunoassay. First clinical results.,"A solid-phase enzyme immunoassay using both mouse monoclonal and goat polyclonal antibodies against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was developed. The assay detects 0.6 to 1.2 ng of CEA per ml of serum and has 3 incubation steps which can be performed in 1 day. Polystyrene balls coated with polyclonal goat anti-CEA antibodies are first incubated with heat-extracted serum samples. Bound CEA is then detected by addition of mouse monoclonal antibodies, followed by goat IgG anti-mouse IgG1 coupled to alkaline phosphatase. Results with this enzyme immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies (M-EIA) have been compared with those obtained by the conventional inhibition radioimmunoassay (RIA) using goat antiserum. Three hundred and eighty serum samples from 167 patients with malignant or non-malignant diseases and from 134 normal individuals with or without heavy smoking habits were analyzed by the 2 assays. Excellent correlation between the results of the 2 assays was obtained, but the M-EIA, using monoclonal antibodies from a single hybridoma, did not discriminate better than the conventional RIA between CEA produced by different types of carcinoma and between CEA associated with malignant or non-malignant diseases. Follow-up studies of several patients by sequential CEA determinations with the 2 assays showed that the M-EIA was as accurate as the RIA for the detection of tumor recurrences."
CD011134,0,6956758,1,Carcinoembryonic antigen: usefulness as a postsurgical method in the detection of recurrence in Dukes stages B2 and C colorectal cancers.,"Sequential carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) plasma levels were obtained postoperatively in 181 patients with colorectal Dukes stages B2 and C colorectal cancers to assess their usefulness as part of a follow-up program designed to detect disease progression. In all, 1,684 determinations were obtained in patients who were, at the time, free of any clinical or radiologic evidence of disease. If individual CEA determinations are considered and if 10 ng/ml is specified as the limit between normal and elevated CEA levels, both sensitivity (45.0%) and specificity (93.4%) make determination of CEA levels an acceptable screening test in this well-defined population, especially as it also fulfills the criteria of patient acceptance, potential benefit to the patient, and low cost. Preoperative CEA levels were also determined in 93 of the 181 patients, and these results confirm the prognostic value of the slope between preoperative and postoperative CEA levels."
CD011134,0,6889963,0,Lactosylsphingosine-reactive antibody and CEA in patients with colorectal cancer.,"The sera of 71 patients with colorectal cancer were examined for lactosylsphingosine-reactive antibody and CEA. Fifteen of those patients were studied repeatedly over extensive periods of time. The antibody was determined by the semiquantitative radioimmunoabsorption technique using lactosylsphingosine-polyacrylamide conjugate and [125I]-labelled anti-human IgG. Excessive antibody levels were invariably found In serum samples of all 39-patients who were examined before or within 2 months after surgery. Serum samples of certain patients became negative for the presence of high antibody levels usually between 3 and 6 months after surgery. This occurred in 13 out of 41 operated patients. The follow-up study revealed that 11 such patients have been free of any signs of cancer relapse up until the time of the follow-Up examination, i.e. for 12-28 months, mean 19 months. In contrast, only 4 out of 28 patients who remained positive for the excessive antibody longer than 2 months after surgery are at present free of the disease. The high antibody levels which persist more than 6 months after surgery are almost always associated with cancer recurrences or metastases. This was true for 21 out of 22 such patients. The high levels of the antibody preceded other signs of cancer relapse, including increased concentrations of CEA in about 40% of the operated patients."
CD011134,0,6759373,0,Sandwich enzyme immunoassay using three monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).,"Purified monoclonal antibodies (Mab) produced by 3 hybridomas and reacting with 3 different epitopes of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were used in a solid phase enzyme immunoassay. Two Mabs were physically adsorbed to polystyrene balls and the third Mab was coupled to alkaline phosphatase using the bifunctional reagent N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionate. During a first incubation, CEA from heat-extracted serum samples was immunoadsorbed to the antibody coated balls. After washing of the balls, bound CEA was detected by a second incubation with the enzyme coupled Mab. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.6 ng per ml of serum. A total of 196 serum samples from patients with various types of carcinoma, with liver cirrhosis, or from healthy blood donors with or without smoking habits, were tested. The results obtained with the monoclonal enzyme immunoassay (M-EIA) were compared with those obtained with perchloric acid extracts of the same serum samples tested by an inhibition radioimmunoassay using conventional goat anti-CEA antiserum. There was an excellent correlation between the two assays. In particular, the new M-EIA gave good results for the detection of tumor recurrences in the follow-up of colon carcinoma patients. However, despite the use of exclusively monoclonal antibodies the new assay detected a similar percentage of slightly elevated CEA values as the conventional assay in patients with non-malignant disease, suggesting that the CEA associated with non-malignant diseases is immunologically identical to the CEA released by colon carcinoma."

CD011134,0,6178498,0,Colon-specific antigen-p (CSAp). I. Initial clinical evaluation as a marker for colorectal cancer.,"A radiometric immunoassay for detecting colon-specific antigen-p (CSAp) in the blood of patients suspected of having colorectal cancer has been developed and evaluated in 272 subjects of various disease entities. Using 10 units/ml as the cutoff value for normalcy, the results indicate that the highest number of elevated CSAp titers occurred in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (61%). Only one of 12 colonic adenoma patients had an elevated CSAp titer, and this was slightly above the 10 units/ml cutoff. Other nonneoplastic gastrointestinal disorders showed an 18% abnormal CSAp titer frequency, of which more than half bordered the upper limit of normalcy. CSAp elevations were also found in gastric cancer (20%), pancreatic cancer (20%), breast cancer (5%), and normal individuals (3%). CSAp was compared to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in 44 colorectal cancer patients, in 12 patients with colonic adenomas, and in 62 patients with diverse gastrointestinal disorders. Using a CEA cutoff of 5 ng/ml, CSAp could increase the diagnostic accuracy of the CEA plasma test in colorectal cancer patients by 14%. In patients with colonic adenomas, the CSAp titer was normal when the CEA value was elevated in 25% of the cases. However, both were simultaneously elevated in only 3% of the patients with benign gastrointestinal disorders. Since the CSAp test was less frequently elevated (0-7%) in patients with breast, ovarian, lung, or cervical cancer than was found for CEA (39-75% elevated), it seems that the CSAp blood assay detects colorectal cancer more specifically than the more generally distributed CEA. These results suggest that the combined use of blood CEA and CSAp could enhance the discrimination of colorectal cancers from other nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases, and could also serve to enhance the colorectal cancer-specificity of the CEA assay. Furthermore, serial monitoring of both markers in four advanced colorectal cancer patients indicated that they reflect disease activity, falling after successful treatment and rising again with recurrence and disease progression."

CD011134,0,6173181,1,Predictive value of plasma CEA levels: preoperative prognosis and postoperative monitoring of patients with colorectal carcinoma.,"Plasma CEA levels were determined in 280 patients with histologically proven colorectal carcinoma: in 180 once or twice preoperatively and repeatedly postoperatively, and in 100 postoperatively only. Preoperative levels correlated directly with surgical-pathologic state and inversely with the time of recurrence; i.e., groups of patients with more advanced stage showed higher proportion of elevated CEA levels, and patients with higher levels had recurrences earlier. Levels above 20 ng/ml were strongly suggestive of liver metastases or disseminated disease. Postoperative plasma CEA levels displayed three patterns of variation. 1) Levels fluctuating within normal range, below 3.2 ng/ml, strongly evidenced that surgery was effective, and 2) those fluctuating below 7.5 ng/ml indicated usually nonmalignant concomitant disease; in either group no more than 10 per cent of the patients had recurrences. 3) Levels rising persistently from a postoperative nadir indicated recurrence or, when the rise was dramatic, liver metastases or disseminated cancer in at least 97 per cent of the patients."
CD011134,0,6122762,0,Biological markers as an aid in the clinical management of patients with liver metastases.,"Liver metastases due to the more common neoplastic diseases such as colorectal, breast, or bronchogenic carcinoma are a frequent occurrence and are associated with an ominous prognosis. Earlier detection followed by appropriate therapeutic interventions might have a decided effect on the subsequent course of disease. Controversy exists over the selection of tests with the greatest sensitivity, specificity, and potential utility. Preliminary evidence suggest that gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and 5'-nucleotidase may be of particular significance. Four enzymes--gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, 5'-nucleotidase, leucine aminopeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase plus carcinoembryonic antigen--were compared in the same blood samples from selected patients with breast and small cell carcinoma of the lung. Gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase was the most sensitive test with 28/29 (97%) patients with hepatic metastases having elevated enzymatic activity in their sera. For patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung followed serially, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity was increased an average of 5 months before liver metastases were detected by clinical means. Two factors are important in the interpretation of the results of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase analysis: (1) Hepatic dysfunction due to diseases other than metastatic tumor involvement can cause a rise in enzyme levels as can (2) medications or ethanol which activate the hepatic microsomal drug metabolizing system. Of particular importance, however, is the fact that antitumor chemotherapy, even intensive and multiple agent, did not appear to effect the enzyme activity in the sera of patients with breast or small cell carcinoma of the lung. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in combination with carcinoembryonic antigen may be of particular value in detecting liver metastases and in assessing subsequent response to therapy."
CD011134,0,7466616,0,Are carcinoembryonic antigen levels of value in the curative management of colorectal cancer?,"Although the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is not specific for colorectal cancer, its strong correlation with many aspects of the disease has made it very useful in clinical management of this malignancy. There is controversy, however, about the real value of CEA determinations in the clinical decision-making process and about their impact on patient prognosis. This review analyzes the relative values of the preoperative CEA and postoperative serial CEA levels, the correlation with different patterns of recurrence, and the potential for detecting early recurrence and selecting patients for second-look surgery. Although there is potential for CEA-directed second-look surgery to retrieve patients through resection of early recurrence and possibly to increase the survival rate, the long-term effects on prognosis are yet to be determined."
CD011134,0,7443173,0,Sequential carcinoembryonic antigen levels. A predictor of response and relapse in combination chemotherapy of advanced gastrointestinal cancer.,"Serial determinations of plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were assayed for 34 patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer undergoing 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C combination chemotherapy. 21 patients (62%) had an objective response and the CEA level was decreased in 12. After chemotherapy was initiated a rise in CEA level occurred on the average 6.5 months later, while the mean time to clinical relapse was 8 months. 5 patients (15%) had stable disease; the CEA level was decreased in 2. In 8 patients (24%) with progressive disease, the mean time for a rising CEA level was 3 months. In our view, a change in the CEA level reflects the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer."
CD011134,0,7340729,0,[Evaluation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in patients with neoplasms and hematologic diseases].,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a oncofetal glicoprotein, has been regarded as specific marker for colorectal cancer initially and restricted to the significance of tumor-associated antigen afterwards. Circulating CEA levels were determined in 47 patients with hematologic malignancies, resulting elevated in 10 (21%). The highest values had been discovered in a chronic lymphocitic leukemia complicated by primary hepatoma, causing the problem of the role played by the second tumor, likewise to another CEA-positive patient with the association ""Hodgkin's disease-pancreatic carcinoma"". The CEA employment had not been particularly satisfactory in the therapeutic monitoring and in the early detection of the relapses, in opposition to the results referred in the colorectal, mammary and bronchogenic carcinoma."
CD011134,0,7318628,1,A retrospective study of serial CEA determinations in the early detection of recurrent colorectal cancer.,"In the past five years, routine CEA determinations have been carried out on all patients after curative operation for colorectal carcinoma. These patients also underwent a clinical follow-up examination in the Oncology Outpatient Department. In 86 patients, recurrence of a tumor was confirmed. In 31 cases, a second-look operation was carried out. The CEA determinations were retrospectively analyzed in these patients and correlated with the time the recurrence of the tumor was diagnosed. These results show that of 86 patients only 15 (17.4 per cent) had pathologic CEA values before clinical symptoms of tumor recurrence. In the patient group with local recurrence, only 11 (23.9 per cent) of 46 patients had previously pathologically raised CEA values. Of 31 patients, 15 (48.4 per cent) underwent curative resection after the second-look operation. At this time, 12 patients (38.7 per cnt) still had normal CEA values, whereas only three patients (9.7 per cent) had pathologically raised CEA values. From these results, it was established that early diagnosis of tumor recurrence was very low. Therefore, one should not rely more on postoperative routine CEA determinations in the postoperative monitoring of patients following curative operations for colorectal carcinoma than on regular comprehensive follow-up examinations of these patients."
CD011134,0,7318620,1,Postoperative screening of patients with carcinoma of the colon.,"A prospective evaluation of 149 patients with Dukes' B2 or C colorectal carcinoma, including periodic history, physical examination, chest radiograph, liver function tests, complete blood count, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) radioimmunoassay, barium enema, and endoscopic studies, has been underway since 1976. Thirty-four patients have had recurrence. This study suggests that the history of CEA are the most sensitive noninvasive methods with which to detect recurrent tumors but are unlikely to indicate recurrence at a therapeutically advantageous stage."
CD011134,0,7311186,1,The usefulness and limitations of CEA assay in the management of colorectal cancer.,"We investigated the usefulness and limitations of the measurement of CEA in the evaluation of tumor resection and the detection of recurrence in colorectal cancer patients. Preoperatively, 46 of 90 patients (51.1%) had CEA values of 5.0 ng/ml or higher. The percentage of patients with elevated CEA in whom the CEA values returned to normal one month postoperatively was significantly higher in those who had undergone a curative resection than in those who had undergone a non-curative resection (p less than 0.02). Among patients with normal CEA values, the changes were nil or only slight in CEA values, one month postoperatively. Among 28 with recurrences, 24 (85.7%) had CEA values of 5.0 ng/ml or higher. All 11 with liver recurrences had values of 10.0 ng/ml or higher. In 4 with liver recurrences and in cases where CEA measurements were made, CEA values were found to be abnormal 3 to 10 months before the recurrences and a rapid elevation occurred for a short period. However, 4 out of 10 with local or lymphnode recurrences showed normal CEA values. CEA measurement was useful in detection of liver recurrences, but not so useful in detecting local or lymphnode recurrences."
CD011134,0,7310333,1,Prognostic significance of CEA in colorectal cancer: a statistical study.,"Pretreatment and serial posttreatment carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels were studied with respect to the course of disease in 222 patients with colorectal cancer. The CEA values during the subsequent six years were expressed in actuarial or cumulative plots in relation to tumour-free period, time of diagnosis of recurrence and other parameters. The pretreatment CEA value was highly significant but gave no more prognostic information than the Dukes classification. The pretreatment CEA had prognostic significance only in inoperable patients. Elevated pretreatment CEA did not exclude the possibility of curative treatment. Normalization of CEA after resection did not indicate completeness of cure. In patients with local or distant recurrences CEA occasionally rose before recurrences became clinically apparent. Positive lead time was 0-625 days. However, in about 40% of the patients clinical diagnosis of recurrence preceded a rise of CEA. Maximal negative lead time was 585 days. Statistically, recurrence without a rise of CEA was exceptional. The results strongly suggest that serial CEA determinations cannot replace physical examination and follow-up."

The authors report four cases of gastric carcinoma, one case of colon cancer, and one case of adenocarcinoma of unknown primary in which the patient developed a syndrome analogous to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, consisting of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure without definite evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. In contrast to previous reports, postmortem examination in three of the cases revealed no recurrence or only microscopic foci of residual tumor. In the remaining three, there was clinical and pathologic evidence of grossly disseminated carcinoma. Also in contrast to previous cases, all patients evidenced azotemia and proteinuria at the onset of the syndrome and ultimately uremia was a contributing cause of death. Coagulation profiles showed prolonged thrombin times and elevated fibrin degradation products in four instances and did not distinguish the patients with grossly metastatic disease from those with no tumor or only microscopic residua. Circulating immune complexes containing carcinoembryonic antigen were found in the patient with metastatic colon carcinoma. The syndrome was clinically identical whether or not grossly metastatic tumor was present, and it should not be attributed to advanced disease without definite clinical or pathologic evidence of a recurrence."

While toxic effects were mild with MVF, this regimen appears to have greater activity in advanced colonic carcinoma than therapy with 5-FU alone or in combination with nitrosoureas."
CD011134,0,7265973,0,Correlations between serial CEA levels and surgery in patients with colorectal carcinoma.,Nowadays the evaluation of serial carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels represents an important parameter for the prognosis of patients with carcinoma of the large bowel. Changes in CEA values allow the drawing of conclusions regarding the effectiveness of therapy. We have studied 63 patients with colorectal carcinoma that underwent surgical treatment. Serial CEA levels were tested in each patient before surgery and 15 days after. The 53 patients were considered surgically cured; and among these 7 did not have a significant decrease of CEA values after surgery. The percentage of recurrences among these patients has been 71.4%; meanwhile patients who showed a decrease of CEA values below cutoff values had recurrences only in 17.3% of cases. For this reason is our opinion that patients considered surgically cured who have postoperative high CEA levels cannot be considered really cured from a biological point of view.

CD011134,0,7248444,1,Evaluating serial cancer marker studies in patients at risk of recurrent disease.,"The proportional hazards model of Cox (1972, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 34, 187--220), with a time-dependent covariate, is used to analyze serial cancer marker data. A particular advantage of this method is the case with which missing marker data are handled. Analysis of a real data set shows that high levels of the cancer marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are associated with increased risk of death in patients with resected colorectal cancer. Several aspects of CEA marker history are analyzed, including CEA level at death time t, CEA level 200 days prior to time t, and whether or not CEA exceeded 5 ng/ml prior to t. Methods to test the hypothesis of no marker effect and to give estimates and confidence intervals for model parameters are outlined both for continuous and for grouped time-to-response data. For grouped data a likelihood ratio test of the proportional hazards assumption is suggested."
CD011134,0,7231281,1,Value of serial carcinoembryonic antigen determinations for early detection of recurrent cancer.,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has been monitored at intervals of approximately three months in patients who had undergone potentially curative surgery for breast cancer, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, but who were considered to be at high risk of recurrence. Monitoring of CEA in patients' serum was of no value for the early detection of tumour recurrence in either breast or head and neck cancer patients. It was of value for the early detection of lung cancer recurrence, but these patients were always beyond the scope of cure. In colorectal cancer patients, two-thirds of recurrences were heralded by a rising CEA, but only one of 15 patients had disease confined to local tissues which could be totally excised, although a further three patients had liver metastases which were apparently localized to one lobe of the liver. For colorectal cancer patients, serial CEA estimations are an effective method for the early diagnosis of recurrence, although this seldom translates into improved patient benefit."
CD011134,0,7227130,0,Serum glycoproteins in diagnosis and monitoring of patients with large-bowel cancer.,"The profile of serum glycoproteins is altered in malignancy with a relative increase in acute phase reactant proteins. A prospective study has been performed to investigate three sugar moieties (hexose, hexosamine and sialic acid) of these glycoproteins in the serum of large-bowel cancer patients as a possible guide to recurrence, and to compare these three variables with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The three variables indicated the presence of colorectal cancer in over 65 per cent of 107 cancer-bearing subjects. Furthermore, the appearance of metastatic disease was associated with abnormalities in these variables in 10 of 11 patients, and appears more accurately reflected than with CEA. However, the three variables and CEA are cumulative in their value for predicting recurrent cancer. Monitoring of acute phase reactant proteins may therefore be of potential clinical benefit for monitoring of colorectal cancer patients at high risk of recurrence."
CD011134,0,7226104,0,Second-look laparotomy based on CEA elevations in colorectal cancer.,"Second-look laparotomy was performed in 32 patients who had significant CEA elevations following curative resection for adenocarcinoma of the large bowel. All were asymptomatic, with no demonstrable evidence of recurrence on work-up prior to surgery. Five patients developed subsequent CEA elevations after curative resections at second-look surgery and, while remaining asymptomatic, underwent re-exploration. A total of 37 laparotomies were performed. The CEA level at second-look ranged from 5.1--470 ng/ml with a median level of 25 ng/ml, the time delay ranged from 1--20 months with a median of four months, and the rate of CEA elevation ranged from 0.39--49.05 ng/ml in two weeks with a median of 3.17 ng/ml in two weeks. Recurrent disease was documented in 33 (89%) and four patients had negative explorations (11%). Liver metastasis was evident in 18 with seven curative resections, and local-abdominal disease in 15 with nine curative resections, giving a resectability rate of 43% (16/37). Lower CEA levels, shorter time delays to surgery, and slower rates of CEA elevation were directly related to the resectability rate. The follow-up ranged from 2--61 months, with a median of 15 months. Eight patients are alive and well, 8--61 months, 10 patients are alive with disease 10--47 months; and 14 patients are dead of disease 2--37 months following the second-look surgery. These results suggest a definite role for CEA in selecting patients for second-look laparotomy; however, more follow-up is necessary to document prolonged survival."
CD011134,0,7226032,1,A statistical evaluation of baseline and follow-up carcinoembryonic antigen in patients with resectable colorectal carcinoma.,"A long-term CEA follow-up was evaluated statistically for a series of 74 patients with primary colorectal carcinoma who underwent resections for cure. Thirty-three recurrences and 29 deaths were reported among this population after a median follow-up interval of 55 months. Preoperative CEA levels correlated with the Dukes' classification. However, the preoperative level adds significant information to Dukes' classification in the prediction of recurrence. Postoperative CEA assays taken later in the clinical evaluation process carry the most prognostic information for subsequent recurrence. Using matched-pairs techniques, the authors noted that CEA often rose in anticipation of recurrence, sometimes as early as one year before recurrence. The following four follow-up CEA events were evaluated: 1) three consecutive rising CEA's 2) CEA rises 5.0 ng/ml; 3) CEA exceeds 5.0 ng/ml; 4) CEA exceeds 5.0 ng/ml two consecutive times. The follow-up CEA events examined were characterized by false positive rates ranging from 17% to 66% and true positive rates ranging from 43% to 56% in the prediction of recurrence. From follow-up CEA evaluations, further clinical investigation appeared most warranted when CEA exceeds 5.0 ng/ml at two consecutive follow-up evaluations, but the chances of finding any subsequent recurrent disease was near 50%. Among patients experiencing recurrences, although forewarned by CEA elevations, there was no subsequent time when patients were most likely to have recurrence of disease."
CD011134,0,7226000,0,The relationship of the possible hepatic toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs and carcinoembryonic antigen elevation.,"The value of the serum level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as an indicator of recurrent colorectal carcinoma has been accepted, and the use of serial CEA levels to monitor postoperative chemotherapy has been suggested, However, elevated CEA levels may be associated with nonneoplastic conditions, of which the most difficult to evaluate is hepatic disease. The effect of chemotherapy on hepatic function and therefore on CEA level is not clear. We discuss a patient who, after a potentially curative resection for adenocarcinoma, demonstrated a rise in CEA level in the absence of recurrent carcinoma. This rise correlated with administration of intravenous 5-fluorouracil. Liver biopsy demonstrated severe fatty infiltration with no evidence of cirrhosis. The possible liver toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs must be considered as a factor responsible for the rise in CEA. Simultaneous assessment of hepatic function is essential to the accurate interpretation of CEA levels, especially in patients receiving chemotherapy."
CD011134,0,7222135,0,[Early judgement on the results in radiation therapy of colorectal cancer: determination of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in blood serum at daily intervals from the beginning of irradiation (author's transl)].,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and lactatedehydrogenase (LDH) as tumor cell markers have been determined in the blood serum of 10 patients with colorectal cancer, who underwent preoperative irradiation with 200 to 250 rad daily (total focal dose 2000 to 2500 rad). Daily analysis was made during the irradiation, and, moreover, a determination 2 weeks after the resection of the tumor. Simultaneously CEA and LDH were determined in 10 controls. Serum CEA and LDH levels were found significantly increased in tumor patients as compared to controls. The course was characterized by a peak of LDH on days 4 and 7 from the onset of radiation treatment, while serum CEA did not show a peak in the total of the tumor patients; but in 3 individual patients a peak was detected. In 5 patients, with low CEA values from the beginning, no significant modifications of CEA did appear. Thus, some of the patients undergoing irradiation revealed CEA kinetics conform to theoretical considerations, suggesting a response to irradiation of the colorectal carcinoma. The prognostic value of the early CEA kinetics during radiation treatment should be examined in patients being irradiated for inoperable local recurrence."

CD011134,0,7015005,0,Distribution of carcinoembryonic antigens and blood group substances in adenocarcinoma of the colon.,"Immunoperoxidase techniques were used to localize carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) and human blood group substances (BGS) in 41 adenocarcinomas of the colon and 15 metastases or recurrences of these tumors. Ten primary tumors (24 per cent) were strongly positive for both antigens, 12 (29 per cent) were positive for BGS only, 11 (27 per cent) were positive for CEA only, and eight (20 per cent) contained only microscopic amounts of either. With few exceptions, individual tumor cells contained either CEA, BGS, or neither, but not both. Cancers of the left colon which were positive for BGS were associated with a lower frequency of metastases than were those without BGS (p less than 0.01); tumors lacking both CEA and BGS metastasized more frequently than those tumors containing either or both antigens (p less than 0.01). In tumors of the right colon, there was no significant correlation between antigen content and frequency of metastases. In three cases, the development of recurrent or metastatic tumor was associated with a loss of BGS positivity. The data suggest that immunohistochemical studies of BGS and CEA may be of value in estimating the clinical behavior of certain colon carcinomas."
CD011134,0,7012337,0,Plasma carcinoembryonic antigen levels in ovarian cancer patients: a chart review and survey of published data.,"To evaluate the significance of plasma levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in patients with ovarian cancer, a chart review of such patients from May 1974 to August 1978 was undertaken, along with a literature survey in order to consolidate the data for analysis. The data indicate the CEA levels are consistently lower in ovarian cancer than in colorectal cancer and that the assay is not of value in the primary diagnosis of ovarian cancer. It may, however, be of prognostic significance in that advanced disease and undifferentiated tumors which carry the worst prognoses demonstrate elevated CEA levels with higher frequency. CEA levels may also be of value in assessing the response to therapy and in detecting recurrent disease. Patients who demonstrated good clinical responses to therapy showed a drop to low plasma CEA levels while patients with poor responses showed no decrease or a rise in CEA levels. Moreover, CEA rose again after a postoperative drop in patients with recurrent disease before they demonstrated clinical evidence of recurrence. The relationship of plasma levels to tissue levels of CEA and to histologic type of ovarian carcinoma remains unclear."
CD011134,0,6947782,0,Serum immunoglobulins in colorectal cancer.,"Serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA and IgM) were measured in 75 patients with colorectal carcinoma. The levels of all three immunoglobulins were significantly higher in patients with recurrent colorectal carcinoma compared to those with resectable Duke's B or C colorectal carcinoma, particularly for IgM which was elevated above the normal range in 23 of 55 patients (41.8%). In recurrent disease there was no difference in serum immunoglobulin levels for multiple compared to single metastatic sites, or for patients with heaptic metastases compared to those with non-hepatic metastases. In recurrent colorecial carcinoma, serum alkaline phosphatase was normal in 23 of 55 patients, and serum IgM was elevated in 12 of these 23 patients. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen was normal in 3 of 18 patients, and serum IgM was elevated in two of these three patients. In patients who have had a colorectal cancer resected measurement of serum immunoglobulins, in combination with other screening tests, may be of value in the diagnosis of recurrent disease."

CD011134,0,6167166,0,Correlation of Plasma CEA and CEA tissue staining in poorly differentiated colorectal cancer.,"A review of patients operated on for colorectal cancer disclosed poorly differentiated histologies in those whose preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were no elevated, even in the presence of metastatic disease. CEA was therefore, of little prognostic value or predictive of disease recurrence in these patients. The amount of CEA in tumor tissue of 17 patients with poorly differentiated colorectal cancer was estimated with the immunoperoxidase staining technique and was correlated with histology and plasma CEA levels obtained during various stages of disease. Five tumors did not stain negatively for CEA and all had predominantly poorly differentiated histologies. In all of these patients metastatic disease developed but not elevated plasma CEA levels. In contrast 12 tumors stained positively for CEA and were found to contain either differentiated areas or signet ring cells. Serial plasma CEA levels correctly monitored the postoperative course of all 12 patients. Six of these had a relapse and all were detected by serial increases in plasma CEA. The remaining six were disease free greater than 48 months after resection and had normal plasma CEA levels. Among poorly differentiated tumors, those that contain glandforming areas or signet ring cells can be assumed to produce CEA and plasma CEA levels can be used effectively for monitoring. On the other hand, undifferentiated tumors which do not stain for CEA identify those patients whose plasma CEA levels do not provide a useful monitor."
CD011134,0,6161696,0,Clinical studies of a fast homoarginine-sensitive alkaline phosphatase in patients with cancer.,"The activity of an isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (FHAP) was measured in serum samples obtained from 1692 individual subjects. The median FHAP concentration in patients with untreated or recurrent cancer (2.73 IU/liter) was two-fold higher than in hospitalized control patients with illnesses other than cancer (1.17 IU/liter) and three-fold higher than in healthy control subjects (0.93 IU/liter). Among patients with either breast or colorectal cancer who were clinically disease free following their initial therapy, the median FHAP concentration (1.54 IU/liter) was intermediate between the median FHAP concentration in patients with untreated or recurrent cancer and that of healthy control subjects. In order to illustrate the potential clinical application of FHAP as a diagnostic cancer marker, we have selected a serum FHAP concentration of 2.22 IU/liter as a reference value above which only 3% of healthy control subjects would have a ""positive"" test. Utilizing this reference value, 58% of the patients in the present study with untreated or recurrent cancer would have a positive FHAP test, whereas only 11%, of hospitalized patients with illnesses other than cancer would have a positive test. These data suggest that FHAP may be equivalent to the carcinoembryonic antigen as a diagnostic cancer marker."

CD011134,0,7447529,0,The use of preoperative plasma CEA levels for the Stratification of patients after curative resection of colorectal cancers.,"One hundred forty-five patients with colorectal cancer were analyzed in order to correlate the preoperative plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels with the sites and times of disease recurrence. The median follow-up periods of these patients was 50 months (range 36-72 months). Twenty-one patients were found to have metastases at the time of their operation. None of the seven patients whose primary tumors were classified as Dukes/Kirklin A have had tumor recurrence. Seventeen per cent of the patients with Dukes/Kirklin B tumors have had tumor recurrences, and 63% of the patients with Dukes/Kirklin C colorectal primary tumors have had tumor recurrence. No correlation was found between preoperative CEA values and subsequent risk of tumor recurrence or times to recurrence among the patients with Dukes/Kirklin B colorectal primary cancers. In Dukes/Kirklin C patients, however, elevated preoperative CEA values predicted a higher risk of tumor recurrence. Ninety per cent of the patients (19/21) with preoperative CEA levels greater than 5.0 ng/ml have had relapses, with a median time of 17 months before disease recurrence. Only 39% (9/23) of the patients with Dukes/Kirklin C lesions and CEA levels less than 5 ng/ml have had relapses and there is insufficient follow-up data as yet to determine the median survival time. If those patients whose Dukes/Kirklin C primary tumors were poorly differentiated on histologic examination are excluded, the contrast between patients having CEA levels greater than 5.0 ng/ml and those having CEA levels less than 5 ng/ml is even more marked. Sixteen of the 18 remaining patients whose CEA levels were greater than 5.0 ng/ml prior to curative resection have had relapses as compared with only three of 15 patients whose preoperative CEA values were less than 5. We conclude, therefore, that CEA is an important factor in stratifying patients after curative resection of their Dukes/Kirklin C colorectal tumors."

CD011134,0,7436141,0,CEA--a concept worth exploring.,"We believe patients who have elevated CEA levels before resectioning procedures and who also have documented cancer of the gastrointestinal tract, with a subsequent drop in normal CEA levels postoperatively, should have sequential monthly determinations of colonic embryonal antigens. If there is an increase in levels of concentration, there is at that time justification for surgical intervention. The earlier the detection of elevated colonic embryonic antigen is accomplished, the better are the odds for a successful surgical resection of recurrent disease. The values of the CEA studies define slopes which can identify local recurrence and liver metastasis. For these slope values, it is necessary that the CEA level be drawn regularly. We consider this a promising real clinical advance in that it permits for better utilization of the two significant therapeutic modalities we have for the treatment of cancer of the gastrointestinal tract, namely resectional surgery and radiation therapy. CEA determinations have false positives and limited specificity. It is unfortunate that adult tissues express fetal antigens under conditions wherein there are bursts of cellular activity. This should not diminish the significance of tumor-embryo cross reactivity. This reactivity phenomenon is, in the words of Sir Peter Medawar, ""a now well attested empirical fact,"" and this observation is ""profoundly interesting and potentially important."" The eventual significance of this fact may well transcend current use of the CEA in the diagnosis of recurrent cancer of the gastrointestinal tract."

CD011134,0,7375147,0,Immunohistological patterns of carcinoembryonic antigen in colorectal carcinoma. Correlation with staging and blood levels.,"Forty-four primary adenocarcinomas of the large bowel and 2 liver metastases were stained for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in tissue sections by indirect immunofluorescence. All tumours were positive and showed either one or more of 3 different patterns--luminal; linear at surface of the tumour cells; cytoplasmic. In most cases (83%), two or all 3 patterns were seen in the same or in different parts of a tumour. The immunohistological staining was concordant with preoperative blood levels of CEA in 31 cases (67%) in that 26 tumours showed strong immunofluorescence associated with blood CEA above 2.5 micrograms/l, and 5 showed weak staining and blood CEA values less than 2.5 micrograms/l. However, in 7 strong staining was associated with low blood CEA, and in 8 weak staining was associated with high blood levels. The dissociation between histological and blood CEA findings in 1/3 of the cases, together with the marked variation within the same tumour and differences between one of the primaries and its liver recurrence, suggest that CEA immunohistology is of no better prognostic value than blood CEA levels. There was no association between CEA immunohistology and tumour staging or differentiation. However, blood CEA levels were significantly higher in tumours with extensive local or distant spread (stage D) and in poorly differentiated tumours."

Twenty-seven patients with a history of histologically-confirmed colonic or rectal carcinoma received a high-titer, purified goat anti-CEA IgG labelled with 131-I at a total dose of at least 1.0 muCi. Various body views were scanned at 24 and 48 hours after administration of the radioantibody. Three additional cases were evaluated; one had a villous adenoma in the rectum and received the 131-I-labelled anti-CEA IgG, while two colonic carcinoma patients received normal goat IgG labelled with 131-I. All of the 7 cases with primary colorectal cancer showed true-positive tumor localization, while 20 of 25 sites of metastatic colorectal cancer detected by immune scintigraphy were corroborated by other detection measures. The sensitivity of the radioimmunodetection of colorectal cancers (primary and metastatic) was found to be 90% (true-positive rate), the putative specificity (true-negative rate) was 94%, and the appraent overall accuracy of the technique was 93%. Neither the case of a villous adenoma receiving the anti-CEA IgG nor the two cases of colonic cancer receiving normal goat IgG showed tumor radiolocalization. Very high circulating CEA titers did not appear to hinder successful tumor radiolocalization. These findings suggest that in colorectal cancers the method of CEA radioimmunodetection may be of value in preoperatively determining the location and extent of disease, in assessing possible recurrence or spread postoperatively, and in localizing the source of CEA production in patients with rising or elevated CEA titers. An ancilliary benefit could be a more tumor-specific detection test for confirming the findings of other, more conventional diagnostic measures."

Thirty-seven patients developed proved recurrent tumour in a follow-up period of 2-5 years. Elevated CEA levels were recorded in 36 of these patients and in 27 rising levels preceded clinical symptoms of recurrent tumour. Two distinct patterns of CEA rise were observed: a 'fast' rise in which serum concentrations reached 100 microgram/l within 6 months of the first elevation and a 'slow' rise in which concentrations remained less than 75 microgram/l for at least 12 months. The majority of patients with the 'fast' rise had metastatic spread, whereas most patients with a 'slow' rise had local recurrence alone. This differential pattern may help to predict the site of recurrent tumour."

A postoperative reduction of CEA titer and subsequent re-increase signalize the formation of a local recidivation. -- 3. A rapid increase in the CEA level after postoperatively decreased or constant values indicates the formation of metastases. -- 4.

CD011134,0,7204983,0,A direct competitive binding radioimmunoassay for carcinoembryonic antigen.,"We have incorporated commercially available CEA standard and antiserum into the triple isotope double antibody radioimmunoassay and we have evaluated this assay for the routine determination of CEA. The competitive protein binding (CPB) assay for CEA can be performed directly on serum or plasma without perchloric acid extraction. The assay sensitivity was 0.98 ng/ml, and the day-to-day precision as defined by the coefficient of variation was 12.5% and 13.3% for mean values of 7.6 and 23.9 ng CEA/ml, respectively. The normal range (X +/- 2 S.D.) for CEA determined with the direct CPB method was 3.2--6.2 ng CEA/ml for non-smokers. The upper limit of normal for smokers was 10.0 ng/ml. A method comparison study (Roche perchloric acid extraction vs. direct CPB) showed excellent agreement between the methods for plasma samples containing less than 20.0 ng CEA/ml. The least square analysis parameters were: N = 116, slope = 1.01, y-intercept = 3.5 ng/ml, Sy/x -2.05 ng/ml, and the correlation coefficient was 0.79. Recovery and dilution studies showed no demonstrable non-specific interference due to serum proteins in the direct CPB assay. The clinical significance of the direct CPB assay for CEA was assessed by correlating serial CEA values with the clinical status of patients with breast and colorectal cancer. Increasing CEA values correlated with progressive or recurrent neoplastic disease, and decreasing CEA values correlated with response of the patient to therapy. No false positive direct CPB values for CEA were observed in the clinical study or in the method comparison study. Our laboratory and clinical evaluation demonstrate that the direct CPB method is an accurate and reliable method for the quantitation of CEA. In addition, the method permits high volume analysis and eliminates the hazards to safety that are associated with perchloric acid."

CD011134,0,6446376,0,Percutaneous hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of mitomycin C and floxuridine (FUDR): an effective treatment for metastatic colorectal carcinoma in the liver.,"The response rate of metastatic colorectal carcinoma confined to the liver to HAI of FUDR alone is at the range of 50% and to mitomycin C by hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) at the range of 35%. Mitomycin C was added to FUDR by continuous infusion and given by HAI to 12 patients with colorectal cancer confined to the liver. Catheters were placed subselectively in the hepatic artery, and infusion continued for five to six days when the catheter was removed. Cycles were repeated every 30 days. Chemotherapy consisted of mitomycin C 15 mg/m2 administered on day 1 followed by FUDR 100 mg/m2 by continuous infusion daily for five days. Response to treatment was evaluated by serial determinations of plasma CEA and by imaging techniques consisting of a computerized tomography, sonography, and radionuclide scanning of liver as well as by angiography. In 2 patients, complete remission was achieved; in 4 patients a 75% and in another 4 patients a 50% decrease in liver metastasis was observed, while 2 patients had stable disease. Thus, a response rate of 83% with a median duration of six to seven months was achieved. The median survival of the these patients was 16 months. Eight of the 12 patients have failed previous, i.v. 5-FU containing regimens. Complications related to 45 treatment cycles were the following: catheter displacement in 11.1%, an intimal tear, usually in the hepatic artery in 4.4%, gastric ulcerations in 5.4%, and septicemia in 2.7% of the cycles. In addition, aneurysmal dilation of the hepatic artery occurred in 4 patients (8.8% of the treatment cycles), all of whom continued treatment. Chemotherapy-related complications included primarily thrombocytopenia and stomatitis. Mitomycin C + FUDR by hepatic arterial infusion is an effective treatment for colorectal carcinoma metastatic to the liver. The high response rate justifies the adjuvant treatment of Dukes class C colon cancer patients with this treatment."

CEA-titer (author's transl)].,"The records of 70 patients undergoing a curative anterior resection at the Surgical Department of the Academic Teaching Hospital in Herford for carcinoma of the rectum between January 1, 1974 and December 31, 1978 were reviewed. There were 6 cases (8,5%) developing suture line and local recurrence between 9 and 16.5 months after anterior resection. In this study a rising CEA-titer was the first evidence of recurrence in only 29% of our patients. Among 9 patients with confirmed local recurrence - 6 from our own and 3 from outside - only 2 (22%) showed an increase in CEA levels above normal. In the face of the poor 5-year survival with secondary abdomino-perineal resection following anterior resection one must ask if the significance of those operative procedures with their technical difficulty is justified. Our own experience of 9 patients with secondary abdominoperineal resection for local recurrence has changed our mind for a more palliative operative procedure in such cases."
CD011134,0,6156364,0,Value of serial CEA determinations in a surgical adjuvant trial of colorectal and gastric carcinoma.,"At the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, a concurrently controlled, randomized, prospective surgical adjuvant trial involving Dukes' B2 and C colorectal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma (T1-4, No-2, Mo) has been activated for the last two years. To date, a total of 150 patients have been entered into the three arms of the trial (namely control, immunotherapy, and chemoimmunotherapy). Of these, 127 cases are colorectal carcinoma and 28 are gastric cancer. As part of the protocol, serial CEA determinations are obtained in all patients on a regular three-monthly basis. So far, 28 patients have confirmed recurrence (colorectal 20, gastric 8) demonstrated clinically or radiologically. Out of these 28 patients, 25 (89.2%) had CEA greater than 2.5 ng/ml months before actual demonstration of recurrence. However, if one uses a cutoff of 5.0 ng/ml as significant, that is, one standard deviation from the usual accepted value, then 21 out of 28 (75%) had persistent, elevated CEA's months before the recurrence manifested itself clinically or radiologically. The CEA profiles of three representative cases from each arm of the adjuvant trial are included. It is suggested that serial CEA determinations will be an invaluable adjunctive test in following patients in an adjuvant trial setting."

Of the 38 patients with normal (less than 5 ng/ml) plasma CEA, 27, or 71%, were free of disease two years after surgery. In another 85 patients presenting six months to ten years after resection ""for cure"" of their colorectal carcinoma, normal CEA levels were found in 73, and only five, or 6.4%, of these presented with disease progression when followed for two years; of the 12 patients that presented with CEA values less than 5 ng/ml, disease progression was evident in eight or 67%; in eight patients with CEA levels of greater than 10 ng/ml, the proportion of patients with disease progression increased to 87.5% (7/8). When a patient with a history of colorectal cancer, but seemingly free of disease, presents with levels not only repeatedly above normal (greater than 5 ng/ml) but above the levels found in some nonmalignant conditions (greater than 10 ng/ml), thorough re-examination of the patient to locate the site of possible disease progression is indicated. In 14 such patients further diagnostic methods showed local recurrences in four, metastasis limited to the liver in six, and other metastasis in four. In conclusion, in patients with colorectal carcinoma postoperative elevated CEA plasma levels are a sign of poor prognosis. Consistently elevated CEA levels (greater than 10 ng/ml) are a strong indication of disease progression."
CD011134,0,496566,0,[Incidence and prognosis of metastases in colonic and rectal carcinomas].,In colorectal carcinoma at the time of primary operation a much higher rate of occult micrometastases in the liver is to take in account as it is evident by the frequency of intraoperative found metastases (10--20%. Micrometastases likely can to need 3 to 8 years till they have increased so that the finally stage of generalization is to state. The survival rate of patients with colorectal carcinoma and hepatic metastases -- without therapy of metastases -- is 6 to 8 months and not differs from the survival rate of these patients whose primary tumor was inoperable by local reason. The today usual diagnostic procedures in the postoperative follow up control are able to detect liver metastases in most cases only in an inopportune stage for therapy. Probably the analysis of carcinoembryonic antigen is a progress in this question. The unique chance to block up or eliminate the frequently suspected micrometastases seems to be the general use of a post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy.
CD011134,0,491680,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as prognostic marker in colonic cancer.,"Radioimmunoassay for serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was performed in 49 colonic cancer patients. The test results were positive in 42 patients (85.7%) in whom tumor was present at the time of assay. Preoperatively, CEA level suggested the extent and the prognosis of the disease. Strongly positive CEA test results in such patients correlated with metastatic tumors and poor prognosis. Postoperatively, a positive result for serum CEA indicated presence of residual tumor, while negative results did not exclude residual tumor. Periodic CEA determination in the patients who have undergone resection of colonic cancer may detect tumor recurrence that is at a treatable stage. The data show that patients in whom the immediate postoperative CEA concentration returns to normal have a much lower incidence of recurrent cancer of the colon than patients whose CEA level remains elevated."

Also, morbidity and mortality will be significant. The presence of a rising carcinoembryonic antigen level following a potentially curative operation has been suggested as a more selective indicator for reoperation. Unfortunately, carcinoembryonic antigen levels are a far more sensitive indicator of hepatic metastases, the group usually not helped by operation. Patients with local-regional recurrent carcinoma of the colon and rectum--the group most likely to benefit from reoperation--often have normal carcinoembryonic antigen levels. The importance of patient selectivity for reoperation and the usefulness of the Astler-Coller staging system to define risk factors are stressed."

Elevated CEA level (greater than 5.0) was a good indicator of malignant disease but a poor screening test for cancer because of the high false-negative rate. Degree of elevation of plasma CEA level correlated with incidence of metastatic disease in patients with colorectal, gastric, and breast carcinomas, but no correlation was seen between CEA levels and status of lymph nodes in patients with localized disease. Patients with localized colorectal cancer, but elevated CEA levels before resection, had a 2.1-fold increase in the incidence of recurrence; however, this added to the prognostic value of Dukes' staging only when the CEA level remained elevated postoperatively. In 87% of patients with colorectal cancer, the CEA level was elevated at the time of recurrence, but a therapeutic value of reexploration for unexplained CEA level elevation was not confirmed."

From our experience it ensues that C.E.A. test positivity (C.E.A. greater than or equal to 5 ng/ml, according to the method employed) is higher in colon neoplasms in comparison with gastric neoplasms, in the adenocarcinomas compared with the anaplastic forms. Besides, the study of the relationship with the pathologic stage points out the scanty usefulness of the C.E.A. test in the early diagnosis of gastroenteric neoplasms (Dukes A-B-C1 = 29.2%; CH stage = 88.1%). The use of C.E.A. test during the follow up seemed us of fundamental importance. We observed that: a) after radical surgery, 72% of the patients showed a normalization of C.E.A. values; b) there is a significant relationship between clinical course and C.E.A. as it can predict, sometimes several months earlier, the occurrence of relapses and metastases; c) there is also a close relationship (P less than 0.001) between the modifications of the antigen under chemotherapy and the clinical response. At present, C.E.A. seems to play, above all, fundamental role in choosing a correct treatment after radical surgery or in modifying the chemotherapeutic treatment in non surgical cases or in non radically resected patients."

An elevated level was found in 384 of 518 patients with gastrointestinal neoplasms (74 per cent) and in 162 of 290 patients with other neoplasms (56 per cent). No correlation was found between CEA elevations and tumour differentiation. There was a good correlation between tumour staging and CEA levels for patients with colorectal cancer; the more advanced the tumour, the higher the CEA. Several illustrative cases are presented and the role of CEA assay in the diagnosis and management of neoplasia is discussed.

Many benign conditions may cause elevations of carcinoembryonic antigen, and even far advanced metastatic large bowel cancer may be associated with normal levels. Major treatment decisions should rarely, if ever, be based on plasma levels of carcinoembryonic antigen alone.

The Haemoccult test was positive in 3 of the 11 anastomotic recurrences. Only in cases of distant metastases were values of carcinoembryonic antigen clearly increased (greater than 5 ng/ml).

Although no significant improvements in surgical techniques have afforded improvement in longevity, certain technical factors are known to inhibit tumor implantation during surgery. Data suggest that the extent of en bloc resection is the most crucial factor in avoiding recurrence. Extensive use of radiotherapy as the sole method of treatment or as preoperative or postoperative adjunctive therapy remains investigational, but it seems likely that this form of treatment will play an increasing role in the future. Preoperative radiotherapy seems to be useful in reducing the stage of the neoplasm and the incidence of extraserosal involvement; postoperative radiotherapy is beneficial for palliation. Chemotherapy, particularly with the fluorinated pyrimidines (5-FU and 5-FUDR), is being evaluated for its usefulness in lengthening survival time; response to 5-FU is occasionally dramatic. It remains for major investigational centers to clarify the role of combination chemotherapy in metastatic disease. Immunotherapy at present must be considered an unproven mode of treatment and of inconclusive benefit in any stage of colorectal carcinoma. Carcinoembryonic antigen assay is a useful prognostic and diagnostic tool in localizing primary tumor and in subsequent evaluation of response to treatment."

The panel modification of the direct leukocyte migration test (LMT) has proved to be an excellent monitor in these tumor patients. In this study LMT and CEA-RIA were compared. Peripheral blood leukocytes were pulsed with a high dose (2.5 and 0.5 mg/ml) of 3 m KCl extracts of five different colorectal tumors as well as with one 3m KCL extract of normal colonic mucosa. Patients showing a pathologic migration index (less than 0.80 and greater than 1.17) of 3 or more out of five tumor extracts were considered to be ""positives."" With this test mode 51 of 59 (86%) patients with resectable tumors were reactive, while only 24 of 69 (41%) yielded elevated CEA values. Both LMT and CEA-RIA were positive in 12 of the 13 patients with nonresectable tumors. After curative surgery most patients' leukocyte migration and CEA values were in tne normal range. Of the nine patients with localized tumor recurrence, eight were LMT reactive and five showed elevated CEA values.

Results showed a decrease of mean values of plasma CEA levels from preoperatively to four months after surgery, while eight months after surgery a slight increase was noted. Some of the patients in whom disease recurred showed persistent high levels of CEA, while one patient was consistently a false-negative notwithstanding a bone recurrence.

CD011134,0,726896,0,Determination of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA): comparison of two different assays.,"A comparison was made of CEA determination by the CEA-RIAKIT and our slightly modified CEA-Roche assays. The normal levels (mean + 2 SD) found in 63 blood donors were 2.3 microgram/1 and 3.3 microgram/1, respectively. The inter-assay reproducibility was similar in the range below 15 microgram/1, with variations from 0.3 microgram/1 (1 SD, less than 5 microgram/1) to 1.4 microgram/1 (1 SD, 10--15 microgram/1). Both methods measured CEA concentrations down to 1 microgram/1. The ability of the two assays to discriminate between positive and negative values in patients with urogenital and gastrointestinal cancer was similar. The response to recurrences of colorectal carcinoma was also similar, and the CEA fluctuation was parallel after surgery. The CEA-Roche assay generally showed good correlation between measured and theoretical values at both low and high levels. Under our test conditions, the disparity between indirect and direct values was 14 microgram/1 +/- 8 (n = 4) in the range 18--32 microgram/1, and this must be taken into consideration in interpreting the CEA-Roche test. The CEA-RIAKIT measured too low values as compared to both the CEA-Roche and the theoretical values. The discrepancy increased with increasing CEA values, and the ability to distinguish between high CEA concentrations (greater than 15 microgram/1) was poor. The explanation seems to be that the anti-CEA sera used in this assay show a lower affinity for plasma CEA than for tumour-extracted CEA. Immunochemical differences between sample CEA and CEA used for calibration of the standard curves must be considered in evaluation of CEA assays."

Examples of this latter category include the changes in urinary hydroxyproline output in patients with bone metastases or the altered levels of serum acute phase proteins in neoplasia in general.7 Tumor-derived markers may be produced by either the tumor cell population itself, e.g., CEA, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and other oncofetal antigens, inappropriate hormones such as ACTH etc., or by their supporting framework (stroma), e.g., the osteolysins of human breast cancer.3"

In order to assess its efficacy in monitoring responses to chemotherapy in disseminated disease, 47 patients with documented metastatic colorectal cancer were studied. All had pretreatment CEA determinations and 40/47 (85%) patients had CEA levels greater than 4.0 ng/ml. Patients with hepatic metastases had the highest CEA values and none were found to have levels less than 4.0 ng/ml. Thirty patients received chemotherapy and had serial CEA determinations. 4/30 (13.3%) demonstrated probable tumor regression, 7/30 (23.3%) had stable disease, while 19/30 (63.3%) showed disease progression. CEA titers declined in all four responders, but in only one instance did the level fall to below 4.0 ng/ml and provide evidence of a tumor response not appreciated clinically. The only cytotoxic drugs effecting tumor regressions were 5-FU and 5-FUDR. CEA levels usually rose as disease progressed, but once elevated, absolute values did not correlate directly with tumor burden. The further usefulness of CEA assays in monitoring disseminated colorectal cancer awaits the development of improved chemotherapeutic agents."
CD011134,0,709510,1,The use of serial CEA determinations to predict recurrence of colon cancer and when to do a second-look operation.,"The concept of second-look surgery was introduced by Wangensteen 25 years ago, and 17% of patients were reported to be converted to a cancer-free state. Instead of an arbitrary time interval for reoperation, serial CEA values were used as the indicator of colon cancer recurrence and second-look operation. Twenty-two retrospective and 18 prospective patients were evaluable. There was no operative mortality. The CEA Nomogram was used to determine whether the CEA change was significant. All patient-samples were analyzed in duplicate, stored, and compared with the most recent sample; therefore, each patient served as his own control. The prospective results emphasize the importance of minimizing the time delay between a significant change in CEA values and reoperation. Equally important are the frequency of serial determinations (every one or two months), a thorough understanding of the limitations of the CEA radioimmunoassay, and the clinical condition of the patient."
CD011134,0,709509,0,Pre- and postoperative uses of CEA.,"CEA plasma levels obtained prior to definitive surgery in patients with colorectal cancer in our hands have predictive ability. An elevated CEA greater than 2.5 ng/ml recorded by our laboratory means an increased risk of subsequent local recurrence or of later metastatic disease. The question as to whether or not this is additive as a prognostic variable when tested against careful histopathological staging remains. As a monitor, CEA will detect recurrence. Again, the problem as to how accurate this is remains. If we use two consecutive elevations of plasma CEA greater than 2.5 ng/ml as a criteria, we encounter about 15% false positives which must be weighed against finding disease significantly earlier in about one-third of the patients followed. Our data for second-look procedures indicate clearly that when used in patients with an elevated CEA laparotomy may be useful and further studies showed the presence of disease in 11 of 14 patients with an elevation following surgery for two consecutive tests were greater than 2.5 ng/ml. Two were operable. The significance of these findings is described."

Our previous experience had shown that after curative resection the CEA usually returned to normal levels (less than 5 ng/ml) within one month, but became elevated at time of clinically obvious recurrence being very high in patients with liver metastases, but only moderately elevated or normal in patients with local recurrence. All 16 patients had previously had curative resection of colorectal cancer; 13 in the rectum or rectosigmoid and three in the right colon. There were 13 Dukes' C and three Dukes' B cancers. All had been followed clinically and by CEA testing at three monthly intervals and were considered free of disease (NED) at time of CEA elevation. The median disease free interval was 13 months (range 4-57 months) and the median CEA prompting admission for second-look operation was 21 ng/ml (range 10-56 ng/ml). The sites of recurrence were liver in six, lung in two and localized disease in six. Two patients had negative exploration for recurrence and were found to have cholelithiasis only (one of these later died of metastases). Resection for cure was done in seven and palliative resection or biopsy only was done in nine patients. At this time, four patients are NED (12-37 months), five are living with disease (10-16 months) and seven have died of disease (2-12 months). The CEA test provides a method of early detection of recurrence and may permit surgical retrieval in selected patients and earlier initiation of palliation in other patients.

If these results continue to be substantiated, the carcinoembryonic antigen assay has made a significant contribution in the control of this disease. Serial carcinoembryonic antigen assays should be performed every two months.

The recurrence rate was higher in patients with Dukes' B and Dukes' C lesions who had preoperative levels higher than 5 ng per milliliter. There was a linear inverse correlation between preoperative levels and estimated mean time to recurrence in patients with Dukes' B and C lesions, ranging from 30 months for a level of 2 to 9.8 months for a level of 70 ng per milliliter. In patients with Dukes' C lesions the median time to recurrence was 13 months if preoperative levels were higher than 5 ng per milliliter, and 28 months if they were lower.

The group without preoperative CEA elevation has a statistically significant higher proporation of Dukes A lesions (p less than 0.05), seems less likely to suffer recurrence or have CEA elevation at the time of recurrence, and has a longer disease-free interval, than the group with preoperative CEA elevation. However, no distinction between the two groups can be made on the basis of the patients age, sex, presenting signs and symptoms, or location and size of their primary lesions. Higher postoperative CEA values are associated with liver metastases in both groups."
CD011134,0,647509,0,Immunology and immunotherapy of colorectal cancer.,"Adenocarcinoma of the human colon produce carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), one of a family of glycoprotein molecules that may be produced by various human cancers and, occasionally, by other abnormal tissues. The physicochemical nature and tissue distribution of CEA have been well established and a variety of radioimmunoassays have been developed for the detection of this material in the circulation of patients with CEA-producing tumours. Although the assay should not be used as a screening test for cancer of the bowel, it may serve as a helpful adjunct in the diagnosis of digestive system tumours in conjunction with other routine investigations. More important is the utilization of the radioimmunoassay for CEA under the following circumstances: 1. Preoperatively as an indicator of tumour dissemination based upon the quantitative concentrations of CEA in the circulation. 2. As an indicator of potentially curative resection manifested by a decrease in circulating concentrations of CEA to below detectable limits. 3. As an early warning of recurrent tumour growth, by detecting the reappearance of CEA in the circulation of a patient rendered CEA-negative after tumour resection, 3 months to 2 years or more before any other presently available technology can detect clinical evidence of recurrence. This last observation is now under investigation for its potential value as an indicator for second-look surgery in patients who have undergone potentially curative surgery for colorectal cancers."
CD011134,0,646245,0,Serial plasma carcinoembryonic antigen measurements in the management of metastatic colorectal carcinoma.,"Serial carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) measurements were evaluated in a group of 263 patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Initial CEA levels were not found to be of value in predicting the likelihood of subsequent tumor response. Although a general relation between serial CEA measurements and clinical tumor measurements was noted, these measurements were discordant in a substantial proportion of patients. Tumor measurements as an index of response to therapy were strongly correlated with survival, whereas changes in CEA values and patient survival were not correlated at a statistically significant level. Serial CEA measurements were perhaps of some value in predicting progression of malignant disease, and were roughly comparable to serum alkaline phosphatase assay in assessing response of liver metastasis to chemotherapy. Overall, serial CEA measurements added little to the standard clinical assessment of patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma receiving chemotherapy."

CD011134,0,637196,0,Detection and treatment of recurrent cancer of the colon and rectum.,"A series of 177 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital is examined retrospectively. Two thirds of recurrences were observed by the second postoperative year, and 15% of patients were asymptomatic. Pelvic recurrences were usually attributable to rectal or sigmoid tumors, whereas right-sided carcinomas frequently spread to the liver. The commonest methods of clinical discovery of recurrence included findings of abdominal and pelvic masses, hepatomegaly, and positive chest films. The average survival after discovery of recurrence was only eleven months, but 23 patients having reresections for cure lived an average of thirty-three months. Seven patients (30%) undergoing reresection for cure represented probable cures. Chemotherapy with intravenous 5-FU provided poor palliation, but radiotherapy gave satisfactory relief of symptoms in approximately 50% of patients, particularly those with rectal or low colon lesions. A program of follow-up is offered since there is evidence that even the symptomatic patient may be well palliated or even cured by surgical resection of the recurrence or palliative therapy."
CD011134,0,628054,1,Carcinoembryonic antigen test for recurrent colorectal carcinoma. Inadequacy for early detection.,"Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) tests were performed on 36 patients with histologically proved locally recurrent or residual malignant disease after resection of colorectal carcinoma but with no clinical evidence of distant metastasis. Only nine patients (25%) had abnormal CEA levels of greater than 5 ng/ml despite the fact that most patients had had symptoms of recurrence for several months. Among the nine of our patients, none had CEA values greater than 5 ng/ml, and only three had levels greater than 2.5 ng/ml (3.4, 3.8, and 4.7 ng/ml). The CEA assay is not a sensitive test for early detection of recurrence of colorectal carcinoma."
CD011134,0,364839,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen in patients with breast or colon cancer.,"The rationale and results of clinical use of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) tests in patients with carcinoma of the breast and colon deserve review. Plasma CEA levels have been found to correlate with the extent of tumor invasion and site of metastatic spread, and CEA titers have diagnostic and prognostic value. Although postresectional serial CEA testing is not as useful in cases of breast carcinoma, in cases of carcinoma of the colon it may indicate recurrence or progression of the lesion. However, there are limitations and CEA results should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical information."
CD011134,0,354057,0,Chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy of colorectal cancer. Role of the carcinoembryonic antigen.,"The current status of treatment for patients with colorectal cancer is suboptimal. Although approximately 80% of patients are amenable to surgery, cure is only possible for 40%. Survival of patients is closely related to disease staging at the time of surgery, being poorer for patients presenting with locally advanced disease or with distant metastases. Patients who undergo curative resections and are categorized as having a high risk of developing recurrence, such as those with regionally involved lymph nodes, should be subjected to studies of adjuvant therapy. Although the definite role of such studies is still under evaluation, there already exist studies of chemotherapy with 5FU, chemoimmunotherapy with 5FU-BCG, and radiation therapy, suggesting the beneficial effect of these treatment modalities based on prolongation of the disease-free interval and survival of patients. The status of available treatments for patients with advanced disease is poor. There exists no single or multidrug regimen capable of producing significant tumor regression to improve the patient's quality of life and survival. Accordingly, the active clinical investigation of newer and potentially effective chemotherapeutic agents should continue. The role of present immunotherapy is not fully determined, although several studies suggest its potential usefulness in the adjuvant and the advanced situations. Serial determinations of CEA are extremely helpful in the postsurgical monitoring of patients receiving adjuvant treatments and also in the follow-up of patients undergoing therapy for overt metastatic disease."
CD011134,0,277718,0,Transient carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) elevations following resection of colorectal cancer: a limitation in the use of serial CEA levels as an indicator for second-look surgery.,"In a previous study, other investigators recommended second-look surgery for colorectal cancer primarily on the basis of plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) rises and prepared a nomogram for ready recognition of these ""significant"" increases. We found 25 patients whose CEA levels met the recommended criteria for significance; however, in 9 of these patients the rises were transient. Eight had no clinical evidence of recurrent cancer and they might have had negative second-look surgery had this been done because of CEA rises alone. The use of the CEA nomogram merely eliminated laboratory variation as a cause of the CEA rise. It did not, however, rule out biologic causes of CEA rises, other than that of cancer, especially benign liver disease. We were unable to differentiate benign from malignant rises on the basis of CEA changes alone. Preoperative CEA values helped to separate the two rises. Transient rises usually began earlier. Malignant CEA rises were more likely to be exponential. The rate of rise alone did not discriminate between the two rises. Thus, although serial CEA levels were helpful in making the decision for reexploration, they did not substitute for complete clinical assessment."
CD011134,0,205963,0,Circulating immune complexes in patients following clinically curative resection of colorectal cancer.,"Sixty-nine patients have been followed prospectively after curative resection of Dukes-Kirklin B-2 or C colorectal cancer. Serial plasma samples were studied in selected patients to determine changes in circulating immune complex concentrations (CIC) following primary tumor resection, and to compare serial plasma CIC and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. CIC was determined in an average of seven serial samples per patient by inhibition of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). CEA assays were performed by the Hanson Z-gel method. Two distinct patterns of serial CIC have emerged. In seven patients with no known tumor recurrences, serial CEA levels and CIC oscillated regularly and were inversely related. In seven of eight patients whose tumors recurred, both CEA and CIC rose together. In three patients with elevated plasma CEA levels due to inflammatory bowel disease, serial Ag-Ab complex concentrations did not vary, nor did separated Ag or Ab fractions inhibit ADCC. These data suggest that, in patients following curative resection of colorectal cancer, serial changes in circulating immune complexes may discriminate between transient CEA elevations which occur despite no known tumor recurrence and tumor recurrence which is beyond the capacity of adequate host antitumor defense."
CD011134,0,101294,0,The clinical significance of carcinoembryonic antigen in the plasma and tumors of patients with gynecologic malignancies.,"Carcinoembryonic antigen is elevated in the plasma of approximately 30% of patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma, 50% of patients with ovarian carcinoma, and 60% of patients with cervical carcinoma. The incidence of elevated plasma CEA is directly related to stage of disease, and in ovarian cancer to cell type. Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoretic studies have indicated that CEA from ovarian and cervical cancers is similar to colonic cancer CEA. Tumor staining for CEA by the immunoperoxidase method (indicating a CEA concentration of greater than or equal to 3.0 microgram/g tissue) is positive in about one-half of the patients with elevated plasma CEA levels. However, there is no definite relationship between tumor and plasma antigen levels. Carcinoembryonic antigen levels charcteristically return to normal within 8 weeks following complete surgical removal of tumor. In contrast, antigenemia often persists up to 4 months following curative radiation therapy. A progressive rise in plasma CEA has preceded clinical diagnosis of recurrence in about half of the patients studied. Serial plasma CEA determinations in patients whose plasma or tumors initially contain elevated amounts of antigen provides information concerning the biologic behavior of malignancy which may be of clinical significance to the patient."
CD011134,0,84001,0,A critical comparison of the value of pregnancy-associated alpha2-glycoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen assays in patients with colorectal cancer.,"Absolute serum concentrations of pregnancy-associated alpha2-glycoprotein (alpha2-PAG) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were compared in 54 patients before and after surgery for colorectal cancer. Preoperatively, elevated levels of alpha2-PAG were found in 32 (59%) and of CEA in 35 (65%). Postoperatively, elevated alpha2-PAG levels were found in 10 of 18 patients (56%) without clinical evidence of recurrence whereas elevated CEA levels were present in three (16%). In patients who developed clinical evidence of tumour recurrence, alpha2-PAG levels were elevated in 8 of 13 (62%) while CEA levels were uniformly abnormal. It is concluded that, in this cross-sectional study, measurement of alpha2-PAG concentrations is less reliable than CEA in the detection of tumour recurrence after apparently curative surgery for colorectal cancer."
CD011134,0,929129,0,[The CEA test and other immunological tests as disease course controls in gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma].,"161 patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract were studied to determine the value of the CEA test and a battery of non-specific immunological tests during the course of the disease. The ability of these tests to detect a tumor recurrence in radically operated patients was evaluated. A false negative preoperative CEA value was found in 40% of the patients with gastric carcinoma and 32% with colorectal carcinoma. Patients with a negative preoperative CEA value, and those with only slightly elevated values, had a distinctly better prognosis regarding initial operability and tendency to postoperative recurrence than patients with primarily markedly elevated values. With few exceptions, the development of distant metastases was detected earlier and more easily with the CEA test than by the usual routine follow-up methods. However, in the event of isolated local recurrence the CEA test was positive in only 1 of 5 patients. This reflects the direct correlation between tumor size and CEA elevation. The CEA test is a valuable supplement in the follow-up of patients with gastrointestinal carcinoma."

CD011134,0,832207,0,Prognostic use of preoperative and immediate postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen determinations in colonic cancer.,"Preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentrations are useful in predicting the likelihood of recurrence in patients undergoing curative operations for cancer of the colon. The incidence of recurrence was studied in three groups of patients followed for 6 to 18 months after such an operation: 36 patients (group 1) had preoperative and postoperative plasma CEA concentrations less than 2.5 ng/ml; 11 patients (group 2) had a preoperative CEA value above but a postoperative value below 2.5 ng/ml; and 11 patients (group 3) had preoperative and postoperative concentrations greater than 2.5 ng/ml. Cumulative rates of recurrence at 6, 12 and 18 months after operation were as follows: 0, 3 and 17% in group 1; 0, 9 and 21% in group 2; and 27, 79 and 79% in group 3. Statistically there was no difference in the recurrence rate between groups 1 and 2, but the rate was significantly lower in group 2 compared with group 3. The data show that patients in whom the immediate postoperative CEA concentration returns to normal have a much lower incidence of recurrent cancer of the colon than patients whose CEA concentration remains elevated."
CD011134,0,589555,0,Lack of effectiveness of combined 5- fluorouracil and methyl-CCNU therapy in advanced colorectal cancer.,"Fifty-two patients with advanced colorectal cancer were treated with a combination of 5-Fluorouracil (FU) plus methyl-1,3-cis (2-chlorethyl)-1-nitrosourea (MeCCNU). The treatment schedule program consisted of 5-FU, 300 mg/m2 i.v. bolus, daily for 5 days, repeated at 5-week cycles. MeCCNU was administered at a dose of 150 mg/m2 orally on day 1 of the initial 5-day course of FU and repeated at 10-week intervals. Eighty-four percent (44/52) of the patients with advanced measurable disease developed progressive disease by 4 months or one and a half cycles of therapy. Only two patients had definite partial regression of tumor over the period of observation. The median survival of all patients measured from the onset of treatment was 9 months and is comparable to literature reports of untreated advanced colorectal cancer. This therapeutic trial of combined FU and MeCCNU, employing a dose-schedule distinct from but comparable to previous studies has failed to confirm the substantial response rate reported by other investigators and reinforces the need for exploring new drugs and combinations of drugs in advanced colorectal cancer. The use of sequential plasma CEA determinations as a primary monitor of therapy is discussed in relationship to clinical trials and guidelines for determining significant quantitative changes in plasma CEA levels are recommended."

Twelve of the patients were followed for two years and one for four years. The six patients whose tumours recurred showed positive blood lymphocyte antitumour cytotoxicity and elevated plasma CEA levels at some time from six months after operation, usually well before the recurrence was clinically detectable."
CD011134,0,64132,0,CEA monitoring of palliative treatment for colorectal carcinoma.,"Palliative treatment was applied to 131 cases of unresectable or palliatively resected colorectal carcinoma being monitored with serial CEA determinations. There were 84 instances of disease progression with 67 (80%) of them showing an increase in CEA above pretreatment levels or maintaining high levels, and 17 (20%) showing a fall when compared to pretreatment values or maintaining low initial values. There was a clear-cut regression of the disease in only 9 instances. In all 9, the CEA clearly dropped or maintained low valles throughout the period of regression. No patient in regression had a rise or maintained an elevated CEA level. These changes in CEA followed closely the clinical response of our patient to the use of a particular agent, although for the Nitrosourea compounds there may be a tendency to lower the CEA regardless of the patient's tumor response to the drug. This could be due to the fact that the Nitrosoureas produce a diffuse block of cellular activity, both at the nucleous and cytoplasm; while other compounds act as alkylating agents or by inhibition of enzymes involved in the metabolism of nucleic acids (i.e., 5-FU inhibiting thymidylate synthetase). In general, longer survival was found in those patients who had initially lower levels of CEA as compared to those with high initial levels. The patients with a favorable CEA response to the treatment (falling CEA or maintained low value), even in many who did not show a clinical response had a longer survival than the group with rising or stable high levels. The main value in CEA monitoring of patients resides in its correlation with the amount of disease present and then its ability to detect progression of tumor mass which is not clinically measurable."
CD011134,0,13805,0,Acute-phase reactant protein profiles: an aid to monitoring large bowel cancer by CEA and serum enzymes.,"The profiles of 4 acute-phase reactant proteins (APRPs) (haptoglobin (HPT), alpha1 antitrypsin (AAT), alpha1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) and prealbumin (PALB)) have been studied during the evolution of bowel cancer. Serial measurements of these APRPs can add to the information obtained from measurements of the level of CEA and hepatic enzymes during the monitoring of postoperative patients. There is considerable stability in the profile in a given individual in health, Rises of AAT and AGP are associated with metastases. High levels of HPT may suggest involvement of the bowel wall by recurrent cancer. PALB levels tend to reflect the nutritional status. A discriminant function based on the log CEA, AAT and AGP preoperative blood levels can considerably improve on the predictive value attained using CEA levels alone."
CD011134,0,1247968,1,Carcinoembryonic antigen: clinical and historical aspects.,"To further define and determine the usefulness of CEA, 1100 CEA determinations have been made over the past two years at The Ohio State University Hospitals on patients with a variety of malignant and nonmalignant conditions. Correlation of CEA titers with history and clinical course has yielded interesting results not only in cancers of entodermally derived tissues, for which CEA has become an established adjunct in management, but also in certain other neoplasms and inflammatory states. The current total of 225 preoperative CEA determinations in colorectal carcinomas shows an 81% incidence of elevation, with postoperative titers remaining elevated in patients having only palliative surgery but falling to the negative zone after curative procedures. An excellent correlation exists between CEA levels and grade of tumor (more poorly differentiated tumors showing lower titers). Left-side colon lesions show significantly higher titers than right-side lesions. CEA values have been shown to be elevated in 90% of pancreatic carcinomas studied, in 60% of metastatic breast cancers, and in 35% of other tumors (ovary, head and neck, bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers). CEA levels in 35 ulcerative colitis patients show elevation during exacerbations (51%). During remissions titers fall toward normal, although in 31% still remaining greater than 2.5 ng/ml. In the six colectomies performed, CEA levels all fell into the negative zone postoperatively. Forty percent of adenomatous polyps showed elevated CEA titers (range 2.5-10.0) that dropped following polypectomy to the negative zone. Preoperative and postoperative CEA determinations are important in assessing the effectiveness of surgery. Serial CEA determinations are important in the follow-up period and in evaluation of the other modes of therapy (e.g., chemotherapy). These determinations of tumor antigenicity give the physician added prognostic insight into the behavior of the tumor growth. Rectal examination with guaiac determinations, sigmoidoscopy, cytology, barium enema, and a good clinical evaluation remain the primary tools for detecting colorectal disease. However, in the high-risk patient suspicious of developing cancer, CEA determinations as well as colonoscopy are now being used increasingly and provide additional highly valuable tools in the physician's armamentarium."
CD011134,0,1247300,1,Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a prognostic and monitoring test in clinically complete resection of colorectal carcinoma.,"The prognostic and postoperative monitoring capabilities of the CEA assay were compared to pathological staging of the operative specimens, clinical followup including endoscopy, radiology and scanning techniques, as well as DNCB skin testing and laboratory enzyme determinations (alkaline phosphatase and transaminase). A total of 46 patients with curative resection for colorectal carcinoma were studied. This included 23 patients with recurrent tumors compared to 23 long-term survivors without signs of recurrence at the time of the study. Preoperative CEA determinations were a good prognostic tool comparable to pathological staging of the specimen. Post operative CEA monitoring was the earliest sign of recurrence in 14 of 23 patients and was positive at the time of recurrence determined by other methods in 20; it was negative in only three cases. The incidence of false positive results among the non recurrent group became a lesser problem when repeated elevated values were required before considering the patient as having a recurrence. From these data, it seems reasonable to propose the use of a second-look operation in patients with maintained elevation of circulating CEA and no clinical signs of tumor presence, if we are to treat recurrence at an early stage. Chemotherapy would be an alternative way to deal with this problem, since the absence of clinical signs in general correlate with small bulk of tumor which at this time may be more susceptible to chemotherapeutic agents."
CD011134,0,1064149,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). A prospective clinical trail in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.,"Tests for circulating carcinoembryonic antigen, CEA, in plasma were performed in 29 patients with colonic and rectal cancer, 37 patients with stomach cancer, and in 100 blood donors. Using 5.0 ng per ml as cut off, 48 per cent of the patients with colonic and rectal cancer and 32 per cent of the patients with stomach cancer had elevated CEA-values. The CEA-values could be correlated to the classification of tumours according to Dukes, with significantly elevated values in groups Dukes C and D. The test could reveal 39 per cent of the cases with operable colonic and rectal cancer and 26 per cent of the operable cases of stomach cancer. Five patients with colonic and rectal cancer, and 0 patients with stomach cancer fulfilled the requirements for monitoring. After periods of observation of up to 14 months, definite connection between CEA-values and clinical course could be demonstrated in 1/26 patients submitted to macroscopically radical operation. In 2/7 patients with stomach cancer the CEA-values were entirely misleading. It is concluded that the CEA-test in its present form cannot be recommended for routine employment in patients with gastrointestinal cancer."

As the normal control, the plasma CEA level was examined in 330 apparently healthy individuals and the value was 3.1 +/- 1.1 ng/ml on the average. If the level higher than 4.2 ng/ml could be assumed to be above the normal, 109 out of 198 (55%) patients with malignant diseases were considered to show abnormally elevated CEA values. Based on the above criterion, the CEA titer was abnormally elevated only in 11 out of 60 cases (18%) without cancers. Among cancerous patients, the ones with carcinomas of the digestive tract and the lung exhibited a positive titer of CEA higher than 10.1 ng/ml. When the relationship between the plasma CEA level and histological findings in patients with lung cancer was examined, cases with the adenocarcinoma had more elevated titers than those with any other types of lung cancer. It was also found, by the serial estimation of plasma CEA, that the titer dropped after a successful therapy but elevated again with the recurrence of cancer. Repeated estimation of Cea is thought to be valuable as an indicator for clinical phases of cancer patients."
CD011134,0,1000469,1,Assessment of serial carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assays in postoperative detection of recurrent colorectal cancer.,"Monthly serial postoperative CEA determinations, three-monthly system review plus physical examination, and a battery of six-monthly laboratory and radiologic tests were compared in order to evaluate each in detection of recurrent colorectal cancer. Twelve of the 33 patients studied prospectively developed recurrent disease. In this study CEA was found not to be a substitute for careful clinical follow-up, but if used in a serial manner it was a useful adjunct for detection of early recurrent cancer, especially intra-hepatic and retroperitoneal disease recurring in patients with elevated pretreatment CEA levels. The other laboratory and radiologic tests employed were often useful to confirm progressing disease, but they did not reveal any first evidence of recurrent disease."
CD011134,0,994637,0,[The use of CEA radioimmunoassay for the detection of recurrence of carcinoma of the large bowel (author's transl)].,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a tumor marker defined by specific heterologous antisera. Elevated levels of circulating CEA can be detected by radioimmunoassay in most cases of colorectal carcinoma, depending on the degree of tumor spread. The fact that elevation of CEA level can also be observed in other types of carcinomas and in several nonmalignant conditions greatly limits the value of the CEA test for the early diagnosis of colorectal carcinomas. Repeated CEA measurements and their critical interpretation, however, appear to be of importance after tumor resection for the detection of tumor recurrence during the postoperative follow-up period."
CD011134,0,994514,0,Patterns of serial CEA assays and their clinical use in management of colorectal cancer.,"Through persistent clinical research efforts, the CEA test has developed into a useful although complex disease monitor for colorectal cancer. Although improved or prolonged survival from its use has not been demonstrated, CEA monitoring may allow more knowledgeable patient management. Several reports indicate that postoperative serial CEA assays may identify patients with early recurrence, especially when assays are done frequently. Patients with elevated pretreatment CEA levels usually showed progressively rising titers before other objective evidence of recurrence was apparent. A progressively rising CEA titer correlated well with recurrent cancer, but a normal CEA could not be used as proof of its absence. Persistently elevated CEA titers post-treatment was caused either by persistent disease or by nontumor-related factors. The CEA assay was not a substitute for clinical follow-up but was an adjunct in the diagnosis of eary recurrence. Patients with elevated CEA levels caused by localized disease treated by radiation therapy demonstrated a marked fall in serial CEA levels if all CEA-producing tumor was localized within the radiation portal. The use of pretreatment CEA values plus the pattern of CEA reponse to irradiation may help in the selection of fulguration versus abdominoperineal resection as primary treatment for rectal cancer. Persistently low serial CEA titers after irradiation therapy correlated with disease control. The use of frequent serial CEA assays in patients treated with chemotherapy compared well with other parameters as a monitor of disease progression or regression. When used with other clinical parameters, serial CEA trends appeared to be a useful adjunct in assessing the effectiveness of chemotherapy. A fall in circulating CEA or the stabilization of a rising titer after starting chemotherapy usually indicated an effective regimen, whereas a rising CEA titer may signal may signal the need to initiate or to change chemotherapy."
CD011134,0,970537,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monitoring of radiation therapy for colorectal cancer.,"Serial CEA radioimmunoassays were performed on 16 patients receiving preoperative radiation therapy of rectal cancer or irradiation of recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer. Radiation therapy of localized colorectal cancer reliably reduced previously elevated circulating CEA titers. Significant decrease of elevated CEA titers with accumulating doses of irradiation may indicate that the bulk of CEA-producing tumor is within the radiation treatment portal and assist in patient management decisions. The decrease of circulating CEA with preoperative radiation therapy was of short duration and may indicate that surgical resection should not be delayed more than 6-8 weeks after irradiation. Because of the high frequency of false positive and false negative results, CEA must be used only in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory parameters."
CD011134,0,943151,0,Use of a passive hemagglutination inhibition test for monitoring levels of serum carcinoembryonic antigen following surgical therapy.,"A technique of passive hemagglutination inhibition (PHI) has been used to monitor levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in human sera following surgical therapy. CEA was coupled to human type O-negative erythrocytes in the presence of bis-diazotized benzidine. Pre-operative and post-operative sera from 11 patients with primary adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract and from one patient with ulcerative colitis were then tested for their capacity to inhibit the agglutination of the sensitized cells in the presence of a predetermined amount of goat anti-CEA serum. Positive sera were defined as those which inhibited agglutination at dilutions of greater than 1:8. The pre-operative sera from 11 of the 12 patients inhibited agglutination at dilutions of 1:16 or greater. The one negative serum was from a patient with primary adenocarcinoma of the colon in the stage of Dukes' C. At one month post-resection, the PHI titer of six patients with colon cancer and of the patient with ulcerative colitis was less than or equal to 1:8. However, by 4 months post-resection, all but 3 of the patients had PHI titers in the positive range. These elevated titers were accompanied by recurrence of tumor growth and/or metastatic dissemination. A radioimmunoassay was used to quantitate CEA in 22 of the sera which had been tested by PHI. When positive sera were defined as those which inhibited agglutination at dilutions of greater than 1:8 and contained CEA in excess of 5 ng per ml, the results of the two procedures were in agreement for 17 of the 22 specimens. Five sera, representative of 2 patients with colon cancer, were false negative by PHI."

The 5 patients whose CEA did not fall to below 5 ng/ml showed a subsequent rise in CEA level and later were all found to have a tumor relapse. The results indicate that an incomplete drop in circulating CEA level one month after surgery is a bad prognostic sign. Twenty-two of these patients were followed up by repeated CEA radioimmunoassay for several months after surgery; 8 showed a progressive increase in CEA levels preceding clinical diagnosis of tumor relapse by 2-10 months. The clinical history of these 8 patients is briefly described. The results demonstrate that relapses of colon and rectum carcinoma can be detected by increased CEA levels months before the appearance of any clinical evidence."
CD011134,0,1212660,0,Adjuvant immunotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy in colorectal cancer of the Dukes' C classification. Preliminary clinical results.,"Fifty-eight patients with Dukes' C classification of carcinoma of the large bowel were placed on adjuvant immuno- or chemoimmunotherapy with Bacillus calmette guerin (BCG) or combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus BCG following primary and definitive surgery, and were followed for up to 21 months. Of twenty-six patients receiving BCG alone by scarification, five have relapsed with 75% of freedom from disease estimated at 15.1 months compared with 10.1 months in a group of carefully selected historical controls who had surgery alone (p = 0.12). The survival of all patients receiving BCG alone has not reached the 75 percentile yet, and the difference from controls is currently estimated at the 18% level. The combination of 5-FU plus BCG (studied in 32 patients) may be superior to BCG alone at this time, in that it appears to more effectively protect against tumor recurrence (75 percentile not yet reached compared to control, (p = 0.08). The survival of patients on 5-FU plus BCG also appears to be improved (p = 0.09). No patients have expired compared to a 75 percentile survival of 16.6 months in the control. Serial determination of plasma CEA was crucial in the clinical follow-up of these patients. Frequent CEA detetminations have led to early detection of clinical relapse. In the elevation of CEA suggests tumor recurrence with a high degree of probability in patients with past history of cancer of the large bowel."
CD011134,0,1212650,0,Arylsulfatse B in colorectal cancer.,"Arylsulfatase B activity has been determined in 24-hour urine samples from 243 patients with colorectal cancer. Elevated activity of the enzyme was obsereved in 172 out of 243 (71%) patients. Employing Dukes' modified classification of colorectal cancer, urine arylsulfatase B activity was elevated in Dukes' A lesions-1/8 (12%), Dukes' B lesions-24/43 (55%). Dukes' C lesions-89/111 (80%), and Dukes' D lesions-66/81 (82%). Arylsulfatase B activity in urine, when elevated, may be used to follow response to therapy since in those patients with elevated urine arylsulfatase B values who subsequently responded to therapy, the enzyme values became or approached normal. Urine arylsulfatase B activity also correlated with plasma carcinoembryonal antigen (CEA) as a diagnostic indicator of colorectal cancer in 33/46 (71%) patients. In contrast to the urinary findings, arylsulfatase B activity in tumor tissue was elevated in only 24% (27/110) of the specimens of colorectal cancer. It was also found that in a group of 55 patients treated with 5-fluorouracil, all of the 13 patients that showed objective response to therapy had activities of arylsulfatase B in the tumor tissue within the normal range for large bowel mucosa. Nevertheless, 22 to 26 of the 43 patients that did not respond also presented values in the normal range. The roles of lysosomal enzymes in colorectal cancer are discussed."
CD011134,0,1212528,0,[Clinical use of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) determination].,"The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a tumor marker defined by specific heterologous antisera. Elevated levels of circulating CEA have been detected by radioimmunoassay in 20-90 per cent of cases of colorectal carcinomas depending on the degree of tumor spread. The fact that elevation of CEA level can also be observed in other types of carcinomas and in several non malignant conditions greatly limit the value of the CEA test for the early diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma. Thus, the CEA assay should not be used as a screening test for cancer. Repeated CEA measurements, however, appear to be of importance for the evaluation of tumor resection and the detection of tumor recurrence. The only localized tumors known to produce elevation of CEA above the levels observed in non malignant diseases are carcinomas of the large bowel and the pancreas. In carcinomas derived from other organs a marked increase of CEA level is always associated with the presence of distant metastasis. Therefore at the present time the clinical applications of the CEA radioimmunoassay should be limited to the differential diagnosis of patients with suspicion of primary colorectal or pancreatic carcinoma, to the detection of distant metastasis in other types of carcinomas and to the post operative follow up of patients who had elevated levels of CEA before surgery. Well-controlled studies are still needed to determine if therapeutic decisions based on CEA results can lead to improved survival."
CD011134,0,1202621,1,CEA levels at recurrence and metastases; importance for detecting secondary disease.,"The relation of CEA plasma levels to prognostic factors was studied in 170 patients with various stages of colo-rectal cancer. Several parameters of known relevance for the prognosis were analyzed. Among the patients with involvement of regional lymph nodes at the time of the primary, 53% had a raised CEA value (greater than 5 ng/ml serum) as opposed to 21% when this was not the case (p less than 0.05%). When serosal break-through had occured, 47% of the patients had raised values compared to 21% of those with no serosal break-through (p less than 0.02%). After radical surgery, all patients who remained healthy acquired persistent low plasma CEA, giving the assay a prognostic value. Altogether 20 patients had local recurrences without distant metastases and were thus potential candidates for a re-operation for cure. 70% had raised CEA plasma values, giving the assay a better than expected usefulness in the clinical follow-up, the significance of the difference from operated and healthy patients or healthy control persons being high, p less than 0.001%. The secondary rise in CEA appeared to be unconnected with whether or not the primary tumor had been accompanied by raised plasma CEA. The localization and the histopathological differentiation of the primary tumor seemed to be of less importance for the serum CEA than the dissemination of the tumor."

CD011134,0,1154032,0,Current status of carcinoembryonic antigen assay.,"The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a glycoprotein that can be measured by radioimmunoassay and other immunologic techniques. The CEA reagent is currently commercially available in kit form and has been found to be satisfactory for laboratory use. The highest percentage of elevated plasma CEA and the highest CEA titer have been found in patients with entodermally derived tumors. CEA has also been detected in patients with other tumors and in patients with nonneoplastic disease, as well as in heavy cigarette smokers. The present CEA assay cannot be used to screen for cancer in the general population. The greatest clinical usefulness of current CEA assay is in assessing prognosis, in the detection of residual tumors and recurrent disease, and in monitoring chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The use of anti-CEA antiserum as a tumor-localizing agent may be of potential value in the future."
CD011134,0,1119871,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen and prognosis in patients with colon cancer.,One-hundred and fifty patients with non-metastatic colo-rectal cancer were followed for a period of 24 to 36 months postoperatively. Preoperative CEA values have been shown to correlate with the extent of the disease and the patient's prognosis. The prognosis for recurrences is greater in patients with elevated pre-operative CEA values regardless of the stage of their disease. This tendency to have recurrences is 1.8 times higher in individuals with increased pre-operative CEA levels. This same relationship occurs to a greater or lesser extent at each stage of the disease.
CD011134,0,1111949,1,CEA as a monitor of gastrointestinal malignancy.,"Ninety-four patients with carcinoma of the colon have been followed with serial determinations of plasma CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) levels over a 3-year period using the Hansen assay. Nine hundred twelve CEA determinations have been made in these patients. Plasma CEA levels rose in 90% of the instances of clinical progression documented in these patients. In 30% of patients, this rise indicated progression 6 months or more before it was detected by standard clinical methods. Unfortunately, a few patients never developed elevated CEA levels even though disease clearly progressed. False positive results have also been encountered, with significant elevations occurring in patients who have since remained without evidence of disease for several months. Our data indicate that at least two sequential elevated CEA values, the second being higher, must be a minimal criterion for consideration of possible progression of disease. Even with this standard, we have encountered false positive results in 10% of our patients, indicating recurrence or progression where none has occurred clinically. CEA measurement is of limited usefulness for 30 days after curative surgery, because the elevation of CEA levels due to the original amount of tumor present as well as due to surgery per se may persist for this length of time in a significant number of patients. On the other hand, CEA levels have responded to chemotherapy in close correlation with observed clinical course in those patients with metastatic disease treated in this series. Initial pretherapy CEA values have so far proved to be good prognostic indicators of disease course following complete resection. With an initial CEA value of less than 2.5 ng/ml of plasma, recurrent has been rare (1/20). If the pretreatment CEA was greater than 7.0 ng/ml, it has been the rule (7/9)."
CD011134,0,1080218,0,[Carcinofetal antigens. II. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). (author's transl)].,"CEA is a beta1-glycoprotein (mol. w. approx. 200 000) which in embryonic life is usually found as a cell membrane associated antigen in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and pancreas. Furthermore, it is secreted into body fluids. In healthy adults a very low serum concentration may be found. The clinical significance of CEA lies in its increased formation in primary and secondary adenocarcinomas of colon and rectum and pancreatic carcinoma, where values of 20 ng/ml and more are observed. However, other gastrointestinal (e.g. oesophagus, stomach, gall-bladder) and extragastrointestinal tumors (e.g. lung, breast, urogenital, prostatic, ovarial carcinomas) as well as non-malignant diseases mainly of the GI tract (e.g. hepatitis, cirrhosis, pancreatitis, colitis, diverticulitis) may provoke less frequent and lower increases in the CEA level. Healthy smokers also tend to show a slight increase in CEA concentration. A certain relationship exists between the CEA level and the size and extent of the tumor so that a decrease following operation may account for complete tumor removal, whereas a persistent or recurring increase in the CEA level is highly suspicious of metastases and/or recurrent tumor. Difficulties in proving and purifying CEA are mainly caused by multiple cross-reactions of CEA with other substances, e.g. blood group substances (A, B, Lea, Leb) and normal or other antigens (NGP, NCA, CEX, CCEA 2, NCA 2, CCA-III, FSA, BCGP). The radioimmunoassay is the most suitable method to determine CEA levels in body fluids. The 3 procedures used differ in the precipitation of the specific immune complex by ammonium sulphate (AS), Z-gel (ZG) or a second antibody (SA). Depending on the method, the upper normal limit in serum or plasma corresponds to approximately 2.5 (AS, ZG) or 12.5 (SA) nanogramme/milliliter. CEA determination in the urine is of interest in patients suffering from bladder carcinoma."
CD011134,0,765038,0,Tumor-associated antigens in gynecologic cancer.,"If the study of tumor immunology is to have a profound impact on clinical medicine, certain hypotheses must be proven to be valid. First and foremost, it must be demonstrated that malignant tissue possesses antigenic substances (probably protein moieties) that are unique to that particular malignant process. In addition, these antigenic substances must be very similar in histologically similar tumors. Second, the host defense mechanisms must be capable of reacting to these tumor-associated antigens. The reaction is, of course, necessary in order to develop both diagnostic and therapeutic routes of application. The reaction of the immunologic system to these tumor-associated antigens could be monitored as an early serodiagnostic tool for subclinical cancer, and the cytotoxic reaction holds great promise as an immunotherapeutic tool. The essence of tumor immunologic research can thus be stated in the form of the following questions: 1. Do histologically similar cancers from identical primary sites share common tumor-associated antigens? 2. Does the immunologic system react to these antigens? 3. Can this reaction be assayed on one hand for serodiagnosis and augmented on the other for immunotherapy? Specific antigens have been found in animal tumors and have been divided into two classes: the viral induced tumors, which share common antigens when caused by the same viral agent, and carcinogen-induced tumors, which appear to have unique antigenic determinants for each tumor. In recent years a great many human tumors have been found to have tumor-associated antigens; these include colonic carcinoma, neuroblastoma, melanoma, soft tissue and osteogenic sarcoma, bladder carcinoma and Burkitt's lymphoma. This report includes evidence for the existence of such antigens in adenocarcinoma of the ovary and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. The laboratory evidence that has been presented would suggest that there are both a cell-mediated response and humoral response to the antigenic determinants of these two gynecologic cancers. It would appear that the mediated (lymphocyte) effect is considerably more cytotoxic and definitive than the humoral factors measured. In addition, the allogenic experiments would suggest strongly that indeed (at least with regard to these two cancers) histologically similar cancers from the same organ share common antigenic determinants. The identification and isolation of these tumor-associated antigens appears complex. The complexity is increased when one studies patients afflicted with these cancers for plasma carcinoembryonic antigens. This antigen, which was thought to be specific for adenocarcinoma of the colon, is found in the blood of a significant number of patients with adenocarcinoma of the ovary and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix."
CD011134,0,764963,0,"The present status of DEA in diagnosis, prognosis, and evaluation of therapy.","Despite nonspecificity for the diagnosis of colon cancer, the assays for CEA widely studied to date may be useful in the management of patients with colorectal cancer by aiding detection of colonic cancer and especially of widespread metastases to the liver. Use of serial quantitative measurements may also be useful in determining persistence of residual or metastatic tumor after apparently complete surgical resection, in enabling detection of recurrence at an earlier stage than may be otherwise possible, and in helping to evaluate the effects of chemotherapy, provided that the assays are used only in context with complete clinical and laboratory findings, including cancer staging, histopathologic findings, assessment of liver status, and with appreciation of methodologic complexities. Both the further investigation of the clinical use of CEA and the intensified search for more specific markers are encouraged by the findings to date."
CD011134,0,163585,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen in patients with gynecologic malignancies.,"The determination of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in plasma has been of much interest currently concomitant with the search for an immunologic diagnosis test. Recent reports have shed some doubt on the specificity of carcinoembryonic antigens for gastrointestinal tract malignancies. This report details the plasma CEA values in 341 patients with varying gynecologic malignancies. These studies have demonstrated that plasma CEA is elevated in close to 50 per cent of patients with invasive gynecologic cancer. The incidence of positive values is appreciably higher in the advanced stages of disease. Of particular interest was that 84 per cent (21 of 25) of the patients with recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the cervix had a positive CEA value. Similar results were found in patients with cancer of the vulva, ovary, and endometrium."

In a two-year follow-up period 53 patients developed recurrences or metastases. In 36 of these patients sustained rises in plasma C.E.A. titres occurred synchronously with or between three and 18 months before the clinical detection of recurrences or metastases. The use of serial plasma C.E.A. assays is therefore recommended as an additional diagnostic aid for the earlier detection of recurrent or metastatic colorectal carcinomas.
CD011134,0,4421372,0,Carcinoembryonic antigen in management of colorectal carcinoma.,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (C.E.A.) estimation has been used in the preoperative assessment of colorectal carcinoma patients and has been shown to give a useful guide to the presence of metastatic disease and ultimately to a poor prognosis if the serum concentration is 100 ng/ml or more. C.E.A. has been shown to be a more reliable index of tumour spread than either clinical examination or serum alkaline phosphatase estimation. Raised C.E.A. levels of less than 100 ng/ml do not, however, necessarily imply a poor prognosis. Routine C.E.A. estimation may have a valuable role in the assessment of the colorectal cancer patient by identifying those likely to benefit from postoperative chemotherapy.The test has also been assessed in a group of patients attending cancer follow-up clinics after radical resection of a colorectal tumour. Raised C.E.A. occurred in most of those developing recurrent disease, and in several patients a rising C.E.A. level preceded clinical or biochemical evidence of recurrence. C.E.A. estimation is a superior guide and of clinical importance when applied to the follow-up of the colorectal cancer patient."

The level of plasma-C.E.A. was determined before any treatment in a group of 101 patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum. 71% of all patients and 63% of cases with localised tumour (Dukes A and B) had a preoperative C.E.A. value of 5 ng. per ml. or higher. This limit was reached by only 1 of 90 apparently healthy, non-smoking blood-donors. Among 45 patients for whom a complete tumour resection was reported, all patients except 5 showed a drop of C.E.A. to normal values after surgery. The 5 patients whose C.E.A. did not fall to below 5 ng. per ml. showed a subsequent rise in C.E.A. level and were all found later to have a tumour relapse. The results indicate that an incomplete drop of circulating C.E.A. level one month after surgery has a bad prognostic significance. 22 of these patients were followed up by repeated C.E.A. radioimmunoassay for several months after surgery. 8 showed a progressive increase in C.E.A. levels preceding clinical diagnosis of tumour relapse by two to ten months. 6 other patients showed a moderate increase in C.E.A. levels, suggesting a tumour relapse not yet clinically detectable. The remaining 8 patients showed no increase in C.E.A. level above 5 ng. per ml. and no clinical symptoms of relapse. The results demonstrate that relapses of colon and rectum carcinoma can be detected by increased C.E.A. levels months before the appearance of any clinical evidence."
