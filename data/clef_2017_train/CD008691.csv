CD008691,0,10946031,0,Outcome of coronary revascularization in patients on renal dialysis.,"Previous retrospective studies showed high periprocedure mortality rate and poor outcome after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) among renal dialysis patients. The purpose of this study was to compare mortality and clinical event rates in renal dialysis patients after PTCA or CABG. We identified 252 patients from the Emory Cardiovascular Database who were on dialysis and who received PTCA (122 patients) or CABG (130 patients) at Emory University Hospital and Crawford W. Long Hospital between March 1987 and December 1997. Baseline and angiographic characteristics, in-hospital, and 1-year outcome were compared between the 2 groups. Left main disease and 3-vessel coronary artery disease were significantly more common in the CABG group. There was a higher periprocedure and in-hospital mortality in the CABG group (6.9% vs 1.6%, p = 0.04). Patients in the PTCA group underwent repeat revascularization 11 times more frequently within 1 year (22% vs 2%). At 1 year, mortality was 23% in the PTCA group and 27% in the CABG group, with no statistical difference between the 2 groups. This nonrandomized comparison reveals that PTCA and CABG can be performed in selected renal dialysis patients with an acceptable in-hospital major complication rate; however, 1-year mortality remains high in dialysis patients after coronary revascularization. Therefore, attempts at improving outcome in dialysis patients should focus on the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease before they require coronary revascularization."

However, the incidence of restenosis after balloon angioplasty is significantly higher in haemodialysis patients than in the general population. We performed a retrospective study comparing balloon angioplasty with coronary stenting in haemodialysis patients. We evaluated the long-term clinical and angiographic outcome after successful percutaneous coronary revascularization in haemodialysis patients."
CD008691,0,10551681,0,"The necessity for recognition and treatment of patients with ""mild"" hypertension.","A dramatic evolution has occurred in the past four decades in our underlying knowledge of pathophysiology of the hypertensive diseases and in the availability of myriad pharmacologic agents for control of hypertension. This report provides a current review of antihypertensive treatment interspersed with personal opinions supported by appropriate references. It focuses on the recent national recommendations dealing with the prevention, detection, evaluation and treatment of the disease (JNC-6). Whereas I believe that the height of arterial pressure is of primary importance, it is not the sine qua non explaining all target organ involvement or complications of hypertensive disease. Consequently, all that is classified today as Stages 1 and 2 hypertension (old terminology: ""mild"" and ""moderate"") in terms of blood pressure elevation does not explain all outcomes of disease. Indeed, JNC-6 introduced the new concept of risk stratification for therapy based not only on the height of systolic and diastolic pressure but also on the presence of target organ involvement, comorbidity and other risk factors. However, after considerable advances since the inception of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) in 1972, it appears that we are avoiding our responsibilities and reversing our gains. It is of vital importance that we renew our efforts to identify, evaluate and treat all patients with hypertension; this is especially so for the vast numbers of patients with Stages 1 and 2 hypertension."

From July 2001 to June 2006, 3,637 patients with multivessel coronary disease underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass, and 3,586 patients had on-pump coronary artery bypass in our center. The rates of operative mortality, permanent stroke, renal failure and perioperative myocardial infarction were significantly lower in the off-pump group, and these patients required fewer blood transfusions, shorter durations of ventilatory support, and shorter hospital stays. However, the patients who underwent on-pump coronary artery bypass were considered more high-risk and tended to have more complex procedures."

CD008691,0,20090315,0,Magnesium in chronic kidney disease: challenges and opportunities.,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic kidney disease, which is partly explained by the fact that 40-70% of patients receiving dialysis have significant coronary artery disease. Recent clinical studies have shown that lower serum magnesium (Mg) levels are associated with vascular calcification and cardiovascular mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). On the other hand, hypermagnesemia inhibits parathyroid hormone secretion, which is considered an important independent risk factor for vascular calcification, left ventricular hypertrophy and mortality in ESRD patients. Finally, increasing evidence points towards a link between Mg and cardiovascular disease, even in subjects without chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this review was to critically review the current literature examining the effects of plasma Mg levels on cardiovascular disease and parathyroid hormone homeostasis in ESRD, and renal transplant patients."
CD008691,0,1331875,0,Ventricular late potentials in haemodialysis patients and the risk of sudden death.,"Cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 50% of deaths in patients on chronic haemodialysis. Therefore we prospectively studied 54 consecutive patients on dialysis for the presence or absence of ventricular late potentials (LP). LP, i.e. low-amplitude potentials in the terminal part of the QRS complex, have been shown to be highly indicative of life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden death. The results were correlated with echocardiographic studies and the clinical outcome during a follow-up period of 18 months. Fifty patients were suitable for evaluation (29 males, 21 females; mean age 55 years; mean time on dialysis 32 months; coronary artery disease present in 5) Our analysis revealed LP in seven of 50 patients only. Left ventricular hypertrophy, i.e. mean wall diameter > 12 mm, was present in 78%, a compromised left ventricular function, i.e. shortening fraction < 28%, was found in 28% of the patients. With respect to echocardiographic parameters, patients with and without LP were similar. During follow-up, sudden cardiac death was observed in three of 11 patients deceased. LP were detectable in one of the three only. From the remaining six patients with LP, four are still alive, and two patients died due to atherosclerosis and pulmonary embolism. Our data underline the crucial role of sudden cardiac death in dialysis patients. Ventricular late potentials, however, are of no prognostic relevance with respect to identification of dialysis patients at risk of sudden death."

This paper reports off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG) in two cases after renal transplantation. The first, a 65-year-old woman, experienced chest pain 5 years after a renal transplantation. Coronary angiography (CAG) revealed stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the first diagonal artery (DB1). OPCABG [left internal thoracic artery (LITA) to DB1 and LAD] was performed. The second, a 67-year-old man, underwent percutaneous coronary intervention in the LAD 10 years ago. He experienced chest pain 2 years after a renal transplantation. CAG revealed restenosis of LAD. OPCABG (LITA to LAD) was performed. The patients' postoperative course was uneventful. OPCABG for a renal transplant patient was safe and useful since it is a less invasive procedure and easily managed perioperatively."

Accordingly, we performed CAC imaging on 46 nondiabetic patients awaiting kidneytransplant. All patients underwent multidetector computed tomography imaging for CAC quantification, and a vasodilator myocardial perfusion stress (MPS) test was performed only in patients with a total CAC score>300 or>100 in a single coronary artery. The mean patient's age was 46+/-14 years and the median dialysis vintage was 33 months (interquartile range 19-53). The median CAC score was 82 (interquartile range 0-700) and correlated with patients' age (p=0.006) and dialysis vintage (p=0.02). Nineteen patients qualified for MPS, but 5 refused the test. Of the remaining 14 patients, 7 patients had normal scans and 7 showed a minimal perfusion defect in the inferoposterior segment of the left ventricle. At the time of writing, 12 patients have undergone successful kidney transplantation without untoward complications. CAC screening does not appear to be associated with silent ischemia in pretransplant patients. Though CAC is extensive in dialysis patients, calcium may be associated with nonobstructive atherosclerotic lesions or calcification of the media layer of the vessel wall."

A 67-year-old Japanese man underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. After the surgery, he underwent coronary angiography via the right femoral artery. Twelve days later, he suddenly developed acalculous cholecystitis and was treated with antibiotics. Gradual deterioration in renal function, purplish discoloration of the distal portion of his toes, and eosinophilia were noted. We performed a skin biopsy and made a diagnosis of CCE. Cilostazol and intravenous heparin improved the symptoms and decreased the creatinine level. We retrospectively studied the clinical features of 36 cases registered with a diagnosis of CCE in the Japanese literature."
CD008691,0,143402,0,Prognostic value of angiography in management of severe acute renal transplant rejection.,"Angiograms of 34 kidney transplant patients with progressive decrease in renal function after multiple doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) were evaluated retrospectively in regard to the prognostic value of angiography. The following parameters were included in evaluation: prolonged arterial washout time, large vessel vasculitis, presence of arteriovenous shunting, poor cortical perfusion as evidenced by non-filling of cortical vessels, poor definition of cortico-medullary junction, and a poor nephrogram. When 1 to 3 of these abnormalities existed in angiogram, 67% of living related donor transplants (LRD) recovered under continued MP-therapy. With 4-6 angiographic abnormalities the recovery rate was reduced to 30%. The overall recovery rate for LRD transplants was 44%. Cadaveric transplants (CAD) had a statistically significant poorer prognosis as evidenced by only 8% recovery rate under continued MP-therapy."

These indices include a reduction in annular systolic velocity (S'), a decrease in early diastolic annular velocity (E'), and prolongation of the time to E'. However, the ability of these indices to detect or exclude CAD in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) is unclear."
CD008691,0,3232411,0,The role of physical activity in the prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases.,"More and more people are turning to exercise as a means of achieving long-term health. The World Health Organization has endorsed this concept. The best available evidence suggests that an employee fitness programme will result in decreased health-care costs, decreased absenteeism and increased productivity for the employer. Regular physical activity is also associated with lower mortality rates. Appropriate physical activity may be a valuable tool in therapeutic regimens for the control and amelioration (rehabilitation) of cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, congenital heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, musculoskeletal disorders, end-stage renal disease, stress, anxiety and depression, etc. Regular physical activity, independent of other factors, reduces the probability of coronary artery disease and early death. Patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease need more intensive preexercise evaluation than those not a risk, and those with known or suspected cardiovascular disease need the most intensive evaluation and follow-up. Participation in vigorous sports activities, such as jogging, swimming, tennis, etc., helps to protect against the development of hypertension, even when other predisposing factors are present. Several studies have been conducted on the use of exercise in the treatment of hypertension. Physical exercise also contributes to the control of body weight. Consideration of the metabolic abnormalities in patients with type II (adult onset) diabetes indicates that they would make excellent candidates for an exercise programme. Osteoporosis is an important health problem for the elderly. The best treatment available at present is prevention, and a high level of physical activity throughout life can result in a larger skeletal mass during old age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008691,0,17488145,0,Approaches to prevention of cardiovascular complications and events in diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus affects about 8% of the adult population. The estimated number of patients with diabetes, presently about 170 million people, is expected to increase by 50-70% within the next 25 years. Diabetes is an important component of the complex of 'common' cardiovascular risk factors, and is responsible for acceleration and worsening of atherothrombosis. Major cardiovascular events cause about 80% of the total mortality in diabetic patients. Diabetes also induces peculiar microangiopathic changes leading to diabetic nephropathy conducive to end-stage renal failure, and to diabetic retinopathy that may progress to vision loss and blindness. In terms of major cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease and ischaemic stroke are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Peripheral arterial disease frequently occurs, and is more likely to be conducive to critical limb ischaemia and amputation than in the absence of diabetes. Although there are a number of differences in the pathogenesis and clinical features of diabetic macroangiopathy and microangiopathy, these two entities often coexist and induce mutually worsening effects. Endothelial injury, dysfunction and damage are common starting points for both conditions. Causes of endothelial injury can be distinguished into those 'common' to nondiabetic atherothrombosis, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, hypercoagulability and platelet activation; and those more specific and in some cases 'unique' to diabetes and directly related to the metabolic derangement of the disease, such as (i) desulfation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) of the vascular matrix; (ii) formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGE) and their endothelial receptors (RAGE); (iii) oxidative and reductive stress; (iv) decline in nitric oxide production; (v) activation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS); and (vi) endothelial inflammation caused by glucose, insulin, insulin precursors and AGE/RAGE. Prevention of major cardiovascular events with the antithrombotic agent aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is widely recommended, but reportedly underutilised in patients with diabetes. However, some data suggest that aspirin may be less effective than expected in preventing cardiovascular events and especially mortality in patients with diabetes, as well as in slowing progression of retinopathy. In contrast, a recent study found picotamide, a direct thromboxane inhibitor, to be superior to aspirin in diabetic patients. Clopidogrel was either equivalent or less active in diabetic versus nondiabetic patients, depending upon different clinical settings.Recent studies have shown that some GAG compounds are able to reduce micro- and macroalbuminuria in diabetic nephropathy, and hard exudates in diabetic retinopathy, but it is as yet unknown whether these agents also influence the natural history of microvascular complications of diabetes. Lifestyle changes and physical exercise are also essential in preventing cardiovascular events in diabetic patients. Available data on the control of the metabolic state and the main risk factors show that careful adjustment of blood sugar and glycated haemoglobin is more effective in counteracting microvascular damage than in preventing major cardiovascular events. The latter objective requires a more comprehensive approach to the whole constellation of risk factors both specific for diabetes and common to atherothrombosis. This approach includes lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and smoking cessation and the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), which are able to correct the lipid status and to prevent major cardiovascular events independently of the baseline lipidaemic or cardiovascular status. Tight control of hypertension is essential to reduce not only major cardiovascular events but also microvascular complications. Among antihypertensive measures, blockade of the RAAS by means of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists recently emerged as a potentially polyvalent approach, not only for treating hypertension and reducing cardiovascular events, but also to prevent or reduce albuminuria, counteract diabetic nephropathy and lower the occurrence of new type 2 diabetes in individuals at risk."
CD008691,0,9190440,0,[Diagnosis of renovascular disease by heart catheterization].,"Atherosclerotic renovascular disease is a common entity, particularly in persons older than 50 years of age and especially in those patients with other evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease. The illness clearly progresses in some patients, and progression rate appears to be highly variable. Taken into account the apparent high prevalence of renovascular disease in older persons, it is possible that this disorder be the cause of end stage renal disease in 5% to 15% of patients currently entering the dialysis program each year. Surgery and percutaneous angioplasty can both improve renal function in patients with renal artery stenosis. We describe a patient in whom the detection of renovascular disease was made accidentally at the time of coronary arteriography. He presented an acute renal failure after use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or contrast media associated nephrotoxicity, and was treated with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty and had a successful outcome."

CD008691,0,10343078,0,Impact of recombinant human erythropoietin treatment on left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac function in dialysis patients.,"The results of anemia correction by recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) therapy with regard to cardiac function and left ventricular hypertrophy in dialysis patients are controversially discussed. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of therapy rHuEPO on cardiac morphology and function in dialysis patients. We studied 11 clinically stable hemodialysis patients with severe renal anemia (hematocrit <27%) and increased left ventricular mass index (LVMi) with no history of coronary or valvular heart disease, systemic disease, severe hyperparathyroidism, hypertension stage 2 or higher, transfusion-dependent anemia, and concurrent rHuEPO treatment. The patients were treated with rHuEPO administered subcutaneously once or twice weekly at a mean dose of 80 +/- 31 IU/kg week until the hematocrit was >30% and underwent a complete Doppler echocardiographic study at baseline and at follow-up (after 12.2 +/- 2.9 months). At follow-up, ejection fraction and fractional shortening significantly increased from 62.7 +/- 13.8 to 67.8 +/- 9. 7% (p < 0.05) and from 35.5 +/- 9.8 to 39.4 +/- 7.1% (p < 0.05), respectively, whereas mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening demonstrated a trend towards amelioration from 1.18 +/- 0. 23 to 1.27 +/- 0.27 circ/s (n.s.). LVMi and morphological data remained unchanged throughout the study. Nevertheless, LVMi changes showed two different behaviors with respect to baseline values: in 6 patients with higher baseline values, LVMi decreased from 229 +/- 36 to 191 +/- 45 g/m2 (p < 0.05), while it worsened in 5 patients with less marked LVMi, increasing from 141 +/- 32 to 186 +/- 40 g/m2 (p < 0.05). Our data demonstrate that partial correction of renal anemia with rHuEPO therapy seems to improve cardiac performance and to induce a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, particularly in patients with greater baseline hypertrophy, ultimately confirming the multifactorial pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy."
CD008691,0,1789122,0,Myocardial capillary permeability for small hydrophilic indicators during normal physiological conditions and after ischemia and reperfusion.,"Myocardial capillary permeability for small hydrophilic solutes (51Cr-EDTA or 99mTc-DTPA) has been measured using intracoronary indicator bolus injection and external radioactivity registration (the single injection, residue detection method). The method is based on kinetic separation of the injected indicator molecules in an extracted and a transmitted fraction of molecules. In open chest dog hearts measurements performed during normal physiological conditions gave mean capillary extraction values of 43.5-47.5% and the corresponding calculated PdS values were 47.1 - 57.5 ml.(100g.min)-1. From these PdS values Pd values between 1.57.10(-5) and 1.92.10(-5) cm.s-1 were calculated, in accordance with values obtained by other methods. Similar data have been obtained in myocardium of patients undergoing coronary angiography. Oxygen derived free radicals seems to participate in reperfusion injury including microvascular alterations. In open chest dogs transitory increases in capillary extraction fraction and PdS for small hydrophilic solutes were seen following 20 minutes of regional myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. This response could be inhibited by treatment directed against superoxide radicals."

This metabolic imbalance is either a relative or an absoulte deficincey of copper characterized by a high ratio of zinc to copper. The imbalance results in hypercholesterolemia and increased mortaility die to coronary heart disease. The imbalance can occur due to the amounts of zince and copper in human food, to lack of protective substances in food or drinking water and to alterations in physiological status that produce adverse changes in the distribution of zinc and copper in certain important organs. Because no other agent, with the possible exception of cholesterol, has been related so closely to tisk, the ratio of zinc to copper may be the preponderant factor in the etiology of coronary heart disease."

CD008691,0,19112833,0,[Genetic predisposition to systemic complications of arterial hypertension in maintenance haemodialysis patients].,"Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of a high morbidity and mortality in patients on renal replacement therapy and is responsible for about 50% of deaths. Hypertension is the main risk factor for cardiovascular events in the general population as well as in haemodialysed (HD) patients. The hypertension in HD patients is caused by excess extracellular fluid volume (ECV) on the other hand hypertension resistant to normalization of ECV may result from the accelerated activity of the systemic and local--vascular renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system (RAAS). RAAS genes are potential etiological candidates for cardiovascular damage. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertensive retinopathy in patients treated with haemodialysis and to evaluate the association between the polymorphism of RAAS genes: ACE I/D, AGT M235T AT1R A1166C, CYP112 (-344) and the systemic complications of arterial hypertension such as hypertensive retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy and also mortality in haemodialysis patients."

Preliminary report.,"In coronary artery surgery, when a poor distal run of can predict an early graft failure, it might be useful to perform the last anastomosis to a low pressure chamber thus creating a small arterio-venous (A-V) fistula. From January throughout December 1984, 4 patients underwent coronary angiography for severe symptoms of angina. The coronary angiography showed multiple stenoses on the left anterior descending (LAD), ventricular branches of the circumflex (CX), and posterior descending of the right coronary artery (PD). At operation the patients received a sequential aortocoronary bypass graft with reversed saphenous vein, plus the creation of a small A-V fistula into the right atrium in order to improve the graft flow and patency. All patients experienced a clinical improvement. No adverse effects have been observed and the patients, controlled clinically with non invasive and in two cases with invasive techniques, showed satisfactory revascularization."
CD008691,0,11269673,0,Coronary artery disease as a definitive risk factor of short-term outcome after starting hemodialysis in diabetic renal failure patients.,"Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes who are receiving dialysis. It is known that cardiac mortality is high in the first year of hemodialysis (HD). The purpose of this study was to clarify the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with diabetes at the initiation of HD, and to investigate the relationship between short-term outcomes after starting hemodialysis and CAD. We performed coronary angiography (CAG), whether or not patient had angina, within one month of initiation of maintenance HD in 17 of 34 consecutive unselected diabetic patients. We studied the two-year survival rate of those with CAD. Eleven patients (65%) were classified CAD-positive. Nine (82%) of these 11 had multivessel disease. Clinical and hematologic factors did not differ significantly between the groups with and without CAD. During the two-year follow-up period, 28 (82%) of 34 patients survived. In patients with CAD the two-year survival rate was 60%. None of the patients without CAD died within 2 years after starting HD. These results suggest that the presence of CAD at the initiation of HD may play a critical role in short-term outcomes after starting HD.

We measured AOPP in the plasma of 392 patients who underwent coronary angiography because of suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) and examined the association between plasma AOPP levels and CAD. We also collected plasma from hemodialysis patients and healthy volunteers for AOPP assay. Plasma fractionation by size-exclusion chromatography was performed to determine the weights of the molecules involved in the AOPP activity. The elution patterns obtained after plasma fractionation by size-exclusion chromatography were the similar in both CAD and hemodialysis patients, but differed from those of the healthy volunteers, whose AOPP levels were low. We also found that, the severity score of CAD obtained by the Gensini scoring system had good correlation with AOPP quartiles. Multivariable regression models revealed that the plasma AOPP level was significantly related to CAD status. This is the first report of an association between AOPP and CAD. AOPP was an independent risk factor for CAD. Oxidative stress is speculated to be associated with the pathogenesis of CAD."

A previous echocardiographic cross-sectional study showed that only 5% of patients with ARVD had normal cardiac structure and function at baseline. In this longitudinal study of the same patient cohort the progression of cardiac dysfunction and factors which predict declining cardiac function in patients with ARVD were delineated."

CD008691,0,17239676,0,Curriculum in cardiology: integrated diagnosis and management of diastolic heart failure.,"Among the general heart failure (HF) population, over half have diastolic HF (DHF). The proportion of DHF increases with age, from 46% in patients younger than 45 years to 59% in patients older than 85 years. The diagnosis of DHF is made by the combination of signs and symptoms of HF with preserved systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction >50%), and evidence of diastolic dysfunction obtained by echocardiographic Doppler examination, invasive hemodynamic evaluation, or an elevation of serum B-type natriuretic peptide. The most common risk factors for the development of diastolic dysfunction and DHF include long-standing hypertension, older age, female sex, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease. Acute decompensation occurs in the setting of pressure overload, volume overload, or superimposed cardiac ischemia. The cornerstones of in-hospital management include blood pressure and volume control, heart rate control, and correction of precipitating factors. Priorities in the outpatient clinic include optimal blood pressure control, maintenance of euvolemia with minimal or no diuretics, and, potentially, use of disease-modifying drugs including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and digoxin. Long-term regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, improvement in diastolic filling parameters, and sustained reductions in B-type natriuretic peptide may be future treatment targets for this condition."

CD008691,0,16408115,0,Mild renal insufficiency is associated with reduced coronary flow in patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have increased risk for cardiovascular events. However, the association between these pathophysiological processes is unclear. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the association between early CKD and coronary microvascular disease in patients with normal or mildly diseased coronary arteries. A total of 605 patients with normal or mildly diseased coronary arteries based on angiography underwent coronary flow reserve (CFR) evaluation using intracoronary adenosine. Patients were divided based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR). CKD was defined as calculated GFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Patients with normal GFR (> or =60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), n=481) had higher CFR compared to those with CKD (n=124, CFR=3.0+/-0.8 vs 2.6+/-0.6, P<0.001, respectively). Patients with abnormal GFR were more likely to be older and of female gender, with greater prevalence of hypertension. Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for the aforementioned risk factors further supported the observed relationship. The current study shows that reduced renal function is associated with attenuated coronary vasodilator capacity in patients without obstructive coronary artery disease. The correlation between low GFR and reduced CFR may suggest parallel alterations in the renal and coronary microcirculation at the early stage of disease. Impairment in both microcirculatory beds may reflect an unmeasured risk factor induced by blunted renal function and add a burden to the increased propensity for cardiovascular events in CKD."
CD008691,0,9753853,0,Elective stent implantation after optimal debulking for complex coronary lesions: acute and mid-term results.,"Between January 1995 to December 1997, 45 patients with complex lesions in coronary arteries were treated by using the strategy of initial debulking with an atherectomy device followed by elective stenting. Their age ranged from 35-73 years (mean +/- SD:53.9 +/- 9.1) and 93.3 percent were males. The lesion morphology was type B1 in 14 (31.1%), B2 in 16 (35.6%) and type C in 13 (28.9%) patients. The choice of atherectomy device, based primarily on the morphology of lesion, was rotational atherectomy in 23 (51.1%) and directional coronary atherectomy in 22 (48.9%) patients. While majority (73.9%) of the lesions treated by rotablation were long, diffuse and calcified, directional atherectomy was preferred for highly eccentric stenoses in large-sized arteries. All patients underwent elective stent implantation after optimal lesion debulking using a mean burr size of 1.74 +/- 0.2mm for rotablation and a 7Fr. atherocath in majority (90.9%) of patients treated by directional coronary atherectomy. Angiographic success was achieved in all, while clinical success was 97.8 percent. One patient died of acute-on-chronic renal failure during hospitalisation. There were no other major in-hospital adverse cardiac events. At a median follow-up of 13 months (range 1-36 months), recurrence of angina developed in 10 (22.7%), out in which target lesion revascularisation was required in 5 (11.4%) and elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery in one (2.2%) patient. The event-free survival as calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 85.8 percent at six, 77.2 at 12 71.7 percent at 18 months of follow-up. In conclusion, optimal debulking before stent implantation provides a larger lumen, and thus eliminates sub-acute stent thrombosis in complex coronary lesions. This strategy also resulted in a high incidence of event-free survival and a low frequency of target lesion revascularisation on mid-term follow-up."

CD008691,0,18946896,0,Nephrotoxicity of iodixanol versus ioversol in patients with chronic kidney disease: the Visipaque Angiography/Interventions with Laboratory Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency (VALOR) Trial.,Iso-osmolar contrast medium iodixanol has been reported to be less nephrotoxic than selected low-osmolar contrast media (LOCM) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with diabetes mellitus. This study compared the nephrotoxicity of iodixanol and the LOCM ioversol in CKD patients undergoing coronary angiography.
CD008691,0,19539072,0,Impact of the definition utilized on the rate of contrast-induced nephropathy in percutaneous coronary intervention.,"Several definitions have been used to assess rates of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Whether the definition influences observed rates of CIN is unclear. The Oxilan Registry was the first-ever prospective analysis of the efficacy and safety of ioxilan (low-osmolar and low-viscosity contrast medium), including rates of CIN assessed by multiple definitions, in PCI. From July 2006 to June 2007, consecutive patients undergoing PCI using ioxilan were enrolled. Serum creatinine (SCr) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were assessed at baseline and 3 to 5 days after PCI. CIN was defined as SCr increase >or=0.5 mg/dl, eGFR decrease >or=25%, SCr increase >or=25%, or the composite. Of 400 patients (age 62 +/- 11 years), 19% were women, 37% were diabetic, 22% were anemic, and 8% had a history of congestive heart failure. Baseline SCr was 1.12 +/- 0.3 mg/dl and 24% had an eGFR <60 ml/min. CIN rates were 3.3% (SCr increase >or=0.5 mg/dl), 7.6% (eGFR decrease >or=25%), 10.2% (SCr increase >or=25%), and 10.5% (composite). Hospitalization was prolonged in 3.4% of patients with CIN and none required dialysis. There were no deaths or severe allergic reactions. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and repeat revascularization each occurred in 0.8%. In conclusion, in this unselected population undergoing PCI, CIN ranged in frequency from 3.3% to 10.5% depending on the definition used and was not associated with in-hospital mortality or substantial morbidity, such as dialysis. The wide variation in CIN and its lack of association with adverse outcomes underscore the need for a standardized, clinically relevant definition."
CD008691,0,19494798,1,Comparison of the prognostic value of dipyridamole and dobutamine myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in hemodialysis patients.,"Screening for coronary artery disease (CAD) in hemodialysis patients is hampered by contraindications and/or limitations of the available techniques in this population. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) using dipyridamole has been considered inaccurate due to abnormally high basal levels of adenosine in uremia that could blunt the vasodilatory response. Since dobutamine may be more reliable, we directly compared the two in patients on hemodialysis. We performed MPS at rest and after separate dipyridamole or dobutamine stress in 121 chronic hemodialysis patients. More numerous, larger, and more intense reversible lesions were induced with dobutamine than with dipyridamole, mainly in the anteroseptal segments. Reversibility with dipyridamole but not dobutamine MPS was independently and strongly related with mortality associated with CAD and with fatal and non-fatal CAD. We hypothesize that the chronotropic action of dobutamine induced alterations of wall motion, leading to spurious perfusion defects, not unlike artifacts seen with left bundle branch block. Our study shows that even though dobutamine induced more pronounced myocardial ischemia than dipyridamole in chronic hemodialysis patients, dipyridamole MPS more accurately identifies patients at high risk for subsequent cardiac death or non-fatal CAD than dobutamine."

CD008691,0,19194569,0,"The association between kidney function, coronary artery disease, and clinical outcome in patients undergoing coronary angiography.","To characterize the association between chronic kidney disease (CKD), mortality, severity of coronary artery disease (CAD), treatment modality of CAD, and type of coronary stents among patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG), we retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of the patients who underwent CAG at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital in Korea between May 2003 and January 2006. CKD was staged using an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from the creatinine value prior to CAG. There were 3,637 patients included. The presence of CAD was 48% in CKD stage 1, 61% in stage 2, 73% in stage 3, 87% in stage 4, and 81% in stage 5. Survival rate gradually diminished for patients with decreasing renal function. No significant differences in all-cause and cardiac mortality were observed by medical treatment, PCI or CABG, in CKD patients with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). CKD patients with drug-eluting stents showed significantly lower all-cause mortality (5.4% vs. 13.3%) and incidence of myocardial infarction (1.7% vs. 10%) than those with bare metal stents. In conclusion, an eGFR is a strong independent prognostic marker among patients undergoing CAG and the severity of CAD increases progressively with worsening renal function."

CD008691,0,7999844,0,Effects of calcitriol pulse therapy per os in CAPD patients.,"Pulse calcitriol therapy (IV or per os) has been efficacious in hemodialysis (HD) patients to inhibit parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, but there are very poor data for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. For this reason, we used calcitriol (C) per os (0.75-1.5 micrograms three times weekly) in 19/54 patients who had PTH > 150 pg/mL (on peritoneal dialytic treatment for 6-114 months, weekly KT/V 2.01 +/- 0.43); 16% were in therapy with calcium (Ca) carbonate, 26% with calcium acetate alone, and 58% with calcium acetate associated with magnesium (Mg) carbonate and reduction of dialysate Ca (CaD) and dialysate Mg (MgD), respectively, to 1.25 and 0.25 mmol/L. In 5 patients (26%), a further reduction of CaD to 0 mmol/L has been necessary, and 3 patients must be considered nonresponders after three months of treatment. In conclusion, the use of calcitriol as pulse therapy (three times weekly), and at low doses, allows a good control of secondary hyperparathyroidism in 85% of patients who are using phosphate binders without aluminum, if CaD is reduced in some patients to 1.25 or even to 0 mmol/L."

CD008691,0,19427449,0,Relation of aortic valve and coronary artery calcium in patients with chronic kidney disease to the stage and etiology of the renal disease.,"Patients with chronic renal failure have increased cardiac calcium loads. Previous studies have investigated the prevalence and quantitative extent of aortic valve calcium (AVC) and coronary artery calcium (CAC) in patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the impact of preexisting atherosclerosis on the calcification burden has not been clarified. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the effect of CKD stage as well as the primary cause of renal failure (atherosclerotic vs nonatherosclerotic) on AVC and CAC. Twenty-two, 13, and 28 patients with stage 3, 4, and 5 CKD, respectively, were included, of whom 24 had atherosclerotic CKD. Patients underwent electron-beam computed tomography to assess AVC and CAC. AVC was present in 27% of patients with stage 3 CKD, in 38% of patients with stage 4 CKD, and in 43% of patients with stage 5 CKD. CAC was present in 77% of patients with stage 3 CKD, in 54% of patients with stage 4 CKD, and in 64% of patients with stage 5 CKD. There was no correlation between CKD stage and the quantitative extent of AVC and CAC. AVC was more frequent (58% vs 23%, p <0.01) and more extensive (median score 43 [range 0 to 494] vs 0 [range 0 to 8], p <0.01) in patients with CKD caused by atherosclerotic renal disease than in patients with nonatherosclerotic causes of CKD. CAC was more frequent (83% vs 56%, p <0.05) and more extensive (median score 437 [range 61 to 1,565] vs 31 [range 0 to 155], p <0.001) in patients with atherosclerotic causes of CKD than in patients with CKD caused by nonatherosclerotic renal disease. In conclusion, the prevalence as well as the severity of AVC and CAC did not vary between patients with stage 3, 4, and 5 CKD. Cardiac calcification, both AVC and CAC, were more frequent and more severe in patients with atherosclerotic causes of renal failure. These results suggest that cardiac calcium is related to atherosclerotic burden rather than to the severity of CKD."

CD008691,0,11576954,0,Hemodialysis in diabetic patients.,"Diabetic nephropathy is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease, and its prevalence and incidence vary greatly from country to country, being highest in the United States and Japan. In the United States, diabetic nephropathy accounts for approximately 40% of patients beginning renal replacement therapy. Type 2 diabetes is the largest and fastest-growing single disease that requires dialytic therapy. Most patients succumb to cardiovascular causes, including coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, sudden death, cardiac failure, and stroke. The survival from cardiovascular complications is relatively better in East Asian countries and to a lesser extent in Mediterranean countries compared with countries that traditionally have higher cardiovascular death rates. Peripheral vascular disease and sepsis contribute to increased morbidity and mortality. Amputation of limbs secondary to peripheral vascular disease in particular has adverse effects on rehabilitation. Asymptomatic hypoglycemia may develop in hemodialysis patients. Such hypoglycemia is not associated with a hormonal balance but is postulated to be due to blunted hormonal response to hypoglycemia. Diabetic muscle infarction is another rare complication attributable to diabetic microangiopathy; magnetic resonance imaging may help in the diagnosis. Risk factors for increased mortality include advanced age, poor glycemic control before starting dialysis, smoking, left ventricular hypertrophy, hypoalbuminemia, and neuropathy, in particular, autonomic dysfunction. In addition to adequate dialysis, it is advisable to achieve tight blood pressure control (at least <140/90 mm Hg and preferably much lower), better blood glucose control (hemoglobin A(1c), <7%), correction of nutritional status, and appropriate foot care."
CD008691,0,20723638,0,A novel percutaneous coronary intervention risk score to predict one-year mortality.,"Clinical and angiographic risk factors associated with adverse outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have been included in previous validated risk scores. Complications after PCI are known to increase mortality and morbidity but have not been included in any model. Records of 6,932 consecutive patients who underwent PCI from 2000 to 2005 were reviewed. Patients presenting with cardiogenic shock were excluded. Logistic regression and bootstrap methods were used to build an integer risk score for estimating risk of death at 1 year after PCI using baseline, angiographic, and procedural characteristics and postprocedural complications. This risk score was validated in a set of consecutive patients who underwent PCI from 2006 to 2007. The following 8 variables were significantly correlated with outcome: older age, history of diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, heart failure, left main coronary artery disease, lower baseline hematocrit, greater hematocrit decrease after PCI, and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction grade <3 flow after PCI. In the validation population (n = 973), average receiver operating characteristic curve area was 0.836. In conclusion, we developed and validated a simple integer risk score, including postprocedural variables that closely predict long-term mortality after PCI. This model emphasizes the significant impact of complications occurring after PCI on long-term outcomes."

The specificity and sensitivity of cardiac troponins for diagnosis of acute coronary diseases in renal failure have been a point of confusion over the past decade, mainly because of moderate elevations of these cardiac biomarkers, commonly observed in patients with chronic renal dysfunction and without any significant myocardial damage. This review discusses the cardiac troponins, their biochemistry, their currently accepted cut-off values and their real significance in chronic renal failure (CRF), concluding that troponins maintain their diagnostic and prognostic values in patients with CRF, being predictive not only of cardiovascular mortality but also of general mortality in this patient group."
CD008691,0,19925289,0,Plasma ghrelin levels are associated with coronary microvascular and endothelial dysfunction in peritoneal dialysis patients.,"Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the main cause of death in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, and endothelial dysfunction (ED) is an early sign of vascular pathology. Ghrelin, a gastric peptide with CV actions, has been shown to inhibit proatherogenic changes in experimental models. However, another peptide hormone, leptin, may mediate deleterious effects on the CV system. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between plasma ghrelin and leptin levels, and their association with coronary microvascular and endothelial functions in PD patients. Twenty-four (14 females and 10 males; mean age 44 +/- 12 yr) nondiabetic PD patients, between 18 and 70 years of age, were enrolled. In addition to demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters, plasma concentrations of ghrelin and leptin were evaluated. Endothelial functions of the coronary arteries were determined by coronary flow reserve (CFR) measurement using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE). A CFR value of < 2 was used as an evidence for ED. When the study group was divided according to CFR measurements as CFR < 2 and >or= 2, there were no significant differences considering age, gender, etiology of renal disease, body mass index (BMI), duration of dialysis, PD modality, PD solution type, history of peritonitis, mean arterial pressure, ejection fraction, and biochemical parameters between the two subgroups. Plasma ghrelin levels (129.4 +/- 82.1 pg/mL) in patients with CFR >or= 2 were significantly higher than those in patients with CFR< 2 (63.3 +/- 35.8 pg/mL) (p = 0.03). However, no significant differences in plasma leptin levels were found between these groups [31.39 +/- 37.81 ng/mL vs. 63.95 +/- 72.83 ng/mL (p = 0.28)]. No correlation existed between plasma ghrelin levels and age, BMI, duration of dialysis, mean arterial pressure, ejection fraction, plasma leptin levels, and biochemical parameters. Decreased plasma ghrelin levels may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis in PD patients by causing ED."
CD008691,0,8037090,0,Complications and long-term outcome after percutaneous coronary angioplasty in chronic hemodialysis patients.,"The objective of this investigation was to assess the acute and long-term outcome after coronary angioplasty in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. Previous studies have suggested a high incidence of restenosis after coronary angioplasty performed in patients with renal failure. Medical discharge abstracts for 8342 patients undergoing angioplasty during a 5-year period were searched to identify all coronary angioplasty procedures performed in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. Procedural and follow-up coronary angiograms were reviewed in a core angiographic laboratory. Hospital records and office visit notes were obtained to assess acute and long-term outcome. Twenty-one patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis had been treated by coronary angioplasty. The 9 men and 12 women had a mean age of 59 +/- 10 years (range 37 to 78 years) and had been undergoing hemodialysis for 6.2 +/- 6.4 years (range 1 to 19 years). Procedural success was achieved in 12 (57%) of 21 patients. Three (14%) patients died; 4 suffered nonfatal myocardial infarctions (19%); 1 (5%) required emergency bypass surgery; and 1 (5%) had abrupt vessel closure without complications. Of the 15 (71%) patients who were discharged with a patent angioplasty vessel, 4 (27%) died and 9 (60%) had recurrence of angina within 1 year. Of 9 patients with recurrent angina, 7 underwent a second angiography, and all showed evidence of restenosis at the previous angioplasty site. The results of coronary angioplasty in these 21 hemodialysis patients suggest a high rate of acute complications and poor long-term prognosis in this subgroup. Other strategies for revascularization should be considered for these patients."
CD008691,0,17173262,0,[Left ventricular hypertrophy in chronic kidney disease].,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH), together with coronary artery disease, has been considered the main target of intervention. LVH is highly prevalent in CKD even in early stages, as compared to general non-selected population. This is mainly due to the multifactorial pathogenesis of LVH in renal patients where both haemodynamic and non-haemodynamic stimuli synergically act inducing either an increase in left ventricular mass or an LV dilation. Anaemia and arterial hypertension seem to be the most important factors. Interventional studies have shown that partial correction of anaemia through epoetin, together with an arterial hypertension successful therapy through renin-angiotensin system acting drugs, such as ACE-inhibitors, were able to induce a LVH regression in CKD. Indeed, the unfavourable outcome in patients with both CKD and LVH, whose survival is reduced and incidence of fatal and non-fatal CV events increased, can be reversed if LVH is regressed by therapy. The most promising strategy in CKD seems to be LVH early diagnosis through echocardiography, the correct screening of risk factors, a LVM longitudinal monitoring through echo, as well as starting treatment in the early stages of CKD, with the aim of improving general and CV prognosis for these patients."

CD008691,0,11136168,1,Informational contribution of noninvasive screening tests for coronary artery disease in patients on chronic renal replacement therapy.,"The prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) is high in patients on renal replacement therapy; therefore, reliable noninvasive screening tests are needed. We retrospectively determined the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) for a history of chest pain, resting and exercise electrocardiography (ECG), thallium dipyridamole scintigraphy, and echocardiography in 42 patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis and 42 patients after renal transplantation who also underwent coronary angiography. In addition, the prognostic power of each test for the occurrence of a cardiovascular event after angiography (therapeutic intervention, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death) was evaluated during a follow-up of 37 months. Forty-three patients had significant CAD on angiography. Angina pectoris had a sensitivity of 65% and specificity of 66%, corresponding to a positive LR of 1.9 and a negative LR of 0.5. A variable number of patients underwent noninvasive tests before angiography. Results were similar in patients undergoing hemodialysis and after renal transplantation and in patients with or without angina pectoris. Exercise ECG could not be performed in the majority of patients, and resting ECG (sensitivity, 67%; specificity, 52%; corresponding to a positive LR of 1.4 and negative LR of 0.6) and scintigraphy (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 37%; positive LR, 1.3; negative LR, 0.5) in patients on renal replacement therapy were not useful for the diagnosis of CAD. Angina also markedly increased the relative odds for the occurrence of a cardiovascular event during follow-up (relative odds, 4.6) compared with other noninvasive tests. Angina pectoris had the best informational and prognostic value of noninvasive screening methods, but angiography seems to be the only method to clearly document CAD in patients on renal replacement therapy."
CD008691,0,3275808,0,Multicenter prospective study of nonruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. I. Population and operative management.,"This article describes the patient population and operative management of 666 patients with nonruptured aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. Statistical significance of variables was determined by the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. There were no statistically significant differences (p greater than 0.05) in mortality rate for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) on the basis of indication for surgery (asymptomatic, 3.9%; asymptomatic but with evidence of enlargement, 4.9%; and symptomatic, 7.2%) or the urgency of operation (elective operation, 4.5%; and urgent operation, 7.1%). Characteristics of the 72 participating surgeons did not influence the operative mortality rate. A family history of AAA was documented in 6.1% of cases and was more common if the patient was female (p = 0.03) and less than 65 years of age (p = 0.04). Patients without clinical evidence of coronary artery disease had a 0.8% mortality rate from cardiac disease compared with 6.2% if any stigmata of coronary disease were present. Prior aortocoronary bypass surgery did not reduce the incidence of postoperative cardiac events or operative mortality rate. Patients having ""routine"" angiography did not have a less complicated operative course, fewer thrombotic complications, or lower mortality rate than those not having it. Those patients with an inflammatory AAA (4.5%) did not have a significantly higher incidence of pain. Heparin administration (84.8%) did not reduce the complications of graft thrombosis, ""trash,"" distal thrombosis, and/or amputation. The 6.8% of patients requiring suprarenal aortic cross-clamping had a higher incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction (p = 0.02) and intraoperative blood loss (p less than 0.001), but cardiac events were not more frequent. When the aortic cross-clamping time was prolonged (more than 70 minutes), the requirement for crystalloid fluid administration increased (p less than 0.001) and postoperative myocardial infarction was more common (p = 0.004). After ligation of the left renal vein in 7.9%, renal damage or dialysis was more frequent (p = 0.01). Patients having an intra-abdominal graft (tube, 38.5% and biiliac, 30.7%) had fewer wound infections (p = 0.02) and graft thromboses (p less than 0.001) than the patients with a femoral anastomosis. When the internal iliac artery flow was interrupted bilaterally (12%), diarrhea (p = 0.03) and ischemic colitis (p = 0.03) were more frequent complications. Reimplantation of the inferior mesenteric artery was carried out in 4.8%. After renal artery bypass in 2.1%, the mortality rate was not increased, but the incidence of transient renal dysfunction was increased (p = 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD008691,0,15481627,0,Comparison of cardiac troponin T and troponin I assays--implications of analytical and biochemical differences on clinical performance.,"The usefulness of cardiac troponins for detection of myocardial cell necrosis and risk stratification has been established beyond doubt. Cardiac troponin testing is a key diagnostic element for the diagnosis and management of patients with acute coronary syndromes without ST segment elevation and is increasingly used in non-coronary diseases to indicate prognostically important cardiac damage. Given the biochemical and analytical differences of cTnT and cTnI there is ongoing controversy regarding the comparability and clinical performance of cTnT and cTnI. cTnT and cTnI are both expressed in cardiomyocytes but differ with respect to biochemical and analytical characteristics. While minor differences of analytical precision or biochemical properties are not relevant for diagnosis and management of patients with acute coronary syndromes and most diseases with non-coronary related elevations of cardiac troponins, these differences may be amplified in patients with chronic renal failure. In fact, recent studies in patients with end-stage renal disease under chronic hemodialysis have readdressed the issue whether cTnT and cTnI are really comparable. The present review will provide a state-of-the-art overview on the performance of cardiac troponins in acute coronary disease and other clinical conditions."

CD008691,0,19410683,0,Clinical insights from the Treating to New Targets trial.,"The Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial enrolled 10,001 patients with coronary disease to treatment with atorvastatin, 80 or 10 mg/d, and observed them for a median of 4.9 years. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were 77 mg/dL in the 80-mg group and 101 mg/dL in the 10-mg group. The primary end point, a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infraction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and stroke, occurred in 10.9% of patients in the 10-mg and 8.7% of patients in the 80-mg group (P = .0002). In large subgroups of patients in TNT, specifically those with diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, or previous coronary bypass (CABG) surgery, the risk of an event was significantly higher than in patients without these features. The absolute risk reduction in the 80-mg group was greater in each of these subgroups than in other TNT patients. The rates of stroke and hospitalization for heart failure were significantly lower in the more aggressively treated patients. A total of 18,696 patients have taken 80 mg of atorvastatin in clinical trials, usually for 4 to 5 years, with an excellent safety record. Pharmacoeconomic studies indicate that treatment with the 80-mg dose instead of the 10-mg dose almost costs neutral in US TNT-like patients (additional cost $181 for 5 years). In summary, wider use of the 80-mg dose of atorvastatin in patients with stable coronary disease is safe, cost-effective, and provides an incremental reduction in coronary events."

CD008691,0,1260553,0,Intra-aortic balloon pump assist: adjunct to surgery for left ventricular dysfunction.,"Intra-aortic balloon pump assist (IABPA) was used intraoperatively and postoperatively in 34 patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction: the mean ejection fraction was 0.29 and all patients had angiographic grade IV left ventricular contractility. There were three groups of patients: 11 patients with acute coronary artery insufficiency--10 of whom survived vein bypass surgery (group 1); 16 patients with crescendo-type unstable angina--of whom 15 survived surgery (group 2); 7 patients with single (6) or multivalvular (1) replacement (combined with vein bypass in 3)--of whom 5 survived (group 3). Overall survival was 88%. The mean duration of 1:1 IABPA was 40 hours. Inotropic support was not required, hemolysis was insignificant and hemostasis remained secure. Two patients required tracheostomy and one required dialysis. One patient had a peripheral embolus in the leg used for IABPA. IABPA improves subendocardial perfusion during induction of anesthesia, during cardiopulmonary bypass and into the postoperative period; left ventricular work is decreased with a concomitant increase in coronary artery and vein graft blood flow. Use of IABPA may also improve survival and lessen morbidity in patients with left ventricular dysfunction due to the beneficial effects on myocardial performance and is thus a valuable adjunct to cardiac surgery in high-risk patients."

In fact, during induced hypocalcaemia, the predominant mechanism that causes PTH to be released is the reduction of plasma Ca(2+) irrespective of the absolute starting concentration of ionized calcium. This mechanism, which is rate-dependent and even activated in conditions of hypercalcaemia, may be involved in the association, reported in several papers, between the basal Ca(2+) and the set point of the calcium-PTH curve."

Its electrophysiological characteristics for antiarrhythmic efficacy are largely unknown; thus, this study aims to explore the resveratrol's antiarrhythmic effects and conduction system in isolated hearts as well as its electrophysiological effects on cardiac myocytes. In the experiment, resveratrol suppressed the ischemia/reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts. In the current clamp study of the experiment, resveratrol prolonged the action potential duration (APD(50) and APD(90)) and suppressed the upstroke velocity of the action potential (V(max)). In the voltage clamp study, resveratrol inhibited sodium inward current (I(Na)) in a concentration-dependent manner and negative-shifted the voltage-dependent inactivation curve. Resveratrol also reduced the calcium inward current (I(Ca), 51.2+/-13.3% at 100 microM). Furthermore, the transient (I(to)) and sustained (I(ss)) outward potassium currents were decreased 60.2+/-5.7% and 42.3+/-5.2% after exposure to resveratrol (100 microM), respectively. The inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1)) was also reduced 24.2+/-7.0% in the presence of resveratrol (100 microM). In the isolated heart perfusion model, resveratrol (100 microM) prolonged AV nodal refractory period, the Wenckebach cycle length and the conduction through AV node and His-Purkinje system. In conclusion, resveratrol increased the cardiac effective refractory period mainly through inhibiting the ionic channels including I(Na), I(to) and I(ss) which could contribute to the conversion of ischemia/reperfusion-induced lethal arrhythmias."

The association of several risk factors with CHD incidence was studied among participants with CKD in the population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. CHD risk factors and estimated GFR using serum creatinine were measured among 807 ARIC participants with CKD (estimated GFR between 15 and 59 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). The incidence of CHD during 10.5 yr of follow-up was 6.3, 8.5, and 14.4 per 1000 person-years among ARIC participants with an estimated GFR of >/=90, 60 to 89, and 15 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), respectively. After adjustment for age, race, gender, and ARIC field center, among those with CKD, the relative risk (95% confidence interval) of CHD was 1.65 (1.01 to 2.67) for current smoking, 2.02 (1.27 to 3.22) for hypertension, 3.06 (2.01 to 4.67) for diabetes, and 1.96 (1.14 to 3.36) for anemia. The comparably adjusted relative risks of CHD for each standard deviation higher total and HDL cholesterol were 1.50 (1.25 to 1.71) and 0.79 (0.62 to 1.01), respectively, and 1.38 (1.13 to 1.69), 1.24 (1.06 to 1.46), 0.65 (0.54 to 0.79), and 1.38 (1.19 to 1.59) for waist circumference, leukocyte count, serum albumin, and fibrinogen, respectively.

Over a 4-year period, we performed coronary stenting on 40 lesions in 34 patients with ESRD. We compared these lesions with 80 lesions from patients without renal disease who underwent coronary stenting in the STARS and WINS clinical trials, matched for treatment site, diabetes, lesion length, and reference vessel diameter. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed on all lesions and clinical outcomes were assessed at 9-month follow-up. Clinical and angiographic characteristics were well matched between the 2 groups and acute clinical success rates were similar. Despite comparable initial angiographic results over the 9-month follow-up period, repeat target lesion revascularization was twice as frequent in the ESRD group compared with the control group (35% vs 16%, p <0.05). After adjusting for differences in postprocedural minimum lumen diameter and other angiographic and clinical characteristics, ESRD remained the most important predictor of late target lesion revascularization (relative risk = 2.3, p = 0.04). In addition, overall 9-month mortality was higher for ESRD patients than for the control population (18% vs 2%, p <0.01). Thus, despite similar angiographic results, patients with ESRD are at higher risk for target lesion revascularization after coronary stenting than controls. Nonetheless, most patients with ESRD do not develop restenosis after stent placement, suggesting an important role for stenting in the management of this challenging population."

On the other hand, the use of stents in this population had not previously been assessed. This retrospective study compared 63 coronary patients on haemodialysis with a référence group of 63 paired patients with respect to gender, age, and the necessity or not of stent implantation. There was a higher frequency of hypertension (79 vs 39%) and of hypertriglyceridaema (22 vs 8%) in the haemodialysis group than in the controls. However, there was no significant difference with respect to primary success rate of angioplasty (92 and 89% respectively), nor to the development of early cardiovascular complications (4% and 1.9% respectively). After a two-year follow-up, there was no significant difference in the restenosis rate in the haemodialysis patients (33%) compared with the controls (25%). Nevertheless, the mortality rate at 2 years was higher in the dialysis group (15%) compared with the reference group (3.5%, p = 0.03). However, this mortality rate was lower than that reported in the literature in haemodialysis patients after balloon angioplasty. Therefore, haemodialysis does not increase the risk of restenosis when an optimal angiographic results is obtained either by balloon angioplasty or by angioplasty with stenting. Coronary angioplasty is a safe and effective method of revascularisation in coronary haemodialysis patients when the lesions are accessible to stenting."

CD008691,0,17877923,0,Arterial stiffness as a risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis.,"The major pathophysiologic process of coronary atherosclerosis is a defect or injury of the arterial endothelial function. The rate of progression of coronary atherosclerosis is highly variable and mainly determined by risk contributors such as lipids, glucose, and smoking. Coronary plaque rupture is the precipitating factor for clot formation and acute coronary events. Measurement of arterial stiffness with different noninvasive techniques provides information about the functional and structural vascular changes at the level of the aorta, muscular conduit arteries, the peripheral branches, and the microvascular components. Arterial stiffness has been related to the Framingham and other cardiovascular risk scores. Large artery stiffness contributes to exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease. It can predict the outcome after coronary interventions. There is now evidence that arterial stiffness is a predictor for cardiovascular events in the general population, in patients with hypertension, end-stage renal disease, impaired glucose intolerance, and coronary artery disease. Future studies are warranted to demonstrate the value of follow-up of arterial stiffness as a marker of reduction of arterial wall damage during antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and lipid-lowering therapy. Promising study results show that measurement of arterial stiffness could become an important part of the routine assessment of patients in daily practice."

CD008691,0,19048834,0,[Renal dysfunction and mitral regurgitation in patients with chronic heart failure].,"The objective of this study was to elucidate the relationship between mitral regurgitation (MR) and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). A total of 340 patients with CHF (200 men and 140 women, mean age 58.0 +/- 12.9 years) were included in the study. Arterial hypertension (AH) was the cause of CHF in 44 (13%) patients, coronary heart disease in 112 (33%) patients, and combination of the two disorders in 184 (54%) patients. CHF of functional classes I and II was diagnosed in 112 (33%) and 177 (53%) patients respectively, CHF of functional classes III and IV in 34 (10%) and 17 (5%) patients. GFR was calculated using the MDRD formula. The left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was 56.9 +/- 10.5%. Systolic dysfunction occurred in 90 (26%) patients and mitral regurgitation in 221 (65%). GFR varied from 19.2 to 149.7 (mean 68.8 +/- 2.9) ml/min/1.73 m2. CRF was below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 in 114 (34%) patients. There was significant positive correlation between the occurrence of MR and the functional class of CHF (r = 0.35; p < 0.001) while GFR was inversely related to MR (r = -0.43; p < 0.001). Multifactor regression analysis demonstrated that manifestation of MR was associated with the decreased functional activity of the kidneys regardless of the patients"" age. It is concluded that changes in the structure of the echo signal from the mitral valve in patients with CHF due to coronary heart disease and/or arterial hypertension are most common in patients with GFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. The degree of MR manifestation is closely associated with the impaired functional activity of the kidneys."

Kidney and kidney-pancreas transplant candidates with diabetes for more than 10 years and/or retinopathy and/or biopsy verified diabetic nephropathy were included. The inclusion period was 1999-2004. Seventy-two percent of patients were male. Sixty-one percent had type 1 diabetes and 39% had type 2 diabetes and mean age was 46 years (+/-10) and 58 years (+/-11), respectively. History of heart disease was present in 34% of patients, 34% had cerebro-vascular and/or peripheral atherosclerotic disease, and 51% had neither. Fifty-five percent had a smoking history and 46% were on dialysis. Significant CAS was found in 45% of patients, of whom 17% had AP. No patients below 35 years of age had significant CAS (n = 11, p = 0.001). Revascularization was performed in 57% of patients with significant CAS. The only risk factor for significant CAS in multiple logistic regression was age (p = 0.046). Approximately half of the patients had significant CAS, and half of these underwent revascularization. Most patients with CAS did not have symptoms of myocardial ischemia. The data justify screening diabetic nephropathy transplant candidates with coronary angiography before transplantation."

CD008691,0,18235089,0,Association of mild to moderate kidney dysfunction and coronary calcification.,"Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is prevalent and predicts mortality among patients with ESRD, but whether less severe kidney dysfunction is associated with CAC is uncertain. To address this question, 6749 participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, who were middle-aged and without known cardiovascular disease, were evaluated. Renal function was categorized by cystatin C quartiles and estimated GFR (eGFR; < to >60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), and CAC was evaluated by computed tomography (CT). Fifty percent of participants had CAC, mean cystatin C was 0.90 mg/L, and 10% had eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). In unadjusted analysis, kidney dysfunction by either measure was strongly associated with CAC; however, the associations were lost after adjustment for age, gender, race, hypertension, and IL-6 (relative risk 1.04 [95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.11] for the highest cystatin C quartile compared with the lowest, and relative risk 1.03 [95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.08] for eGFR below compared with above 60 m/min per 1.73 m(2)). Similarly, neither higher cystatin C nor eGFR <60 was associated with severity of CAC. These results suggest that a higher burden of CAC is unlikely to explain the association between mild to moderate kidney dysfunction and cardiovascular mortality."
CD008691,0,15848702,1,Incidence of coronary heart disease and cardiac events in patients undergoing kidney and pancreatic transplantation.,"One major cause of graft loss after kidney transplantation or simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplantation is death of the recipient due to cardiac events. Records of 261 patients who underwent sole kidney (group A) or combined kidney-pancreas transplantation (group B) were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into groups with basic cardiac evaluation (chest X-ray, electrocardiogram) and patients with additional diagnostics [echocardiography, exercise stress test, myocardial perfusion test, and coronary angiography (CAG)]. The results of the performed CAGs were as follows: proven coronary artery disease (CAD) in 22 patients (12.43%) in group A and 37 patients (44.05%) in group B; stenosis of one main coronary artery of 70% or greater in 8.47% (group A) and 16.67% (group B) of the patients. Subsequent revascularization procedures were performed in 15 candidates (8.47%) of group A and 11 (13.10%) of group B. The incidence of posttransplant cardiac events (PCE) was lower in recipients in both groups who underwent additional cardiac evaluation. Late postoperative deaths were reported in 3.45% of kidney recipients with no additional evaluation (group A), in 2.06% of patients with further diagnostics (group A), and in only 1.19% of patients with invasive pretransplant evaluation (group B). Patients with known CAD and no further invasive diagnostics or subsequent revascularization are at great risk. PCE were observed in three of seven patients in this subgroup. Careful cardiac evaluation including echocardiography, exercise stress test, myocardial perfusion test, and CAG is associated with a low incidence of PCE."

The data supporting various prophylactic measures and adjunctive therapies to prevent this complication are conflicting. However, contrast volume is clearly related to CIN after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and the risk of CIN has been shown to be directly related to contrast dose. Therefore, minimizing contrast exposure is a primary method to reduce the risk of CIN, especially in at-risk patients. We report a novel technique designed to deliver ultra-low (<15 cm(3)) volume contrast to patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing coronary angiography and PCI."
CD008691,0,16097367,0,Predictors of undiagnosed renal artery stenosis among Japanese patients with risk factors of atherosclerosis.,"Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is a significant cause of end stage renal dysfunction (ESRD) among the elderly. Although early detection of ARAS and induction of adequate treatment could reduce the incidence of ESRD, there have been few reports about parameters predictive of ARAS among Japanese. In this study, we investigated the clinical indicators that predict ARAS among Japanese with risk factors of atherosclerosis (> 40 years of age plus hypertension, dyslipidemia or diabetes mellitus). After eliminating the patients who had already been diagnosed with renal artery stenosis, 202 patients were enrolled. The renal arteries of all 202 patients were evaluated by magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA), and the stenoses with > 50% reduction in diameter at the ostium of the renal artery were defined as ARAS. MRA detected ARAS in 42 patients (31 hemilateral and 11 bilateral). Between the patients with and without ARAS there was no significant difference in gender distribution, detection of abdominal vascular bruits or smoking habit. The prevalences of diabetic, hypertensive and cerebrovascular comorbidity were also not significantly different. The mean blood pressure, body mass index and total serum cholesterol values were similar between the two groups. However, age, pulse pressure, serum uric acid, serum creatinine, amount of urinary protein, and coronary artery comorbidity were significantly higher, while estimated creatinine clearance was significantly lower in the patients with ARAS than in those without ARAS. A high prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy was also noted among patients with ARAS. Multivariate analysis revealed that older age and renal impairment were independent predictors of ARAS in Japanese patients with atherosclerotic risk factors."
CD008691,0,17719319,0,Predictors of in-stent restenosis and patient outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetics have a significantly higher incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and in-stent restenosis (ISR) than nondiabetics after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Predictors of MACEs and ISR are uncertain in diabetics. In recent studies, microalbuminuria and proliferative retinopathy have been believed to relate to progressive coronary atherosclerosis. We retrospectively studied 191 consecutive patients (mean age 65 +/- 9 years) with diabetes who underwent PCI to determine predictors of ISR and MACEs (defined as cumulative incidence of myocardial infarction, revascularization, or death from cardiovascular cause), with special reference to microalbuminuria and proliferative retinopathy. Of 191 patients, 106 (56%) had a follow-up coronary angiogram at 16 +/- 2 months. Of these 106 patients, 66 (62%) developed ISR. In the multivariate model, microalbuminuria or proliferative retinopathy did not achieve significant association with ISR. Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly associated with a lower incidence of ISR (odds ratio [OR] 0.928, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.876 to 0.983, p = 0.011) and MACEs (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.931 to 1.000, p = 0.048). Use of drug-eluting stents also had a negative association with ISR (OR 0.171, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.585, p = 0.004). Renal insufficiency was associated with higher MACEs (OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.45 to 7.031, p = 0.0039). In conclusion, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were inversely associated with ISR or MACEs."

CD008691,0,11885754,0,The E4 allele of apolipoprotein E is associated with increased restenosis after coronary angioplasty.,"The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of the E4 allele of apolipoprotein E (apo E) on restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The subjects were 171 male patients with more than 75% luminal diameter stenotic lesions of the coronary artery who had undergone an elective initial PTCA. The PTCA was successful in 164 patients, 157 of whom completed a prospective 5 month coronary angiography (CAG) follow up to assess the degree of restenosis after their surgery. Patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG), 3 vessel disease, complete obstruction or calcified lesions of the coronary artery, cerebro-vascular disease (CVD), arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO), and renal failure with hemodialysis were excluded, leaving 105 patients in the analysis. Subjects carrying the E4 allele (n = 22, Phenotype E4/2 = 2, E4/3 = 19, E4/4 = 1: E4 group) were well matched with non-carriers (n = 83, Phenotype E2/2 = 0, E3/2 = 4, E3/3 = 79: E3 group) for clinical, and pre-and post-PTCA angiographic features. The restenosis rates were significantly higher in the E4 group than in the E3 group (patient restenosis rate : 59.1 vs 33.7% p < 0.05, lesion restenosis rate: 51.8 vs 30.9% p < 0.05). These results suggest that the E4 allele is associated with a higher restenosis rate after PTCA."

Lipid data from two large controlled studies of 1295 renal transplant patients were analyzed retrospectively. Sirolimus 2 mg/day and 5 mg/day were compared with placebo or azathioprine, and administered concomitantly with steroids and cyclosporine over 12 months. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia occurred in all treatment groups and were maximal at 2-3 months. The sirolimus groups evidenced higher lipid levels than the controls, but the elevations diminished over time. At 1 year, the patients given sirolimus 2 mg/day had a mean cholesterol level 17 mg/dL greater and a mean triglyceride level 59 mg/dL greater than the controls. Among the patients given sirolimus 5 mg/day, mean cholesterol was 30 mg/dL greater and mean triglycerides were 103 mg/dL greater than the controls. Treatment with statins and fibrates was effective in reducing cholesterol and triglyceride levels, respectively, in the sirolimus-treated patients. The Framingham risk model predicted that the 17 mg/dL elevation in cholesterol would increase the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) by 1.5 new cases per 1000 persons per year and CHD death by 0.7 events per 1000 persons per year. Lipid elevations observed in the sirolimus-treated patients were manageable, improved over time, and responded to lipid-lowering therapy. Based on the Framingham risk model, the CHD risks associated with these cholesterol elevations are small compared with the baseline risks of the transplant population."

CD008691,0,17374087,0,Cardiovascular calcification in nondialyzed patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a major health-care problem of global proportions. Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the need for renal replacement therapy, and the high annual death rate of dialysis patients are the most noticeable outcomes of CKD. Less appreciated, however, is the fact that most patients with CKD actually die mainly from cardiovascular disease, rather than progress to ESRD. Coronary artery calcification (CAC), a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis, is common in dialysis and CKD patients. Coronary artery calcium scores, as measured by ultrafast computed tomography, is an independent predictor of future cardiac events. Using this technique, several studies have documented extensive calcification in dialysis patients, a subject of several exhaustive reviews. Unfortunately, much less attention has been paid to calcification in nondialyzed patients with CKD. In this review, I will emphasize the fact that CVC is common in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis, develops early in the course of CKD, and worsens with the decline in renal function particularly among diabetics who progressed to ESRD. I will also discuss the pathogenesis of CVC in CKD patients and highlight the lack of a major role for abnormalities of mineral metabolism in the pathogenesis of calcification in CKD patients. In addition to the high prevalence of traditional risk factors for CAD, the presence of proteinuria, reduced renal function, diabetic nephropathy, and the rate of progression to ESRD may represent the main uremia-related factors that increase the risk for calcification in CKD. Finally, I will review the protective role of inhibitors of calcification in CKD."

Such patients frequently develop complications such as asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). Accordingly, CAD must ideally be diagnosed at an early stage to improve prognosis. Although myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is valuable for diagnosing CAD, the stress test is not always applicable to patients on hemodialysis.

CD008691,0,11909572,1,Validation of an algorithm for predicting cardiac events in renal transplant candidates.,"A 2-tiered noninvasive cardiac risk stratification algorithm was first evaluated in a test population with planar thallium myocardial perfusion imaging and subsequently in a validation population using single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) thallium myocardial perfusion imaging. This study examines if SPECT imaging was as predictive of cardiac death as planar imaging and also if SPECT imaging predicted nonfatal cardiac events in the patient population. Renal transplant candidates were evaluated using a 2-tiered noninvasive cardiac risk stratification algorithm. The first tier of risk assessment utilized 5 variables: age >50 years, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, abnormal electrocardiogram, and a history of either angina or congestive heart failure. Patients without risk factors were considered low risk and underwent no further cardiac evaluation. Patients with > or =1 risk factor were considered high risk and underwent a second tier of risk assessment with planar (n = 95) or SPECT (n = 112) imaging. In the test population, 13 of 16 cardiac deaths (81%) occurred in high-risk patients with abnormal planar studies. In the validation group, all cardiac deaths (5 of 60) and nonfatal cardiac events (13 of 60) occurred in high-risk patients with abnormal SPECT studies. SPECT imaging was at least as predictive as planar imaging and also predicted nonfatal as well as fatal cardiac events. Pretransplant risk stratification by clinical variables identified low-risk patients who may not require further cardiac evaluation and high-risk patients with normal SPECT imaging who may not require angiography."

Metallic, coiled stents were successfully deployed in 95/96 (99%) patients within 100/101 (99%) SVGs. The indications for deployment were threatened [81 patients (84%)] or acute [15 patients (16%)] vein graft closure following PTCA. Intragraft urokinase infusion was performed in 17 patients (17%) [6 patients with baseline occlusions; 11 with abrupt closure post PTCA]. Complications encountered included three (3%) in-hospital deaths (two procedure related) two (2%) Q wave myocardial infarctions, six (6%) non-Q wave myocardial infarctions, and 22 (22%) bleeding problems. These included, not mutually exclusively, 21 (22%) requiring transfusions, six (6%) cases of gastrointestinal bleeding, six (6%) pseudoaneurysms, five (5%) retroperitoneal haemorrhages and two (2%) cerebrovascular accidents. All patients received dipyridamole, aspirin, dextran, and anticoagulation (heparin 10-20,000 U intra-procedurally); a heparin infusion was continued for 5 +/- 1 days, despite warfarin administration which attained a therapeutic prothrombin time (PT) (1.5-2 times control) by 3 +/- 1 days. Out of the 95 successfully treated patients, six with eight stented grafts were ineligible for pre-discharge angiography.

CD008691,0,9520130,0,LDL-unbound apolipoprotein(a) and carotid atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients.,"High lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] plasma concentrations, which are genetically determined by apo(a) size polymorphism, are directly associated with an increased risk for atherosclerosis. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who show an enormous prevalence of cardiovascular disease, have elevated plasma concentrations of Lp(a). In recent studies we were able to show that apo(a) size polymorphism is a better predictor for carotid atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease in hemodialysis patients than concentrations of Lp(a) and other lipoproteins. Less than 5% of apo(a) in plasma exists in a low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-unbound form. This ""free"" apo(a) consists mainly of disintegrated apo(a) molecules of different molecular weight, ranging from about 125 to 360 kDa. LDL-unbound apo(a) molecules are elevated in patients with ESRD. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate whether the LDL-unbound form of apo(a) contributes to the prediction of carotid atherosclerosis in a group of 153 hemodialysis patients. The absolute amount of LDL-unbound apo(a) showed a trend to increasing values with the degree of carotid atherosclerosis, but the correlation of Lp(a) plasma concentrations with atherosclerosis was more pronounced. In multivariate analysis the two variables were related to neither the presence nor the degree of atherosclerosis. Instead, the apo(a) phenotype took the place of Lp(a) and LDL-unbound apo(a). After adjustment for other variables, the odds ratio for carotid atherosclerosis in patients with a low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype was about 5 (p<0.01). This indicates a strong association between the apo(a) phenotype and the prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis. Finally, multivariate regression analysis revealed age, angina pectoris and the apo(a) phenotype as the only significant predictors of the degree of atherosclerosis in these patients. In summary, it seems that LDL-unbound apo(a) levels do not contribute to the prediction of carotid atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. However, this does not mean that ""free"", mainly disintegrated, apo(a) has no atherogenic potential."

The study design included risk factor analysis and determination of serum homocysteine in hemodialysis patients. Fifty chronic uremic patients on regular hemodialysis treatment were studied. Twenty-four patients had coronary, cerebral, or peripheral signs of occlusive vascular disease. Cerebral vascular disease was diagnosed by computed tomography, arterial angiography, or Doppler sonography of the carotid and vertebral arteries. Coronary vascular disease was diagnosed by documented history of myocardial infarction or by coronary angiography. The diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease was established by angiography of the lower limb arteries. In all control patients, Doppler sonography of the carotid, vertebral, and lower limb arteries and thallium-201 exercise imaging were without pathologic results. Measurements included blood pressure, body mass index, smoking behavior, serum homocysteine (measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), serum total, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein (a), triglycerides, and plasma fibrinogen. In a stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, high serum homocysteine was significantly associated with occlusive arterial disease (R = 0.23; P = 0.031). Furthermore, hypertension (R = 0.18; P = 0.058), but not serum total, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein (a), triglycerides, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, plasma fibrinogen, and smoking behavior, was significantly associated with atherosclerosis. Our results support the hypothesis that hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for vascular disease in hemodialysis patients."

CD008691,0,8300457,0,Left ventricular diastolic function--pulsed Doppler echocardiography versus radionuclide angiography.,"Fifty five consecutive patients diagnosed to have coronary artery disease by coronary angiography had their left ventricular (LV) diastolic functions evaluated by pulsed doppler (PD) methods and radionuclide angiography (RNA). Using PD, the peak velocities of the early filling wave 'E' and the late filling wave 'A' of mitral inflow were measured. LV diastolic dysfunction, defined as E/A ratio less than 1.0, was present in 31 of 38 patients with low RNA peak filling rates (PFR) of 2.3 EDV/sec or less (sensitivity 81.6%). Normal E/A ratios (> 1.0) were seen in 13 of 17 patients with normal RNA PFR of > 2.3 EDV/sec (specificity 76.5%). Both methods were in agreement in 44 of 55 patients (accuracy 80%). There was good direct correlation between RNA PFR and PD E/A ratio (correlation coefficient r = 0.51, P < 0.01). It is concluded that PD echocardiography is a simple and reliable method of identifying diastolic dysfunction in patients with ischaemic heart disease."

A 66-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for further examination of dyspnea on effort. He has been performed maintenance hemodialysis since 1999 for chronic renal failure. Coronary angiography and multislice spiral computed tomography (CT) revealed an unusual coronary anatomic variance in which separate origins of the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) coronary arteries arose from the left coronary aortic sinus. Furthermore, these images of the LCx revealed an aneurysm 2 cm in diameter and 99% stenosis at the proximal of side of the aneurysm.

CD008691,0,18678302,0,Indexes of kidney function and coronary artery and abdominal aortic calcium (from the Framingham Offspring Study).,"It is uncertain whether moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) or measures of kidney function are associated with subclinical atherosclerosis as represented by coronary artery calcium (CAC) or abdominal aortic calcium (AAC). We used logistic and linear regression analyses to relate CKD (glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), cystatin C (cysC), and microalbuminuria (MA) with CAC and AAC obtained using multidetector computed tomography in Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants (mean age 59 years, 55.3% women). Increased CAC and AAC were defined as > or =90th percentile age- and gender-specific cutpoints based on a healthy referent sample. Major cardiovascular disease risk factors were accounted for in multivariable models. Of 1,179 participants, 1,174 had AAC measurements and 1,147 had CAC measurements, 6.3% had CKD, and 8.3% had MA. CKD was not associated with CAC (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio [OR] for CKD 1.18, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 2.36, p = 0.63) or AAC (multivariable-adjusted OR for CKD 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 2.04, p = 0.73). CysC was associated with CAC in age- and gender-adjusted but not in multivariable models (age- and gender-adjusted OR for log cysC per SD increment and CAC 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.41, p = 0.04; multivariable-adjusted OR 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.38, p = 0.15). MA was not associated with CAC (OR 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 1.61, p = 0.54). Neither cysC nor MA was significantly associated with AAC in age- and gender- or multivariable-adjusted models. In conclusion, CKD, cysC, and MA are not associated with CAC or AAC when accounting for cardiovascular disease risk factors."
CD008691,0,7579050,0,The prognostic importance of left ventricular geometry in uremic cardiomyopathy.,"The objective of this study was to determine the effect of left ventricular (LV) mass, volume, and mass-to-volume ratio on mortality in chronic dialysis patients. The Design was a multicenter, prospective inception cohort study with a median follow-up of 41 months. The Setting was three university-affiliated nephrology units. A total of 433 patients who (1) survived > 6 months from the start of ESRD therapy and (2) had a technically satisfactory baseline echocardiogram were studied. Measurements included a baseline clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic assessment. LV hypertrophy was present in 74% and LV dilation was present in 36% of patients. In patients with normal cavity volume (< or = 90 mL/m2) and normal systolic function, high LV mass index (> 120 g/m2) and mass-to-volume ratios (> 2.2 g/mL) were independently associated with late mortality (> 2 yr after starting dialysis therapy). After adjusting for baseline age, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease, the relative risk for the former was 3.29 and for the latter was 2.24. Cavity volume was of no prognostic significance in this group. In patients with LV dilation and normal systolic function, high cavity volume (> 120 mL/m2) and low mass-to-volume ratio (< 1.8 mL/m2) were independently associated with late mortality, the relative risk in the former being 17.14 and the latter being 4.27. LV mass index was of no prognostic significance in this group. The baseline echocardiographic classification, based on LV mass and cavity volume, was the strongest predictor of late mortality, after adjusting for age, gender, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, chronic hypertension, and hemoglobin and serum albumin levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008691,0,15365517,0,Relationship of proximal fixation to renal dysfunction in patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair.,"Technological advancements have lead to dramatic improvements in stentgraft device design resulting in more trackable delivery systems and transrenal uncovered stents and barbs for better fixation. Transrenal bare-stents may limit stentgraft migration, particularly in patients with short or flared proximal aortic necks. However, potential disadvantages might be in worsening renal function, particularly in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency. We retrospectively analyzed our recent 7 year experience of patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) using a variety of stentgrafts with and without transrenal bare-stent fixation. Patients were divided into 2 groups; infrarenal fixation (IRF) vs transrenal fixation (TRF), or patients with preoperative serum Cr values that were normal (= or <1.5 mg/dl) vs slightly elevated (1.6-2 mg/dl), vs markedly elevated (2.1- 3.5 mg/dl). The exclusion criteria included patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) on hemodialysis, and preoperative high-grade renal artery stenoses requiring angioplasty and stenting. Of 705 patients that underwent EVAR, 496 (IRF: 385 [78%], and TRF: 111 [22%]) were available with routine evaluations of serum Cr and CT scans. Preexisting comorbidities, mean procedure contrast volume, and postprocedure follow-up were similar in both groups. In the immediate postoperative period, mean serum Cr did not change significantly in either the IRF group (1.3+/-0.7 mg/dl to 1.2+/-0.9 mg/dl) or the TRF group (1.3+/-0.5 mg/dl to 1.3+/-0.6 mg/dl). Mean serum Cr did, however, significantly increase over longer follow-up in both groups: 1.4+/-0.8 mg/dl for IRF (P<0.03), and 1.5 +/- 0.8 mg/dl for TRF (P<0.01). Cr clearance was similarly unchanged in the immediate postoperative period (58+/-23 to 61+/-25 ml/min/1.73 m2 for IRF group, 53+/-17 to 55+/-17 ml/min/1.73 m2 for TRF group), but was significantly decreased in longer follow-up (53+/-23 ml/min/1.73 m2 for IRF, p<0.02: and 48+/-16 ml/min/1.73 m2 for TRF, P<0.01). There were no significant differences in serum Cr increase (p=0.19) or Cr clearance decrease (p=0.68) between the IRF and TRF groups. Small renal infarcts were noted in 6 patients (1.6%) in the IRF group, and in 8 patients (7%) in the TRF group (p=0.37). Of patients with normal preoperative renal function, renal dysfunction developed in 7.7% of IRF group and 6.1% of TRF group (p=0.76). In patients with preexisting CRI, renal dysfunction developed in 18.2% of IRF group, and 17.1% of TRF group (p=0.95). Eight patients with postoperative renal dysfunction, 5 (1.3%) from IRF group and 3 (2.7%) from TRF group subsequently required hemodialysis, and this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.91). We also analyzed 200 consecutive patients undergoing EVAR with intra-arterial contrast agents with and without preexisting CRI not on dialysis. The groups were identified on the basis of preprocedure serum Cr: group 1 (n=108), Cr less than 1.5 mg/dL (normal range); group 2 (n=65), Cr 1.5 to 2.0 mg/dL; group 3 (n=27), Cr 2.1 to 3.5 mg/dL. Routine precautions in patients with CRI included preoperative intravenous hydration with 2 L of normal saline solution, discontinuation of all nephrotoxic drugs, intraoperative administration of mannitol (0.5 g/kg intravenously), and use of nonionic, low osmolar intra-arterial contrast agent (Omnipaque 350). One-hundred and eight patients had normal renal function (group 1), and 92 patients had preexisting CRI with baseline Cr 1.5 to 2.0 mg/dL (group 2, n=65) or 2.1 to 3.5 mg/dL (group 3, n=27). Comorbid conditions included coronary artery disease (group 1, 51%; group 2, 49%; group 3, 59%), hypertension (group 1, 39%; group 2, 46%; group 3, 52%), and diabetes mellitus (group 1, 25%; group 2, 35%; group 3, 48%). In groups 1, 2, and 3, the mean volume of low osmolar contrast agent used was 210 cc, 160 cc, 130 cc, respectively; hemodynamic instability developed in 3, 1, and 1 patient, respectively. The incidence of postoperative complications between the 3 study groups was not statistically different. In grications between the 3 study groups was not statistically different. In group 1 a transient increase in serum Cr (>30% over baseline and >1.4 mg/dL) was noted in 3 patients (2.7%), 2 of whom (1.9%) required temporary hemodialysis and 1 (0.9%) who died of renal failure. In group 2 a transient increase in serum Cr was noted in 2 patients (3.1%); both patients (3.1%) required temporary hemodialysis, and 1 patient (1.5%) died of renal failure. In group 3 a transient increase in serum Cr was noted in 2 patients (7.4%); 1 patient (3.7%) required temporary hemodialysis, and 1 patient (3.7%) died of renal failure. Perioperative hypotension significantly increased the risk for elevated serum Cr and death (p<0.05), and larger contrast volume was associated with an increase in serum Cr (p<0.05) during the postoperative period. Following EVAR renal function declines slightly with both IRF and TRF. Our data show no overall difference between patients with IRF and TRF with respect to infarcts, decline in renal function, or onset of dialysis. There were a slightly greater number of renal infarcts in the TRF group, but these infarcts were clinically inconsequential. In patients with CRI, EVAR with intra-arterial radiographic contrast agents is believed to impair renal function, and CRI is considered a relative contraindication to the procedure. Results of our investigation indicate that risk for worsening renal insufficiency, dialysis, and death is only slightly and not significantly greater in patients with CRI compared with patients with normal renal function. With appropriate precautions of avoiding perioperative hypotension and limiting the volume of nonionic contrast agents, CRI need not be a contraindication for EVAR with intra-arterial contrast agents."

CD008691,0,16609863,0,Cutting balloons for the treatment of vascular stenoses.,"The aim of this article is to review the mechanism, technical characteristics, biological response and clinical applications of cutting balloon angioplasty in peripheral vessels. The cutting balloon is a non-compliant, balloon catheter equipped with three-to-four microtome-sharp atherotomes. When used appropriately, it is safe and easy to use, with a high immediate success rate and few complications, provided oversizing is avoided. There is some evidence that pre-dilation with a standard or high-pressure balloon may also predispose to vascular rupture. The cutting balloon has proved to be beneficial in treating difficult complex lesions in the coronary arteries. Early experience in non-coronary vessels shows that cutting balloon angioplasty can be used to treat peripheral bypass anastomotic and haemodialysis fistula stenoses that are resistant to conventional high-inflation pressures. Its application in de novo peripheral arterial lesions and non-coronary in-stent restenosis is still under discussion. Theoretically, this device induces a smaller degree of vessel wall injury localised to the area of incisions and sparing the interincisional segments; however, this postulated reduction in restenosis rates has not been confirmed in clinical practice."

CD008691,0,18160761,0,Comparison of long-term clinical outcome after sirolimus-eluting stent implantation in patients with and without hemodialysis.,"Poor clinical outcomes for hemodialysis (HD) patients compared to non-HD patients after coronary intervention have been reported. Although coronary intervention using sirolimus-eluting stents (SESs) might be expected to reduce restenosis in HD patients, little is known about the efficacy of the SESs. The purpose of the present study was to compare the clinical and angiographic outcomes of HD patients with non-HD patients after SES implantation. The study population consisted of 170 consecutive patients (234 lesions) who had undergone successful coronary SES implantation. The patients were classified into 2 groups, an HD group (18 patients, 27 lesions) and a non-HD group (152 patients, 207 lesions). The incidence of any clinical event was significantly higher in the HD group than in the non-HD group (50.0% versus 12.5%, P < 0.0001). Target lesion revascularization was necessary in 6 patients (33.3%) in the HD group and in 7 patients (4.6%) in the non-HD group (P < 0.0001). The Cox proportional-hazards regression model on cardiac events identified HD patients (P = 0.0301, hazard ratio = 2.704) as an explanatory factor. Moreover, the Cox proportional-hazards regression model on target lesion revascularization identified HD (P = 0.0004, hazard ratio = 6.921) and in-stent re-stenosis lesion (P = 0.0293, hazard ratio = 3.323) as explanatory factors. The present study suggests that compared with non-HD patients, HD patients with coronary artery disease treated by SESs have a poorer clinical outcome."
CD008691,0,1621408,0,Short-term reproducibility of gas exchange measurements during bicycle exercise in patients with mild to moderate congestive heart failure.,"A series of 45 patients with congestive heart failure due to coronary disease had semisupine bicycle exercise tests (ramp protocol, 10 W/min) on two occasions separated by 3 to 7 days in order to determine the short-term reproducibility of gas exchange measurements during symptom-limited exercise. The percentage difference (PD) between each pair of measurements (m1, m2; PD = 100%.(m2-m1): m1) were calculated. The mean PD values (+/- 1 sigma) and the single determination standard deviations (SDSD) for exercise tolerance (ET, W), peak heart rate (pHR, 1/min), peak oxygen uptake (pVO2, ml/min/kg), peak carbon dioxide output (pVCO2, ml/min/kg), and peak minute ventilation (pVE, l/min) were as follows: [table: see text] No patient reached a plateau of oxygen uptake during the last portion of the ramp exercise test. Thus, pVO2 is not an objective endpoint. The single determination standard deviations show that exercise tolerance and peak oxygen uptake do not differ as to their reproducibility. The absolute values of PD were not a function of exercise tolerance for any of the parameters studied. The PD values for ET and pVO2 were normally distributed. The data suggest that a change in ET and pVO2 must exceed 27% and 28% between two sequential studies in an individual patient in order to be significant at the 5% level, respectively. For the one-tailed test situation, the changes in ET or pVO2 must be greater than 23% in order to be significant."
CD008691,0,8843118,0,Reproducibility of left ventricular volume measurements at rest and during bicycle exercise in patients with congestive heart failure: a combined radionuclide and haemodynamic study.,"A series of 14 patients with heart failure due to coronary artery disease and impaired left ventricular function underwent radionuclide ventriculography with simultaneous thermodilution measurement of cardiac output by pulmonary artery catheter on two occasions (m1, m2) separated by 6 weeks in order to determine the reproducibility of haemodynamic and left ventricular volume measurements at rest and during supine bicycle exercise. The patients were in NYHA grade II or III and had baseline left ventricular ejection fractions below 40%. Derived haemodynamic variables were calculated from the thermodilution cardiac output and from the radionuclide ejection fraction as follows: stroke volume = thermodilution cardiac output/heart rate; left ventricular end-diastolic volume = stroke volume/ejection fraction; left ventricular end-systolic volume = end-diastolic volume - stroke volume. The percentage difference (PD) between each pair of data (m1, m2) was calculated using the following formula: PD = 100% x (m2-m1)/m1. The data showed that reproducible measurements of left ventricular volume can be obtained at rest and during exercise. The mean (+/- S.D.) PD values for end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume at rest were - 0.1 +/- 17% and - 0.2 +/- 13%, respectively. The mean PD values for end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume during exercise were - 0.3 +/- 19% and - 0.7 +/- 15%, respectively. By contrast, the reproducibility of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure measurements was poor, as reflected by a PD value of 14 +/- 51% for exercise pulmonary capillary pressure. Combining radionuclide ventriculography and the thermodilution measurement of cardiac output is useful for measuring left ventricular volume at rest and during exercise in patients with heart failure. This minimally invasive technique allows for a comprehensive assessment of left ventricular performance and appears to be particularly suited for assessing the effects of therapeutic interventions aimed at minimizing the progressive left ventricular enlargement in heart failure."
CD008691,0,3518165,0,A critical look at survival of diabetics with end-stage renal disease. Transplantation versus dialysis therapy.,"The survival of 100 consecutive patients with diabetic nephropathy after treatment with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or renal transplantation was reviewed at our institution from 1976 to 1982. Standard actuarial survival analysis revealed an overall survival of 83% and 61% at one and two years, respectively. Coronary angiography was used as a screening procedure for renal transplantation. In the dialysis group, 27 patients were considered acceptable transplant candidates on the basis of the coronary angiography but were not transplanted for other reasons. When the survival analysis was limited to those ""transplant candidates"" the survival rates were 78%, 51%, and 8% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. In comparison, survival after transplantation was 81%, 67%, and 45%, at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. In order to eliminate bias, survival comparisons were subsequently made using the Cox Proportional Hazard Model to take into account the time the transplant patients spent on dialysis prior to renal transplantation. When this analysis was performed, there was no significant difference in survival between transplantation and dialysis for the first two years, but overall survival after five years was significantly better after renal transplantation even when the comparison was limited to acceptable transplant candidates who remained on dialysis (P = .04). Survival for patients with significant coronary disease (greater than 70% stenosis of a coronary vessel or moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction) was analyzed according to therapeutic modality. Although overall prognosis was poor in this group as a whole (1, 2, and 5 year survivals were 76%, 45%, and 19%, respectively), the cardiac patients had a trend to better survival after renal transplantation than when maintained on dialysis (P = .22). In addition to other factors such as quality of life, rehabilitation, and progression of other diabetic complications, the benefit of renal transplantation on patient survival must be considered when deciding between renal transplantation and maintenance dialysis therapy for diabetic patients with renal failure."

CD008691,0,6657654,0,Myocardial perfusion and left ventricular performance during long and short haemodialysis in patients with coronary heart disease.,In seven patients with confirmed coronary heart disease and stable blood pressure control acetate haemodialysis improved left ventricular performance and exercise tolerance. Similar positive effects were obtained by a four hour dialysis (one litre fluid removal/hour) and a two hour dialysis (two litre fluid removal/hour). In this group of patients weight gain and overhydration between dialyses appears to be the major risk for myocardial perfusion and rapid weight reduction by acetate dialysis appears adequate therapy. One practical consequence from our study is to minimise fluid overload in coronary heart disease and we try to avoid iatrogenic induction of thirst by decreasing dialysate sodium from 140 mmol/litre to 125-135 mmol/litre. As far as myocardial risk factors are concerned it appears that it is more important to focus on interdialysis weight gains than on acute dialysis therapy.
CD008691,0,17087427,0,Preventing cardiovascular disease in women.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the primary cause of death in women for almost a century, and more women than men have died of CVD every year since 1984. Although CVD incidence can be reduced by adherence to a heart-healthy lifestyle and detection and treatment of major risk factors, preventive recommendations have not been consistently or optimally applied to women. The American Heart Association guidelines for CVD prevention in women provide physicians with a clear plan for assessment and treatment of CVD risk and personalization of treatment recommendations. The emphasis of preventive efforts has shifted away from treatment of individual CVD risk factors in isolation toward assessment of a woman's overall or ""global"" CVD risk. In addition to accounting for the presence or absence of preexisting coronary heart disease or its equivalents (e.g., diabetes, chronic kidney disease), cardiovascular risk can be further calculated with the Framingham risk score, which is based on age, sex, smoking history, and lipid and blood pressure levels. Intervention intensity and treatment goals are tailored to overall risk, with those at highest risk receiving the most intense risk-lowering interventions. Women at high risk for CVD and without contraindications should receive aspirin, beta blockers, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in addition to pharmacologic therapy for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. Women who already are at optimal or low risk for CVD should be encouraged to maintain or further improve their healthy lifestyle practices. Optimal application of these preventive practices significantly reduces the burden of death and disability caused by heart attack and stroke in women."

CD008691,0,16647439,0,Does contrast medium administration in organ donors affect early kidney graft function?,"Since the upper age for organ donors has been raised, a higher incidence of preexistent organ damage and functional impairment is to be expected. Coronary artery sclerosis increases with age. It can only be diagnosed with certainty by coronary angiography. Since contrast medium administration may cause renal damage when risk factors are present, this study sought to establish whether angiography negatively influenced the early postoperative function of kidney grafts. We compared the clinical courses of 36 recipients of kidneys from donors in whom coronary angiography or levography had been performed with 36 recipients of kidneys from donors who had not been subjected to contrast medium. The results showed that the administration of contrast medium had no influence on renal function at 3 or 6 months after transplantation. In conclusion, fears that donor kidneys might be harmed by contrast medium appeared to therefore be unfounded."

CD008691,0,1357450,0,Coronary revascularisation in insulin-dependent diabetic patients with chronic renal failure.,"Insulin-dependent diabetic patients found to have substantial coronary artery disease at the time of assessment for renal transplantation have 2-year survival of less than 50%. Because most of these patients have no angina symptoms their management is controversial. We tried to find out whether coronary artery revascularisation in such patients might decrease the combined incidence of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death. 151 consecutive insulin-dependent diabetic candidates for renal transplantation underwent coronary angiography. 31 had stenoses greater than 75% in one or more coronary arteries, atypical chest pain or no chest pain, and a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 0.35. Of these, 26 agreed to be randomly assigned medical treatment (a calcium-channel-blocking drug plus aspirin) or revascularisation (angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery). 10 of 13 medically managed and 2 of 13 revascularised patients had a cardiovascular endpoint within a median of 8.4 months of coronary angiography (p < 0.01). 4 medically managed patients died of myocardial infarction during follow-up. Thus, revascularisation decreased the frequency of cardiac events in insulin-dependent diabetic patients with chronic renal failure and symptomless coronary artery stenoses. These findings suggest that diabetic renal transplant candidates should be screened for silent coronary artery disease, because revascularisation may decrease cardiac morbidity and mortality in this population."

CD008691,0,775643,0,Radionuclide angiography.,"Radionuclide angiography is an established, widely used diagnostic tool. It is safe, easy to perform, and the low patient radiation dose makes frequent follow-up studies feasible. High-quality scintiscans have contributed to the widespread clinical acceptance of the procedure. The areas of application include virtually every organ of the body. In the brain, abnormalities in cerebral perfusion may be detected with this technique. Hepatic and renal tumors can be differentiated from cysts with radionuclide angiography. Its application to cardiology is achieving rapid growth and acceptance in both congenital and acquired heart disease."

CD008691,0,11999668,0,Dobutamine stress radionuclide ventriculography reveals silent myocardial dysfunction in Kawasaki disease.,"Dobutamine (DOB) stress radionuclide ventriculography (RVG) is proposed for evaluating left ventricular performance in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD). Dobutamine stress RVG, up to 15 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1), was performed in 40 patients with a history of KD, some of whom had a perfusion defect (PD group) on dipyridamole stress thallium-201 myocardial imaging, some of whom had no perfusion defects (NPD group), and some of whom had no coronary artery lesions (C group). No significant differences in either systolic or diastolic indices of the left ventricle at rest were observed between the 3 groups. Although hemodynamic responses were similar in all patients after DOB stress, early diastolic index of the first third filling fraction decreased only in the PD group and was significantly lower in this group compared with the C group (p<0.01). The asynchrony index increased significantly in those patients with coronary stenosis after DOB stress (p<0.05). No serious side-effects were observed during the study. Even late after onset, patients with myocardial ischemia as a result of KD still had impaired early diastolic filling and asynchronous relaxation of the left ventricle. As an alternative to exercise testing, DOB stress RVG is a safe and promising means for serially evaluating left ventricular performance in patients with KD."

CD008691,0,2353652,1,Prognostic value of intravenous dipyridamole thallium imaging in patients with diabetes mellitus considered for renal transplantation.,"Patients with diabetes and end-stage renal failure are known to have a high risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality associated with renal transplantation. The most efficient method to determine preoperative cardiac risk has not been established. To determine the effectiveness of intravenous dipyridamole thallium imaging in predicting cardiac events, 40 diabetic renal transplant candidates were studied preoperatively in a prospective trial. The study group consisted of 40 patients whose average age was 42 years (range 27 to 64); 34 (85%) were hypertensive and 21 (53%) were cigarette smokers. Cardiac history included chest pain in 6 patients and prior myocardial infarction in 3 patients. Dipyridamole thallium imaging showed reversible defects in 9 patients, fixed defects in 8 patients and normal scans in 23 patients. Dipyridamole thallium imaging was performed using 0.56 mg/kg of dipyridamole infused intravenously over 4 minutes. Cardiac events occurred only in patients with reversible thallium defects, of which there were 6. Of these 6 patients, 3 had cardiac events before transplantation and 3 had them in the early postoperative phase (within 6 weeks of surgery). Of 21 patients who underwent renal transplantation, 3 had cardiac events within 6 weeks of transplantation. The average duration of follow-up was 11 months (range 1 to 21). Thus, dipyridamole thallium imaging is an effective method of identifying renal transplant candidates likely to develop cardiac complications. Routine coronary angiography may not be necessary to screen all renal transplant candidates for coronary artery disease before surgery."

CD008691,0,19179987,0,Indications for coronary artery bypass grafting in 2009: what is left to surgery.,"Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains the most common procedure performed by cardiac surgeons, yet it is clear that the landscape of coronary intervention is constantly changing as new technology is introduced and data from countless studies continues to be published. However, no single study will be able to clearly define the indications for surgical versus percutaneous revascularization in every clinical scenario given the complexity of this disease as well as that of the patients it afflicts. Moreover, the significant improvements in percutaneous therapy, medical therapy management, perioperative care and secondary prevention after revascularization have decreased the morbidity and mortality of coronary artery disease making comparison between therapies far more difficult. Based on the available literature to date, surgical revascularization (CABG) provides significant benefit in certain patient populations; particularly those with comorbid conditions (for example diabetes, left ventricular [LV] dysfunction) and with more severe disease (for example left main, three-vessel). The goal of this article is to outline the current for surgical revascularization (CABG) understanding that coronary artery disease will continue be an important cause of morbidity and mortality and further study and re-evaluation of these recommendations will likely be necessary as time goes on."

Data on the reliability and validity of high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) in patients with CKD is lacking. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inter- and intra-reviewer agreement and inter-scan reproducibility of CACS measurement with HRCT in a cohort of patients with CKD prior to dialysis, and to compare the change in CACS at 30 minutes to the change in CACS over 1 year."
CD008691,0,19339406,0,Pediatric myocardial stunning underscores the cardiac toxicity of conventional hemodialysis treatments.,"In adults, hemodialysis (HD)-induced ischemia causes reversible myocardial dysfunction (myocardial stunning) that is progressive with raised attendant mortality. Children share an increased risk for death from a spectrum of uremia-related cardiovascular abnormalities but in the absence of significant classical atheromatous coronary artery disease; therefore, we elected to assess children who were on HD for the occurrence of myocardial stunning to investigate the relative importance of characteristic uremic cardiovascular abnormalities in the development of ischemic cardiac injury."
CD008691,0,1828650,0,Therapy with recombinant human erythropoietin reduces cardiac size and improves heart function in chronic hemodialysis patients.,"The substitution of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) in chronic hemodialysis patients is often associated with the development of severe hypertension. In the present study, a systematical echocardiographic analysis was performed in 25 patients on maintenance hemodialysis during rhEPO therapy for at least 4 months. Referred to the total group, indices of left ventricular size decreased significantly. Left ventricular total volume and left ventricular mass were reduced considerably. Fractional fiber shortening and ejection fraction showed an impressing improvement. At a constant heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output were reduced. Myocardial thickness did not alter under chronic rhEPO therapy. When subgroups were formed with respect to changes in blood pressure, all parameters investigated behaved very similar to the total group, irrespective of changes in blood pressure. Five patients with coronary heart disease and clinical signs of myocardial insufficiency were evaluated separately. These patients showed a decrease in left ventricular size and no evidence of a deterioration of myocardial function. We conclude from our results that rhEPO therapy in patients on maintenance renal replacement therapy has beneficial effects on left ventricular size and function; these effects are not significantly counteracted by the development of hypertension."

CD008691,0,3049845,0,"Correlations between quantitative cineangiography, coronary flow reserve measured with digital subtraction cineangiography and exercise thallium perfusion scintigraphy.","The goal of this investigation was to establish which anatomical parameters of stenotic lesions correlate best with its functional severity. Therefore, thirty-eight patients with single vessel disease underwent coronary cineangiography and exercise/redistribution thallium-201 scintigraphy. Cross-sectional area at the site of obstruction (OA), percentage diameter stenosis (DS), the calculated pressuredrop over the stenosis (PD), as well as coronary flow reserve (CFR) derived from myocardial contrast appearance time and density were determined. The relations between CFR and the 3 anatomical parameters were described by the following equations: CFR = 4.6 - 0.053 DS, r = 0.82, SEE: 0.79, p less than 0.001 CFR = 0.5 + 0.75 OA, r = 0.87, SEE: 0.68, p less than 0.001 CFR = 3.6 - 1.5 log PD, r = 0.90, SEE: 0.62, p less than 0.001 The calculated pressuredrop was highly predictive of the thallium scintigraphic results with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 90%. Therefore, the calculated pressuredrop is a better anatomical parameter for assessing the functional importance of a stenosis than percentage diameter stenosis or obstruction area. However, the 95% confidence limits of the relation between pressuredrop and coronary flow reserve are wide, making measurement of CFR a valuable addition to quantitative angiography, especially when determining the functional importance of moderately severe coronary artery lesions."

Our objective was to prospectively examine the association of aortic calcification with cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality among asymptomatic incident renal transplant recipients.
CD008691,0,20006800,0,Impact of comorbidities on decision-making in chronic critical limb ischemia.,"Given both the high-risk nature of the critical limb ischemia (CLI) patient population, as well as the variety of available treatment options, the ability to use preprocedure variables to predict a given outcome has become increasingly important. The three main advantages associated with accurate risk stratification include: (1) improved clinical decision-making based on realistic patient and physician expectations, (2) ability to benchmark individual practitioners and institutions by comparing their outcomes with expected outcomes specific to the actual patients being treated, and (3) creation of objective performance goals for the evaluation of new treatment modalities in specific patient populations. Patients with CLI have multiple comorbidities that can impact greatly on the outcomes of attempted revascularization. The PREVENT III CLI Risk Score was developed as a tool to estimate amputation-free survival at 1 year in patients undergoing vein bypass surgery for limb salvage, and has now been validated using data from >3,000 cases. The score incorporates five baseline clinical variables-dialysis, tissue loss, age, hematocrit, and coronary artery disease-and assigns patients into three distinct risk groups. Patients in the high-risk subgroup (8.2% of total number of patients evaluated) experienced <50% amputation-free survival at 1 year. This tool may be valuable in assisting both the surgeon and patient faced with treatment decisions in CLI."
CD008691,0,10352196,1,Dobutamine stress echocardiography for the detection of significant coronary artery disease in renal transplant candidates.,"Prophylactic coronary revascularization may reduce the risk for cardiac events in diabetic renal transplant candidates. No published data exist on the accuracy of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) for the diagnosis of angiographically defined coronary artery disease (CAD) in renal transplant candidates. The purpose of this study is to examine the accuracy of DSE for the detection of CAD in high-risk renal transplant candidates compared with coronary angiography. Fifty renal transplant candidates with diabetic nephropathy (39 patients) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) from other causes (11 patients) underwent prospectively performed DSE, followed by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and qualitative visual assessment of CAD severity. Twenty of 50 DSE tests were positive for inducible ischemia. Twenty-seven patients (54%) had a stenosis of 50% or greater by QCA, 12 patients (24%) had a stenosis of greater than 70% by QCA, and 16 patients (32%) had a stenosis greater than 75% by visual estimation. The sensitivity and specificity of DSE for CAD diagnosis were respectively 52% and 74% compared with QCA stenosis of 50% or greater, 75% and 71% compared with QCA stenosis greater than 70%, and 75% and 76% for stenosis greater than 75% by visual estimate. On long-term follow-up (22.5 +/- 10.1 months), 6 of 30 patients (20%) with negative DSE results and 11 of 20 patients (55%) with positive DSE results had a cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), or coronary revascularization. Six of 27 patients (22%) with a QCA stenosis of 50% or greater had a cardiac death or MI compared with none of the 23 patients (0%) with QCA stenosis less than 50% (P = 0.025). We conclude that DSE is a useful but imperfect screening test for angiographically defined CAD in renal transplant candidates."
CD008691,0,14997923,0,"Is obesity a predictor of mortality, morbidity and readmission after cardiac surgery?","Obesity has been described as a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease, but it has not been determined whether obesity is associated with adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery. Therefore, we analyzed a large cohort of patients who had undergone cardiac surgery to determine whether obesity is a predictor of mortality, morbidity or early readmission to hospital."
CD008691,0,20102936,0,Usefulness of atorvastatin (80 mg) in prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with chronic renal disease.,"We investigated the efficacy of short-term high-dose atorvastatin in decreasing the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) subjected to coronary angiography and/or angioplasty. CIN occurs in up to 15% of patients with pre-existing CKD and affects clinical outcome. The protective effect of statin therapy against CIN is still controversial. A prospective, single-center study of 304 patients with baseline estimated creatinine clearance <60 ml/min were randomized to receive atorvastatin 80 mg/day or placebo for 48 hours before and 48 hours after contrast medium administration. All patients received intravenous saline hydration and oral N-acetylcysteine 1,200 mg 2 times/day. Iso-osmolar contrast medium was used. CIN was defined as an absolute increase of serum creatinine > or = 0.5 mg/dl within 5 days after the procedure. CIN occurred in 31 patients (10%), 16 (11%) in the placebo group and 15 (10%) in the atorvastatin group (p = 0.86). Mean increase in creatinine was not significantly different in the 2 groups (0.59 + or - 0.17 in placebo group vs 0.72 + or - 0.26 mg/dl in atorvastatin group, p = 0.31). Persistent kidney injury, defined as 1-month increase from baseline creatinine value > or = 25%, was observed in 30% in the placebo group and in 31% in the atorvastatin group (p = 0.58). In conclusion, a short-term administration of high doses of atorvastatin before and after contrast exposure, in addition to standard intravenous hydration and oral N-acetylcysteine, does not decrease CIN occurrence in patients with pre-existing CKD."
CD008691,0,3403826,0,Which cineangiographically assessed anatomic variable correlates best with functional measurements of stenosis severity? A comparison of quantitative analysis of the coronary cineangiogram with measured coronary flow reserve and exercise/redistribution thallium-201 scintigraphy.,"The goal of this investigation was to establish which measured anatomic variable of stenotic coronary lesions correlates best with functional severity. Therefore, 38 patients with single vessel disease underwent coronary cineangiography and exercise/redistribution thallium-201 scintigraphy. The computer-based Cardiovascular Angiography Analysis System was used to determine the cross-sectional area at the site of obstruction (OA) and percent diameter stenosis (DS), and to calculate the pressure drop over the stenosis (PD) with use of fluid dynamic equations. Coronary flow reserve was measured radiographically. Myocardial perfusion defects on thallium scintigrams were analyzed quantitatively and by visual interpretation. The relations between coronary flow reserve (CFR) and the three anatomic variables were described by the following equations: 1) CFR = 4.6 - 0.053 DS, r = 0.82; SEE: 0.79, p less than 0.001. 2) CFR = 0.5 + 0.75 OA, r = 0.87; SEE: 0.68, p less than 0.001). 3 CFR = 3.6 - 1.5 log PD, r = 0.90; SEE: 0.62, p less than 0.001. The calculated pressure drop was highly predictive of the thallium scintigraphic results with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 90%. The calculated pressure drop is a better anatomic variable for assessing the functional importance of a stenosis than is percent diameter stenosis or obstruction area. However, the 95% confidence limits of the relation between pressure drop and coronary flow reserve are wide, making the measurement of coronary flow reserve an indispensable addition to quantitative angiography, especially when determining the functional importance of moderately severe coronary artery lesions."
CD008691,0,16911184,0,Independent risk factors for progression of coronary atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients.,"Not uncommonly, hemodialysis patients with normal results in myocardial perfusion tests can still have a cardiac event within 2 years of evaluation. We examined possible risk factors for progression of coronary atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. We prospectively evaluated ability of myocardial perfusion imaging carried out under pharmacologic stress to predict 2-year outcomes in 77 hemodialysis patients, specifically thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using high-dose adenosine triphosphate as the stressor. The primary end-point was a cardiac event (cardiac death, non-fatal acute coronary syndrome, or hospitalization for acute ischemic heart failure). Factors independently influencing duration until a cardiac event in hemodialysis patients were identified using stepwise multiple regression analysis. Myocardial perfusion defects were shown in 36 patients. Patients with a perfusion defect were more likely to have cardiac events than those with normal perfusion (78% vs. 15%, P < 0.001). Time until occurrence of a cardiac event in hemodialysis patients showed a significant, independent association with known coronary artery disease [regression coefficient (RC) = -3.391, P = 0.046], elevated C-reactive protein (RC = -5.813, P = 0.005), and a reversible myocardial perfusion defect (RC = -7.386, P < 0.001). An analysis based on the 'best cut-off' of CRP as identified on the basis of the ROC curve augmented the positive and negative predict value of CRP for the prediction of coronary events to 65 and 74%, respectively. Myocardial perfusion SPECT and measuring the plasma concentration of CRP might be useful for the prediction of hemodialysis patients with progression of coronary atherosclerosis."

However, studies investigating the relationship between CIMT and brachial artery FMD% in different populations have produced conflicting results. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between CIMT and brachial artery FMD% in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) METHODS: Fifty-two PD patients without known cardiovascular disease and 30 age-gender matched controls were included in the study. Endothelial function was determined using ultrasonography (US) to measure the FMD of the brachial artery, and this parameter was expressed as the percentage change from the baseline diameter of the brachial artery (FMD%). We also measured CIMT by US and analysed the relationship between CIMT and brachial FMD%."

CD008691,0,16237683,0,When is diabetes mellitus a relative or absolute contraindication to liver transplantation?,"1. Diabetes mellitus is common in patients with cirrhosis; patients with DM undergoing liver transplantation often have many other co-morbid illnesses including obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD), autonomic neuropathy, gastroparesis, and nephropathy. 2. Long-term survival of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is significantly lower and morbidity higher when compared to non-diabetics mainly because of cardiovascular complications, infections, and renal failure. 3. Obesity, CAD, and renal failure are confounding factors that result in poor patient survival. 4. Patients with DM should undergo careful cardiovascular diagnostic work up, including routine coronary arteriogram, and necessary interventions before liver transplantation. This is especially important in those over 50 years old, and in those with retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. 5. Patients with coronary artery disease that is not amenable to surgery or stents, and those with impaired left ventricular function, should not be considered for liver transplantation. Other relative or absolute contraindications are those with proteinura and renal failure who are not candidates for combined liver/kidney transplantation, those with severe gastroparesis, especially when it is associated with diabetic autonomic neuropathy, and those with two or more risk factors such as CAD, morbid obesity, and renal failure. 6. Future studies should focus on risk stratification of patients with DM undergoing liver transplantation and better interventions to reduce the risk of diabetic complications before and after liver transplantation."

CD008691,0,2309593,0,Short- and long-term outcome of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in chronic dialysis patients.,"Accelerated atherosclerosis occurs in chronic renal failure. The role of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in chronic renal failure patients requiring dialysis has not been characterized. We studied 17 chronic dialysis patients requiring PTCA over a 6-year period. Their mean age was 60 years, four were diabetic, eight had severe hypertension, and seven had unstable angina. Angiographic success was achieved in 47 of 49 (96%) stenoses attempted, including multivessel PTCA in 12 patients. There was one procedural death, two non-Q wave myocardial infarctions following PTCA, and one additional in-hospital noncardiac death. The 15 survivors were asymptomatic on discharge (mean stay 11 days), but recurrent angina developed within 6 months in 12 patients. Angiography in 11 of these 12 patients demonstrated restenosis of 26 of 32 (81%) dilated sites. Repeat PTCA in six patients was followed by return of angina in four patients with restenosis in 11 of 12 sites. Bypass surgery was ultimately performed in four patients with long-term angina relief. During follow-up (mean 20 months), seven patients died (five from chronic renal failure, two cardiac deaths). Thus although PTCA in chronic dialysis patients is technically feasible and provides relief of angina, aggressive restenosis limits the long-term benefit. Coronary bypass surgery may be the preferred therapy for this unique patient group."

CD008691,0,10025064,0,"[Ulcer of the thoracic aorta: diagnosis, therapy and prognosis].","Penetrating aortic ulcers (PAU) result from progressive erosion of atheromatose plaques perforating the internal elastic lamina. PAU is considered both a predisposing condition and differential diagnosis of classic aortic dissection; 93 cases of PAU are documented in the world literature, 60% of which are male over 60 years old. Systemic hypertension was prevalent in 85%, history of smoking in 72%, hyperlipoproteinemia in 35%, and diabetes mellitus in 31%. In 61%, PAU was associated with coronary artery disease, in 53% with abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysm, in 31% with chronic renal insufficiency, in 17% with peripheral artery disease, and in 12% with a history of cerebrovascular accidents. In 73%, PAU was associated with formation of medial hematoma and in 16% with a thick, calcified intimal flap of less than 10 cm extent. Angiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and transesophageal echocardiography were used in 66, 64, 23 and 14%, respectively, for diagnosing PAU; sensitivities for demonstrating PAU were 83, 65, 86 and 61%, respectively. Chest or back pain was found in 76% and an acute onset of symptoms in 68%. Signs of mediastinal widening were found in 59%, neurologic signs comprising hoarseness, syncope or coma in 8%, pulse differentials caused by embolism in 4%, aortic regurgitation in 7%, and mediastinal hematoma, pleural- or pericardial effusion in 42, 27 and 10%, respectively. PAU of the ascending aorta or aortic arch (type A) leads to dissection and rupture in 57%, compared to 12% and 5%, respectively, in the descending aorta (type B); 57% of medically managed type A PAU patients died within 30 d of hospital admission compared to only 14% of type B PAU with 20 cases of uncomplicated long-term outcome without surgery. Thus, similar to the Stanford classification for aortic dissection, type A PAU should primarily be considered for surgical management, whereas type B PAU without signs of instability may be managed medically."

To examine these issues, we performed renal angiography in 410 patients with PAD. Renal function and damage were assessed using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary level of microalbumin (MA). Multiple logistic and multiple regression analyses were used to examine the relationships of potential risk factors with RAS and CKD. In all, 94 subjects (22.9%) had RAS >50% and 45 subjects (11.0%) had RAS >75%. The incidences of an abnormal level of MA and renal insufficiency (eGFR <60 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2)) were 37.0 and 60.7%, respectively. RAS > or =50% was associated with critical limb ischemia (CLI; hazard ratio (HR) 2.519; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.203-5.276, P=0.014), coronary heart disease (CHD; HR 2.143; 95% CI 1.129-4.069; P=0.020) and hypertension (HR 1.907; 95% CI 1.009-3.628; P=0.045). RAS > or =75% had a relationship with hypertension (HR 3.093; 95% CI 1.002-9.548; P=0.048). eGFR was negatively correlated with age, uric acid and CHD (P=0.013), and MA had a significant positive correlation with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, CLI, age, CHD and diabetes (P<0.001). These results show that the prevalences of RAS and CKD are very high in Japanese patients with PAD; that CLI and CHD are major risk factors for RAS; and that hyperuricemia, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes are risk factors for CKD in PAD. We also found that MA is a simple and noninvasive marker of renal dysfunction and general vascular damage."
CD008691,0,17085983,0,The acute effect of aerobic exercise on brachial artery endothelial function in renal transplant recipients.,"This study compared the effect of a 30-minute walk on brachial artery endothelial vasodilatation in kidney transplant (KT) recipients and healthy controls (HCs). Endothelial-dependent vasodilatation was measured by ultrasound before and after exercise. The HCs experienced a significant increase in vasodilatation after exercise 1 minute postocclusion when compared with the KT recipients (22%+/-13% vs 3%+/-4%; P<.05). Also, the HCs had a significantly higher vasodilatation from pre-treadmill walk to post-treadmill walk (1 minute postocclusion) when compared with KT recipients (from 3%+/-6% to 22%+/-13% vs 1%+/-3% to 3%+/-4%; P<.05). This acute vasodilatory response observed in the HCs may be related to the immediate release of nitric oxide and the combined response to shear stress and exercise. The KT recipients had several coronary artery disease risk factors that may have adversely affected endothelial function."
CD008691,0,16773801,0,[Takotsubo cardiomyopathy thought to be induced by MRSA meningitis and cervical epidural abscess in a maintenance-hemodialysis patient: case report].,"A 65-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for high fever and severe left shoulder pain. He was initiated on maintenance hemodialysis for end-stage renal failure caused by diabetic nephropathy 9 years previously. On admission, the serum CRP level was 29.3 mg/d/l and the white blood cell count was 29,000/mm3. Bacterial examination of blood and spinal fluid revealed MRSA colonization. On the 6th hospital day, a giant negative T wave in the V2-6 leads of an electrocardiogram asymptomatically appeared. Ultracardiogram revealed apical systolic paradoxical centrifugal motion. None of the cardiogenic enzymes, such as creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase was elevated. Cardiac thallium-201-chloride (201Tl-Cl) and I-123 beta-metyl iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (123I-BMIPP) scintigraphy revealed a decreased accumulation of isotopes in the apex. From these findings, we diagnosed Takotsubo cardiomyopathy induced by MRSA meningitis. Vancomycin was administrated and the inflammatory signs decreased. On the 46th hospital day, tetraplegia and respiratory suppression occurred. A cervical spinal magnetic resonance image revealed cervical spondylodiscitis and cervical epidural abscess, which compressed the medulla oblongata. Surgical spinal decompression and drainage of the abscess were performed. The giant negative T wave in the electrocardiogram improved after the operation. Two months after the operation, cardiac 201Tl-Cl scintigraphy revealed improvement in the accumulation of isotopes in the apex. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is secondary cardiomyopathy presenting with apical systolic paradoxical centrifugal motion without coronary stenotic disease. It has been reported to be induced by severe mental stress or intracranial disease. In the present patient, it was predicted that stress on the central nerve system caused by the MRSA meningitis and the cervical epidural abscess induced the Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
CD008691,0,17564063,0,[Nifekalant hydrochloride effective against perioperative ventricular tachycardia in patients with impaired left ventricular function].,"Perioperative ventricular tachycardia (VT) was treated with nifekalant hydrochloride, a pure potassium channel blocker in 2 patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The first patient is a 34-year-old woman, a chronic hemodialysis patient in whom severe aortic stenosis due to structural valvular deterioration of the previously implanted tissue valve was diagnosed with her LVEF of 26.9%. She underwent urgent redo aortic valve replacement with a mechanical valve. Postoperatively a sustained VT developed. After she received direct-current (DC) shock, nifekalant hydrochloride was administered. The 2nd patient is a 44-year-old man who presented with severe congestive heart failure. A coronary angiogram revealed triple vessel disease as well as decreased LVEF of 16% and ischemic mitral regurgitation. He underwent triple coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral ring annuloplasty. A VT developed requiring DC shock during hemostasis. Nifekalant hydrochloride was given immediately. In both patients, nifekalant hydrochloride was given intravenously in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg followed by a continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg/hr. Our experience shows nifekalant hydrochloride is effective against perioperative VT, especially in patients with impaired left ventricular function since it has mild positive inotropic effect."
CD008691,0,16109138,0,Role of sevelamer hydrochloride in the coronary artery calcification score.,"The coronary artery calcification score (CACS) is higher in hemodialysis (HD) patients than in non-HD patients for each age group from the fifth to the eighth decade of life. In order to clarify the relationship between the rate of change in the CACS and several factors related to calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) metabolism in HD patients, we determined the CACS twice in 144 HD outpatients at an interval of approximately 12 months (2003 and 2004). The dosage of vitamin D formulations (alfacalcidol or maxacalcitol) was reduced or ceased if the serum Ca concentration exceeded 5.0 mEq/L, or the serum P concentration exceeded 6.0 mg/dL, and the dosage of combined sevelamer hydrochloride (SH) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3), as the phosphate binder, was adjusted to maintain the concentrations below these levels. The study parameters were: (1) the total dosage of alfacalcidol (microg), maxacalcitol (microg), SH (mg), and CaCO3 at the time of each CACS measurement; and (2) serum concentrations of Ca, P, alkaline phosphatase, high-sensitivity parathyroid hormone (HS-PTH), total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG). Regression analysis showed a significant correlation among the total SH dosage, TG, and alphaCACS. Future investigations will include the differences in alphaCACS between patients treated with SH who experience a rise in Ca and/or P and those with a decrease in Ca and/or P."
CD008691,0,20093813,0,Haemodialysis-induced myocardial stunning in chronic kidney disease - a new aspect of cardiovascular disease.,"Chronic haemodialysis (HD) patients are already primed by a large number of structural and functional peripheral vascular and cardiac abnormalities to experience demand myocardial ischaemia. Transient myocardial ischaemia may lead to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction that can persist after the return of normal perfusion. This prolonged dysfunction is known as myocardial stunning. Repetitive episodes of ischaemia can be cumulative and have been shown to lead to prolonged LV dysfunction (in patients with ischaemic heart disease). Conventional HD itself is a sufficient cardiovascular functional stressor to precipitate such recurrent ischaemic insults, leading to myocardial functional and structural changes, eventually resulting in fixed systolic dysfunction and heart failure (conferring a dismal prognosis for patients undergoing dialysis). Furthermore these same haemodynamic insults may also adversely affect other vascular beds in other vulnerable organ systems, driving an even wider range of pathophysiological processes. A variety of therapeutic manoeuvres aimed at improving the haemodynamic tolerability of treatment have been shown to reduce acute dialysis-induced myocardial ischaemia. This article aims to give an appreciation of the possibility that modification of the dialysis treatment to improve tolerability of therapy may have the potential to provide us with additional therapeutic targets, to reduce currently excessive rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."
CD008691,0,15752228,0,Calcification and cardiovascular problems in renal failure.,"Extraosseus calcification has plagued management of renal failure since the beginning of hemodialysis, but the issue has largely been neglected because the impact on survival was thought to be limited. The recent recognition that hyperphosphatemia is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality, and particularly of cardiac mortality, has transformed the situation. Relatively stringent, though difficult to implement, guidelines have been proposed for the management of hyperphosphatemia. Important recent insights document that, for different reasons, both high and low turnover of bone disease increase the risk of vascular calcifications. Vascular calcification impacts cardiac death not only by complicating coronary atherosclerosis, but also by increasing the stiffness of central arteries, impacting on heart function (increased impedance, reduced coronary perfusion). While in the past extraosseous calcification, including vascular calcification, was thought to be a passive process resulting from transgression of a critical Ca x P product, recent studies show that the adverse effect of hyperphosphatemia is also mediated by active processes (e.g., induction of ""osteogenic"" genetic programs), and is modulated by calcification inhibitors."

CD008691,0,11865839,0,Ischemic renal disease in Kuwait.,"Ischemic renal disease (IRD) is a frequent cause of end-stage renal disease. Its prevalence is mainly known from autopsy or retrospective arteriographic studies. This prospective study was conducted in 115 subjects selected from 732 patients with advanced chronic renal failure (CRF). Only patients with clinical features suggestive of IRD were selected for this study. In addition to detailed clinical and laboratory evaluation, captopril renal scintigraphy was performed in selected cases. All subjects underwent renal arteriography and all were followed up for 18.4 +/- 11.4 months. Renovascular disease was seen in 15 patients and significant bilateral renal artery disease leading to IRD was observed in 13 (11.3%). Hence the prevalence of IRD in the advanced CRF patients was 1.7%. The majority of patients with IRD (8 [61%]) were above 46 years of age and there were more men than women (10:3). Atherosclerotic renovascular disease was the most common (10 [77%]), even though arthritis (1 [7.6%]), and fibromuscular dysplasia (2 [15.3%]) were also observed. Serum creatinine at time of presentation was significantly higher in patients with IRD (784 +/- 292, p = 0.043) compared to those who did not have IRD (359 +/- 126). Corrective procedures were performed in 5 patients. After treatment the improvement in serum creatinine in patients with IRD at 3 and 6 months (166 +/- 32 and 173 +/- 47, respectively) was significantly different (p < or = 0.05) compared to those who were not treated (610 +/- 194 and 645 +/- 220, respectively). Hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease were more prevalent in patients who had IRD compared to those with renal failure. The incidence of diabetes mellitus were similar in both groups. This study denotes a lower prevalence of IRD in the advanced CRF population; they had more severe renal failure at presentation but specific corrective treatment delayed progression of renal disease significantly."
CD008691,0,17699219,0,"Incidence, predictors, and associated outcomes of atrial fibrillation after kidney transplantation.","The risk for and predictors of atrial fibrillation (AF) after kidney transplantation are not well described. Registry data that were collected by the United States Renal Data System were used to investigate retrospectively new-onset AF among adult first renal allograft recipients and transplant candidates who received a transplant or were wait-listed in 1995 to 2001 with Medicare as the primary payer. AF events were ascertained from billing records, and participants were followed until loss of Medicare coverage or December 31, 2001. Cox hazards analysis was used to identify independent correlates of posttransplantation AF (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]) and to examine AF as an outcomes predictor. Among 31,136 eligible transplant recipients, the cumulative incidence of new-onset AF was 3.6% (95% CI 3.4 to 3.8%) and 7.3% (95% CI 7.0 to 7.6%) at 12 and 36 mo and declined below the demographics-adjusted cumulative incidence on the waiting list by approximately 17 mo. Risk factors for posttransplantation AF included older recipient age, male gender, white race, renal failure from hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Extended pretransplantation dialysis duration, posttransplantation diabetes, and graft failure were identified as potentially modifiable correlates of AF. In separate analyses, AF independently predicted death (AHR 3.2; 95% CI 2.9 to 3.6) and death-censored graft loss (AHR 1.9; 95% CI 1.6 to 2.3). As the population of renal transplant recipients grows older, the incidence and prevalence of AF among these patients will likely increase. Appropriate risk stratification may identify transplant recipients who are in need of close monitoring for and management of this adverse cardiovascular event."

CD008691,0,3294231,0,Removal of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and fibrinogen by precipitation with heparin at low pH: clinical application and experience.,"The clinical application of a new extracorporeal procedure (HELP) for the selective elimination of low-density lipoproteins and fibrinogen by heparin precipitation at acid pH is described. Plasma, obtained by filtration of whole blood through a 0.2 micron filter is continuously mixed with an equal volume of an acetate buffer (pH 4.85) containing heparin. After removal of the precipitated heparin complex by filtration, excess heparin is adsorbed to a specially developed filter, and the clear plasma filtrate is subject to bicarbonate dialysis/ultrafiltration to restore physiologic pH and remove excess fluid. The calculated efficiency for the elimination of low-density lipoproteins and fibrinogen from plasma by HELP is 100% and is therefore comparable to conventional plasmapheresis. However, the HELP system shows a high degree of specificity, with over 80% of total protein being returned to the patient. A total of over 350 treatment procedures have now been performed. Patient compliance and acceptance have been excellent, and no major complications have been observed. The system is therefore suitable for the treatment of severe hyper-beta-lipoproteinemia; its use for the treatment of coronary heart disease is currently under investigation in a prospective multicenter study in which treatment efficiency will be controlled by coronary angiography on 45 patients treated with HELP over a period of 2 years."

It was hypothesized that N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels could identify CAD and LVH in asymptomatic patients with CKD. Clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic data were collected prospectively in 54 ambulatory patients with CKD not requiring dialysis. CAD was defined by previous myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization. The median age was 70 years (interquartile range [IQR] 57 to 76). Fourteen patients (26%) had CAD, and 30 (56%) had LVH. Median NT-pro-BNP was 724 pg/ml (IQR 168 to 2,950), median BNP was 137 pg/ml (IQR 31 to 391), and the median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 31 ml/min/1.73 m2 (IQR 21 to 42). A strong correlation was found between NT-pro-BNP and BNP levels (R = 0.74, p <0.0001), but only moderate correlations were found between NT-pro-BNP and GFR (R = -0.45, p = 0.0006) and between BNP and GFR (R = -0.38, p = 0.005). There was no trend of an increase in the prevalence of LVH or CAD with decreasing GFR. However, across progressive NT-pro-BNP and BNP quartiles, the prevalences of LVH and CAD increased significantly. Receiver-operating characteristic curves showed that these 2 markers are similar and significant predictors for indicating LVH (area under the curve [AUC] 0.72, p = 0.005 for NT-pro-BNP; AUC 0.72, p = 0.007 for BNP) and CAD (AUC 0.80, p = 0.001 for NT-pro-BNP; AUC 0.82, p = 0.0004 for BNP; p = 0.45 for NT-pro-BNP vs BNP).

However, few studies have assessed the outcome in such patients. This study investigated the clinical characteristics, treatment modalities, and prognosis for patients with angina pectoris accompanied by CRF and evaluated the validity of current treatment strategy for these patients. A total of 593 patients (248 with stable angina and 345 with unstable angina) admitted to our institution were studied. Renal failure was defined as serum creatinine of > or = 2.0 mg/dl. Patients were divided into 2 groups, with renal failure (46 patients) and without renal failure (547 patients), and the former group was further divided into 2 groups with hemodialysis (26 patients) and without hemodialysis (20 patients). The mean follow-up period was 2.5 +/- 1.2 years and the follow-up rate was 99%. The prevalences of congestive heart failure (26% vs 3%, p < 0.001), hypertension (72% vs 45%, p < 0.005), and multivessel coronary artery disease (65% vs 33%, p < 0.001) were higher in patients with CRF.

The incidence of re-hospitalization due to congestive heart failure was higher in patients with CRF (19% vs 1.3%, p < 0.0001). The cumulative survival in CRF was 93% at 1 year, 57% at 3 years in the medical treatment group and 87% and 75% in the invasive therapy group, respectively (p = 0.1). Patients with angina pectoris and CRF had a poor prognosis under the current treatment strategy.

We investigated whether CKD stage affected coronary lesion morphology in patients with established CAD. Coronary angiograms of 264 patients were evaluated. Chronic kidney disease was staged using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from the serum creatinine prior to coronary angiography. Patients were divided into 3 groups: dialysis or severe decrease in GFR <30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (group 1; n = 60), patients with moderate kidney failure (group 2; n = 116), and patients with normal renal function or mild decrease in GFR (group 3; n = 88). The likelihood of CAD and lesion complexity increased with decreasing eGFR (P = .001). Patients with CKD also had more significant CAD. The risk of significant coronary obstruction and lesion complexity increased progressively with decreasing eGFR.

CD008691,0,8020052,0,[Transesophageal coronary flowmetry and ventricular diastolic properties in surgically treated aortic insufficiency].,"In patients with aortic valve regurgitation anginal pain without coronary artery disease is a consequence of both impairment of coronary flow (CF) reserve and reduction of diastolic CF (D) due to a diminished coronary perfusion pressure (CPP). Aim of this study was to evaluate with transesophageal multiplane echocardiography CF pattern in 15 patients with severe aortic regurgitation (AR) in the operative room before and after aortic valve replacement and to correlate it with hemodynamic parameters of left ventricular systolic (echocardiographic fractional shortening area) and diastolic (Doppler E/A ratio of mitral flow and X/Y ratio of pulmonary venous flow; pulmonary wedge pressure) function. Patients were compared to a control group (C) of 10 subjects. Coronary flow was divided into systolic (S), protodiastolic (PD) and end-diastolic (ED) components. In AR we observed a reduction in D/S ratio (2.6 +/- 1.3 versus 3.5 +/- 0.8, NS) and an increase in PD/ED ratio (2.24 +/- 2.8 versus 1.05 +/- 0.15, p < 0.001). A positive correlation was observed between PD/ED ratio and left ventricular diastolic impairment (E/A ratio: r = 0.71, p < 0.001; wedge pressure: r = 0.70, p < 0.001) and a negative correlation with CPP (r = -0.6, p < 0.02). Forty-five min after aortic valve replacement diastolic function improvement and CPP increase were associated with a normalization of CF pattern (D/S = 4.35 +/- 1.9/PD/ED = 1.06 +/- 0.16). In conclusion in AR diastolic dysfunction and abnormal CPP are strictly related to the reduction in diastolic CF; valve replacement normalizes the former two parameters and redistributes CF in late diastole."

Severe coronary disease in a 21-year old woman with nephrocalcinosis due to infantile hypercalcemia syndrome].,"Cardiovascular diseases are very common in patients with end-stage renal disease and are the underlying cause of approximately half the deaths in dialysis patients. In those patients vascular calcifications are typically seen in the tunica media and therefore represent histopathological changes different to those in atherosclerosis. For the evaluation of cardiovascular risk in chronic dialysis patients, a method is needed to reliably identify patients who have to undergo invasive diagnostics. Coronary artery calcium assessed by electron beam computed tomography (EBT) has been suggested to measure the extent of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with normal renal function. It might also be of value in the stratification of cardiovascular risk in patients with renal failure."

CD008691,0,17921462,0,Hydration and disease.,"Many diseases have multifactorial origins. There is increasing evidence that mild dehydration plays a role in the development of various morbidities. In this review, effects of hydration status on acute and chronic diseases are depicted (excluding the acute effects of mild dehydration on exercise performance, wellness, cognitive function, and mental performance) and categorized according to four categories of evidence (I-IV). Avoidance of a high fluid intake as a precautionary measure may be indicated in patients with cardiovascular disorders, pronounced chronic renal failure (III), hypoalbuminemia, endocrinopathies, or in tumor patients with cisplatin therapy (IIb) and menace of water intoxication. Acute systemic mild hypohydration or dehydration may be a pathogenic factor in oligohydramnios (IIa), prolonged labor (IIa), cystic fibrosis (III), hypertonic dehydration (III), and renal toxicity of xenobiotica (Ib). Maintaining good hydration status has been shown to positively affect urolithiasis (Ib) and may be beneficial in treating urinary tract infection (IIb), constipation (III), hypertension (III), venous thromboembolism (III), fatal coronary heart disease (III), stroke (III), dental disease (IV), hyperosmolar hyperglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (IIb), gallstone disease (III), mitral valve prolapse (IIb), and glaucoma (III). Local mild hypohydration or dehydration may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of several broncho-pulmonary disorders like exercise asthma (IIb) or cystic fibrosis (Ib). In bladder and colon cancers, the evidence on hydration status' effects is inconsistent."

CD008691,0,17463198,0,Is incidental renal arteriography justified in a population of patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease?,"Renal artery stenosis is a consequence of generalized atherosclerosis and many specialists perform routine selective renal angiography to detect and treat renal artery stenosis. The incidence of clinically important renal artery stenosis is not well defined in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. The purpose of this study was to better delineate the incidence of and the risk factors associated with renal artery stenosis, renovascular hypertension, and ischemic nephropathy incidentally discovered during angiography for symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Two hundred consecutive patients undergoing angiographic evaluation of symptomatic lower extremity peripheral arterial disease were studied retrospectively. Angiograms were reviewed for the presence of renal artery stenosis (defined as >or= 25% diameter reduction in either renal artery) and findings were then correlated to the clinical diagnosis of renovascular hypertension (> 50% renal artery stenosis and >or= 3-drug resistive hypertension) and ischemic nephropathy (defined as > 50% bilateral renal artery stenosis, 3-drug hypertension, and creatinine >or= 1.5). Angiographic findings were also correlated with risk factors to determine if a relationship correlated to the presence of and degree of renal artery stenosis. Data were analyzed using the Student's t test, Chi-square model, and multiple logistic regression analysis. The overall incidence of any degree of renal artery stenosis in this study population was 26% (52 patients). Only 24 (12%) patients had an incidental finding of >or= 50% stenosis in either renal artery. Six (3%) of these patients were found to have associated renovascular hypertension. Additionally, 9 (4.5%) patients had coexistent renal insufficiency and significant renal artery stenosis; five with end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis. Only one patient with end-stage renal disease had poorly controlled 3-drug hypertension. Thus definitive ischemic nephropathy was present in only one (0.5%) patient. Statistically significant risk factors associated with the presence of renal artery stenosis include hypertension (P < .001), coronary disease (P = .024), female gender (P = .010), diabetes (P = .039), aorto-iliac disease (P = .031), multiple levels of peripheral arterial disease (P < .001), and age over 60 ( P < .001). While the incidence of renal artery stenosis in patients being evaluated for symptomatic peripheral arterial disease is similar to that reported in the cardiology literature, the incidence of renovascular hypertension and ischemic nephropathy is exceedingly low (3% and 0.5%, respectively)-findings similar to data reported in the general hypertensive population. These data suggest that incidental selective renal angiography is not justified in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease."
CD008691,0,18984459,0,Clinical utility of myocardial fatty acid imaging in patients with end-stage renal disease.,"The prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) appears to be much higher in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing dialysis than in a non-ESRD population. Cardiac death due to myocardial ischemia significantly contributes to the high mortality rate of ESRD patients. However, the method for screening for CAD in ESRD patients has not been established, because the frequency of silent myocardial ischemia is high and examinations requiring stress are often difficult to perform among this population. Myocardial fatty acid imaging may be a new modality to detect myocardial ischemia and identify the group at high risk for cardiac death among ESRD patients without adding any stress."
CD008691,0,19601862,0,Arterial accelerated aging in dialysis patients: the clinical impact of vascular calcification.,"Chronic Kidney Disease Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) is a systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism that occurs in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). In addition to abnormalities in serum calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) profile, CKD-MBD is characterized by abnormalities of bone turnover, mineralization, volume and growth as well as vascular calcification (VC). Indeed, the co-localization of bone markers such as Osteopontin, Alkaline Phosphatase and Osteocalcin along with osteoblast-like cells in the contest of the arterial wall of uremic patients, indicate that VC is an active biological process with peculiar analogies with bone mineralization. Thus, VC represents a plausible link between Ca and P derangements and the increased mortality associated with CKD-MBD. The process of VC starts in early stages of CKD and patients with CKD-3, -4 and -5 not undergoing haemodialysis may present a significant burden of calcification in the coronaries. Considering that presence and extent of VC in CKD portend poor prognosis, many efforts have been made to shed light on this complicated phenomenon to prevent VC deposition and progression. Indeed, careful control of calcium load, serum P and parathyroid hormone along with the use of calcium-free P binders and vitamin D analogs represent our current armamentarium to improve quality of life and reduce mortality in CKD. We herein summarize the current understanding and evidence supporting strategies available for VC treatment."

CD008691,0,7051035,0,Antithrombotic effects of drugs which suppress platelet function: their potential in prevention growth of tumour cells.,"Four drugs that inhibit platelet function have been evaluated for their antithrombotic effects in humans. These are aspirin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and sulphinpyrazone. Aspirin has been shown to reduce the number of transient ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke and death in patients with multiple TIA. The reduction in TIA was greatest in males who were normotensive and when there was an angiographically demonstrated lesion in the carotid artery that accounted for the symptoms. Aspirin reduced venous thrombosis and non-fatal and fatal pulmonary embolism in patients after surgery for fractured hip and after elective hip replacement. There is evidence that the prophylactic effect of aspirin may be greater in male patients. Aspirin reduced the frequency of arteriovenous shunt thrombosis. Aspirin abolished symptoms in patients with peripheral ischemia associated with thrombocytosis and spontaneous platelet aggregation. There is no conclusive evidence at the present time that aspirin is effective in patients with coronary artery artery disease. Dipyridamole in combination with oral anticoagulants is effective in reducing the frequency of systemic embolism in patients with prosthetic heart valve replacement but is ineffective in patients with transient cerebral ischemic attacks or for the prevention of venous thromboembolism. Hydroxychloroquine was effective in reducing postoperative venous thrombosis in patients undergoing general abdominothoracic surgery but the evidence that it was effective in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery is inconclusive. Sulphinpyrazone may be effective in reducing the frequency of sudden cardiac deaths in patients in the first year after myocardial infarction when it is started within 25 to 35 days after the infarction. Sulphinpyrazone reduced the incidence of arteriovenous shunt thrombosis in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis and in combination with anticoagulants, it reduced the frequency of recurrent venous thrombosis. There have been no large scale trials of platelet suppressant drugs in clinical cancer and successful treatment of thromboembolic disorders cannot be used to predict success in the treatment of malignant disease."

CD008691,0,20146888,0,Comparison of anti-Xa activity after a single intravenous bolus of low-dose enoxaparin in patients with and without end-stage renal disease.,"This study was designed to evaluate anti-Xa activity hourly during the first 3 h after a single intravenous bolus of 0.5 mg/kg enoxaparin in 30 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent haemodialysis, and in 30 patients with normal or mildly reduced renal function who underwent coronary angiography for chest pain (non-ESRD group). Mean +/- SD haemodialysis time was 3.9 +/- 0.3 h in the ESRD group. Of 24 patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease in the non-ESRD group, 20 underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A peak anti-Xa activity > 0.5 IU/ml 10 min after enoxaparin injection was obtained in 90% and 93% of the non-ESRD and ESRD patients, respectively. The percentages of patients with peak anti-Xa activity in the target range (0.5 - 1.5 IU/ml) were similar in the two groups (non-ESRD 80%, ESRD 93%). Adequate anti-Xa activity (> 0.5 IU/ml) lasted about 2 h in both groups. It is concluded that a single intravenous low-dose enoxaparin (0.5 mg/kg) bolus provides anti-Xa activity adequate for elective PCI within 2 h irrespective of whether or not the patient had ESRD."

CD008691,0,12649530,0,New markers of accelerated atherosclerosis in end-stage renal disease.,"Over the last two decades, several studies have reported a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This population usually presents both the traditional and non-traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis. Inflammation as well as impaired nitric oxide production are pivotal, throughout the whole process of development of atherosclerotic lesions from the very start. C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation and an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in the general population, and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase, are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease and mortality in the ESRD population. Increased CRP levels have been described in hemo-dialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, probably due to concomitant diseases, recurrent infections and chronic dialytic therapy. CRP levels, however, are elevated even in predialysis patients, implying that factors related to uremia per se can promote CRP synthesis. Recent reports raise the question whether CRP could be more than just a sensitive marker of inflammation and may contribute actively to the development of the atherosclerotic lesion. ADMA accumulation in the ESRD population is a consequence of reduced renal excretion and impaired enzymatic degradation and is related to the progression of atherosclerosis. Both CRP and ADMA have been shown to be associated with increases in the incidence and progression of atherosclerotic lesions in carotid arteries, as evaluated by high-resolution Doppler ultrasonography."
CD008691,0,10146597,0,Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for chronic dialysis patients.,"Accelerated forms of atherosclerosis continue to be responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality among patients on chronic hemodialysis, and coronary artery disease is responsible for approximately 20-30% of the deaths of such patients. The suitability of such patients for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), however, remains unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of PTCA in a group of chronic dialysis patients. PTCA was performed on a total of 15 dialysis patients with medically refractory angina pectoris. Angiographic success was obtained in 16 of 21 (76%) stenoses attempted after the first PTCA. Restenosis was observed in 6 of 16 (38%) lesions, which was significantly related to longer dialysis history (p less than 0.01), and low maximal inflation pressure (p < 0.05). Five of the 6 patients with restenosis underwent a second PTCA, however, all 4 patients with successful second PTCA developed recurrence of angina. Three of 4 patients with a second episode of restenosis underwent a third PTCA, and angina recurred in 2. Thus, PTCA is a reasonable initial strategy for patients with chronic hemodialysis, especially when dialysis history is short. For restenotic lesions and when there is a long dialysis history, restenosis rates are high and coronary bypass surgery should be considered."

CD008691,0,15514576,0,The prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.,"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or other radiocontrast procedures. Approximately 25% of all patients selected for these procedures are at risk for its development. Patients who experience this complication have higher rates of mortality, longer hospital stays and poorer long-term outcomes. The occurrence of CIN is directly related to the number of co-existing clinical risk factors. Among the many risk factors, preexisting renal impairment, advanced age, the presence of diabetes mellitus and both the volume and type of the contrast agent administered are among the most important. While the precise pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for this condition are complex and incompletely understood, experimental studies suggest that the pathogenesis involves a combination of renal ischemia and direct tubular epithelial cell toxicity. At the present time, adequate periprocedural hydration and the selection of low-osmolar and, more recently, iso-osmolar contrasts agents are the only available tools to the operator for reducing the risk of this complication. Several other modalities, such as the use of NaHCO3 and hemofiltration, also appear promising in preventing the development of this complication. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and consequences of CIN. It also reviews the risk factors for the development of CIN, as well as the history of the various modalities studied in its prevention."
CD008691,0,15996243,0,Coronary artery calcification in renal transplant recipients.,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in renal transplant recipients. Although renal transplant recipients frequently undergo cardiac functional tests prior to surgery, coronary atherosclerosis can remain undetected. Coronary artery calcification (CAC), an early marker of atherosclerosis can be quantified using EBCT. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent and characteristics of CAC at the time of renal transplantation. We evaluated 79 consecutive incident asymptomatic renal transplant recipients. Patients were mostly White (62%), male (54%) and had a deceased donor renal transplant (61%). The mean age was 47 (12.1) years. Sixty-five percentage of subjects had CAC. The mean CAC score was 331.5 (562.4) with a median of 43.3. Older age, presence of diabetes, not having a preemptive transplant, deceased donor transplantation and hypercholesterolemia were significantly associated with presence of CAC univariately. Median CAC scores were significantly increased in subjects with diabetes (127.8 vs. 28.9, p=0.05), exposed to dialysis (102.9 vs. 3.7, p<0.001) and deceased donor recipients (169.7 vs. 7.5, p=0.02). Using multiple logistic regression, age and time on dialysis were significantly associated with the presence of CAC at the time of transplant. In summary, CAC is prevalent in patients undergoing kidney transplant. CAC may be a method to identify renal transplant recipients at increased risk for future cardiovascular events."

One stage operation for aneurysm of the diverticulum of the ductus arteriosis and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is reported. A 61-year-old man was admitted for diagnosis of thoracic aneurysm on chest X-ray and CT. Chest CT scan showed an aneurysm above the left main pulmonary artery. An aortography showed the left vertebral artery originated directly from the aortic arch and a saccular aneurysm arising from the aortic isthmus and lesser curvature of the aortic arch. Coronary arteriography showed 75% stenosis at the right coronary artery (seg. #1) and 75% stenosis at the left anterior descending artery. Operation was performed through a median sternotomy. The aneurysm of 6 to 3 cm was located between the aortic isthmus and left pulmonary artery. Ascending aorta and right atrium were used to institute cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). CABG (LITA to #7, SVG to #4 PD) was performed. Arterial cannulation was then switched to the left femoral artery. The proximal aorta was cross-clamped between the left vertebral artery and the left subclavian artery under the partial CPB, and the distal aorta was occluded with a occulusive balloon catheter via the right femoral artery. The selective left axillar artery cannulation was performed to perfuse LITA. The aneurysm was resected and closed with a patch. His post-operative course was uneventful."

Diagnosis of coronary disease using Tl-201 myocardial scintigraphy after administration of dipyridamole].,"Myocardial perfusion using Tl 201 after dipyridamol was evaluated in 33 patients on maintenance hemodialysis. In addition radionuclide angiography (RNA) was performed following hemodialysis to assess left ventricular function. RNA was done at rest in 31 patients and repeated in 13 after isometric exercise. All patients studied showed no signs of congestive heart failure. 55% of the patients had abnormal Tl 201 scintigrams, whereas coronary artery disease (CAD) was underestimated from clinical symptoms alone (33%). The incidence of an abnormal Tl 201 finding increased with the duration of hemodialysis treatment. However, in the symptomatic patients angina appeared already in the first (45%) or second year of hemodialysis treatment. 39% of patients with abnormal Tl 201 findings died within a year following scintigraphic examination. From 15 patients with normal Tl 201 scans 26% died. Overall mortality rate was above that in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with CAD, averaging about 7.7% per day. The major causes of death were cardiovascular complications in patients with abnormal Tl 201 findings. In all patients left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was within the normal range following hemodialysis. Thus in our patients LVEF appeared not as an important prognostic characteristic. However, ventricular function can be impaired following exercise. As expected, in 7 patients with CAD (abnormal Tl 201 scan) isometric handgrip induced a mean decrease in LVEF by 11% and abnormalities in regional wall motion. However, also in 4 of 6 patients with normal Tl 201 scintigrams LVEF decreased following isometric exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008691,0,10232689,0,The low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype is an independent predictor for coronary artery disease in hemodialysis patients: a prospective follow-up.,"Patients with end-stage renal disease treated by hemodialysis have a tremendous risk for cardiovascular complications that cannot be explained by traditional atherosclerosis risk factors. Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), a risk factor for these complications in the general population, is significantly elevated in these patients. In this study, it was determined whether Lp(a) and/or the genetically determined apo(a) phenotype are risk predictors for the development of coronary artery disease in these patients. A cohort of 440 unselected hemodialysis patients were followed for a period of 5 yr independent of the cause of renal disease, duration of preceding treatment, and the preexistence of coronary artery disease at study entry. Coronary events defined as definite myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, aortocoronary bypass, or a stenosis >50% in the coronary angiography were the main outcome measure. Sixty-six (15%) of the 440 patients suffered a coronary event during follow-up. In univariate analysis, patients with events were significantly older and showed a trend to lower HDL cholesterol concentrations, and higher apolipoprotein B and Lp(a) concentrations without reaching significance. Apo(a) phenotypes of low molecular weight, however, were significantly more frequent in patients with compared to those without events (43.9% versus 21.9%, P<0.001). The other lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins were similar in both groups. Multiple Cox proportional hazards regression analysis found age and the apo(a) phenotype to be the best predictors for coronary events during the observation period, independent of whether patients with a preexisting coronary artery disease or an age >65 yr at the study entry or both were excluded from the analysis. Diabetes mellitus was a risk factor only in presence of a low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype. The genetically determined apo(a) phenotype is a strong and independent predictor for coronary events in hemodialysis patients. Apo(a) phenotyping might be helpful to identify hemodialysis patients at high risk for coronary artery disease."
CD008691,0,20436705,0,Correlates of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis in long-term kidney transplant patients.,"Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of early death and graft loss in renal transplant patients. The aim of this study was to identify clinical and echocardiographic parameters independently associated with the angiographically-determined severity of coronary atherosclerosis in long-term kidney transplant patients. Fifty-two kidney transplant recipients who underwent elective coronary angiography were reviewed retrospectively. Angiographic severity was evaluated using the modified Gensini index (MGI). The mean age at coronary angiography was 52.5+/-7.9 yr with a mean prior transplant duration of 118.1+/-58.8 months. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated a positive correlation of MGI with transplant duration before coronary angiography and chronic allograft nephropathy, whereas an inverse correlation was demonstrated with ejection fraction and statin use. On subsequent multivariate linear regression analysis, transplant duration before coronary angiography, statin use, and ejection fraction were independently associated with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis in long-term kidney transplant patients. In summary, our study demonstrates that statin use, ejection fraction, and transplant duration before coronary angiography are independent parameters associated with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis in long-term kidney transplant patients. Further investigation is required to reduce the atherosclerotic burden in kidney transplant patients."
CD008691,0,18721508,0,Impact of optimal medical therapy and revascularization on outcome of patients with chronic kidney disease and on dialysis who presented with acute coronary syndrome.,"Coronary artery disease is the main cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The poor prognosis associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in these patients has been related to therapeutic nihilism. This study included 2,357 patients with ACS who had percutaneous coronary intervention. According to their creatinine clearance and medical history, they were divided into 3 groups: dialysis (n = 73); CKD (n= 293); and control (n= 1,991). Rates of cardiovascular events were recorded during a 1-year follow-up period. Patients in all groups received similar contemporary therapy for ACS, including percutaneous coronary intervention and optimal medial therapy. On admission, patients with CKD and patients on dialysis more often presented with cardiogenic shock (p = 0.05 and 0.02, respectively). A graded increase in the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events at 1 year was observed with decreasing renal function (control 13%, CKD 22.9%, dialysis 45.2%, p <0.001 for all comparisons). In multivariate analysis, patients with CKD and on dialysis were significantly associated with 1-year major adverse cardiac events with adjusted hazard ratios of, respectively, 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.1; p = 0.009) and 2.7 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 4.1; p <0.001). In conclusion, despite optimal contemporary medical therapy and revascularization, the prognosis of patients with CKD and, in particular, of patients undergoing dialysis, remains poor."

In earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), vascular calcification also has been documented. This study evaluated the association between coronary artery calcification (CAC) and bone histomorphometric parameters in CKD predialysis patients assessed by multislice coronary tomography and by undecalcified bone biopsy. CAC was detected in 33 (66%) patients, and their median calcium score was 89.7 (0.4-2299.3 AU). The most frequent bone histologic alterations observed included low trabecular bone volume, increased eroded and osteoclast surfaces, and low bone-formation rate (BFR/BS). Multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes, showed that BFR/BS was independently associated with the presence of coronary calcification [p = .009; odd ratio (OR) = 0.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.036-0.619]. This study showed a high prevalence of CAC in asymptomatic predialysis CKD patients. Also, there was an independent association of low bone formation and CAC in this population. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that low bone-formation rate constitutes another nontraditional risk factor for cardiovascular disease in CKD patients."

CD008691,0,12703884,0,Relationship between diabetes mellitus and degree of coronary artery disease in uraemic patients investigated with coronary angiography.,"Prevalence of cardiovascular disease is high in diabetic patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT); therefore we examined the role of diabetes mellitus on determining the degree of coronary artery stenosis. Twenty-five patients underwent coronary angiography, 12 were awaiting kidney transplantation and the examination was performed regardless of cardiac symptoms, 13 were affected by ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Diabetic and nondiabetic status together with the other risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as age, sex, length of time on RRT, smoking and elevated phosphorus levels history, clinical diagnosis of IHD, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease, mean blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium, phosphate, albumin, haemoglobin, haematocrit and weekly dose of erythropoietin were derived from clinical records. All investigated parameters were matched in diabetic (group 1, n=10) and nondiabetic patients (group 2, n=15) and showed no differences. Clinical evidence of IHD was detected in 80% of patients in group 1 and 46% in group 2 and the percentage of patients on the renal transplant waiting list was not statistically different in the two groups (30 vs 60%). In 60% of patients in group 1 there were 3 or more stenotic lesions equal or greater than 75% of normal reference segment in the major coronary arteries, whilst in 53% in group 2 there were no haemodynamically significant narrowings. Narrowing percentage of the coronaries in group 1 and 2 were: right coronary artery 83 +/- 30 vs 32 +/- 41 (p<0.05), left anterior descending artery 80 +/- 25 vs 44 +/- 34 (p<0.05), left circumflex artery 46 +/- 37 vs 18 +/- 29 (p=0.05) respectively. Our study confirms that IHD is a clinical feature of uraemic diabetic patients and that diabetes is the main cardiovascular risk factor for determining the degree of coronary stenosis."

CD008691,0,2678807,0,Renal failure in diabetes: a substantive problem in provision of health care.,"Approximately 5.8 million people in the United States have been diagnosed by a physician as being diabetic, and an additional 4 to 5 million people have undiagnosed diabetes. Although the incidence of diabetes appears to be declining from a peak of 300 per 100,000 population in 1973, to 230 per 100,000 in 1981, its prevalence continues to rise, due to a 19 percent decline since 1970 in deaths caused by diabetes. In 1982, 34, 583 deaths were attributed to diabetes, resulting in diabetes being ranked as the seventh leading underlying cause of death. Medical and surgical complications of diabetes due to macro- and microvascular disease result in 5,800 new cases of blindness, 4,500 perinatal deaths, 40,000 lower extremity amputations and 3,000 deaths due to diabetic coma (ketotic and hyperosmolar) and at least 4,000 new cases of end-stage renal disease. Hyperglycemia is a major if not sole determinant of diabetic glomerulopathy. The exact mechanism underlying diabetic vasculopathy is under intensive study. Experiments in the induced-diabetic rat and dog suggest that small vessel injury may--under defined circumstances--be associated with the polyol (sorbitol) pathway of glucose metabolism, myoinositol deficiency, capillary hypertension, plasma hyperviscosity, stiff erythrocytes, elevated circulating thromboxane, and platelet-derived growth factor(s). As yet, no single hypothesis fits these seemingly disparate pieces together into a unified formulation of the genesis of diabetic complications. Clinical experience sustains the contention that a functioning kidney transplant proffers the uremic diabetic younger than age 60 a higher probability for survival with good rehabilitation than does either peritoneal dialysis or maintenance hemodialysis. Diabetics treated by kidney transplantation require more than the routine preoperative and postoperative attention afforded to nondiabetic ESRD patients. During initial nephrologic evaluation, concurrent extrarenal vascular disease--especially ophthalmic, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and in the extremities, often demands immediate attention. Inventory of co-morbid risk factors pre-transplant facilitates their management post-transplant, thereby improving chances for rehabilitation. Consultations with an ophthalmologist and podiatrist familiar with management of the uremic diabetic should be obtained prior to transplant surgery. When performed as a component of pre-transplant evaluation, coronary angiography permits identification and correction, in many patients, of potentially fatal coronary artery disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD008691,0,18336102,0,[Multidetector row CT in assessment of coronary artery calcification on hemodialisis].,"Vascular calcification is a strong predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Coronary artery calcification is more frequent, more extensive and progresses more rapidly in CKD than in general population. They are also considered a marker of coronary heart disease, with high prevalence and functional significance. It suggests that detection and surveillance may be worthwhile in general clinical practice. New non-invasive image techniques, like Multi-detector row CT, a type of spiral scanner, assess density and volume of calcification at multiple sites and allow quantitative scoring of vascular calcification using calcium scores analogous to those from electron-beam CT. We have assessed and quantified coronary artery calcification with 16 multidetector row CT in 44 patients on hemodialysis and their relationship with several cardiovascular risk factors. Coronary artery calcification prevalence was of 84 % with mean calcium score of 1580 +/- 2010 ( r 0-9844) with calcium score > 400 in 66% of patients. It was usually multiple, affecting more than two vessels in more than 50%. In all but one patient, left anterior descending artery was involved with higher calcium score level at right coronary artery. Advanced age, male, diabetes, smoking, more morbidity, cerebrovascular disease previous, and calcium-binders phosphate and analogous vitamin D treatment would seem to be associated with coronary artery calcification. Coronary artery calcification is very frequent and extensive, usually multiple and associated to modifiable risk factors in hemodialysis patients. Multi-detector-row CT seems an effective, suitable, readily applicable method to assess and quantify coronary artery calcification."

Four days later she became anuric. Acute thromboembolis occlusion of the renal arteries was assumed and renal angiography was performed. The angiography showed complete obstruction of the left renal artery and partial obstruction of the right renal artery. Due to the poor general condition of the patient it was not possible to carry out renovascular surgery or streptokinasetherapy. An attempt was therefore made to remove the emboli from the renal arteries by a new technique (transfemoral embolus aspiration).

CD008691,0,11679096,0,Cardiac biomarkers in the new millennium.,"Cardiac disease is the major cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), accounting for about 45% of all deaths. In dialysis patients about 20% of cardiac deaths are attributed to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The survival of dialysis patients after AMI is poor, with nearly three-quarters of patients dead at 2 years after AMI. The definition of AMI is based on symptoms, electrocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers. In the non-ESRD population, it has been recognized that sensitive markers of myocardial injury (cardiac troponin I and troponin T) define a group of patients who are increased risk for adverse cardiac outcomes and who are more likely to benefit from treatment. Elevated cardiac troponin levels in nonhospitalized ESRD patients without other evidence of ongoing myocardial ischemia may also prospectively identify a subgroup of ESRD patients at increased risk for death. This editorial is an overview of cardiac biomarkers (specifically troponin I and troponin T) in the management of acute coronary syndromes in ESRD patients.

CD008691,0,2148851,0,Effects of diabetes mellitus and aluminum toxicity on myocardial calcium transport.,"Diabetics have an increased risk of developing renal insufficiency, as well as congestive heart failure independent of coronary atherosclerotic or hypertensive heart disease. Aluminum toxicity is being recognized with increased frequency in patients with reduced renal function and aluminum accumulates to a greater degree in tissues of patients with diabetes. Studies in patients with end stage renal disease have implicated aluminum overload as a potential cause of reduced cardiac function. Since both diabetes and aluminum decrease the activity of (Ca + Mg)-ATPase, a key enzyme involved in myocardial calcium transport, the interaction of experimental diabetes mellitus and aluminum toxicity on myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transport was investigated in rats. Aluminum alone had no effect on (Ca + Mg)-ATPase activity, while activities in both the diabetic ([DM]) and diabetic plus aluminum loaded ([DM + Al]) groups were significantly lower than controls ([C]). Oxalate-dependent calcium uptake in the [DM] rats was slightly, but not significantly lower than controls, however, uptake was markedly reduced in rats which were both diabetic and aluminum loaded. The calcium regulatory protein calmodulin was measured by a functional assay in the soluble fraction of myocardial tissue prepared from each of the four groups. Compared to [C], calmodulin activity was significantly reduced in both the [DM] and [DM + Al] groups but not affected by aluminum alone. These data indicate that diabetes mellitus is associated with decreased myocardial calmodulin activity that may contribute to reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca + Mg)-ATPase and calcium transport activities and that aluminium toxicity potentiates the adverse effects of diabetes on decreasing sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake."

CD008691,0,16251246,0,Effect of lipid modification on progression of coronary calcification.,"Coronary artery calcification (CAC) reflects the anatomic presence of coronary atherosclerosis and the relative burden of coronary artery disease (CAD). Higher levels of CAC are seen in the presence of CAD risk factors, older age, and chronic kidney disease. The lipid profile (primarily low HDL cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, elevated LDL cholesterol, and elevated total cholesterol) are important factors in the calcification process. The annual progression of CAC can be reduced from 25 to 30% to 0 to 6% with LDL cholesterol reduction caused by statins and possibly sevelamer. At treated LDL cholesterol levels somewhere below 100 mg/dl, several sources of data suggest the anatomic burden of CAD, including CAC, regresses. Additional supportive studies indicate that carotid intimal medial thickness and the volume of coronary atheroma also can be reduced by LDL cholesterol reduction in concert with elevation of HDL cholesterol. This article reviews the data in support of altering the natural history of CAC with lipid modification."

In contrast, PD in patients with coronary artery disease rapidly increased only to 1 minute of exercise, with no significant subsequent increase. Expressed as a percent change from control, the response of normal subjects differs significantly from that of patients with coronary artery disease at 1 and 4 minutes of exercise, and 2 minutes of recovery. The PD increase in normal subjects from end-exercise to 2 minutes of recovery may be attributable to the heart rate decreasing faster than venous return, associated with LV ejection time, which is significantly shorter than heart rate-predicted values 2 minutes after exercise."

Comparison with intracoronary Doppler flow measurement.,"Coronary blood flow quantification provides essential information on the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery stenoses. Recently, magnetic resonance (MR) flow mapping has emerged as a new promising method to noninvasively determine flow velocity and flow volume within the coronary arteries. The aim of this study was to compare phase difference (PD) MR flow quantification with intracoronary Doppler flow measurements in 15 patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease. Flow quantification was attempted before and after systemic application of 5mg Isosorbiddinitrate (ISDN) in order to determine possible alterations in coronary flow volume. PD MR flow mapping was performed successfully in 13 of the 15 patients. For flow velocities and flow volume values, a close correlation between PD MR and Doppler flow measurements was found (r = 0.79 and r = 0.90, respectively). However, average flow measured by PD MR was significantly lower than the invasively obtained values (9.0 +/- 4.4 cm/sec vs. 11.7 +/- 4.9 cm/sec; p < 0.001 and 46.3 +/- 28.7 ml/min vs. 53.4 +/- 32.8 ml/min; p < 0.05). Although the mean flow volume remained constant in the entire patient group after ISDN application, individual changes (increase in 6, decrease in 4 cases) could be documented with PD MR imaging and showed a good correlation to the Doppler method (r = 0.82). In conclusion, PD MR flow mapping is a promising method for the noninvasive quantification of coronary blood flow and therefore offers the potential of assessing coronary artery stenoses. However, technical improvements are mandatory in order to increase accuracy of the method."
CD008691,0,19362802,0,[Coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes].,"Diabetes in patients with coronary artery disease multiplies the risk of a cardiovascular event by a factor of 2 to 3. The risk is still higher for patients with heart or kidney failure. The detection of silent ischemia makes it possible to identify patients with revascularizable stenosis of the coronary artery or three-vessel atheroma. The choice between angioplasty and coronary bypass for diabetes patients with multiple-vessel disease requires multidisciplinary discussion. The onset of acute coronary syndrome in a patient with diabetes justifies coronary angiography to attempt any possible revascularization. Coronary angioplasty with a drug-eluting stent reduces the risk of need for revascularization due to restenosis, without modifying the risk of death/infarction compared with a bare-metal stent. Prognosis is improved only if appropriate comprehensive management follows, including intensive correction of risk factors. The management of a patient with coronary artery disease and diabetes must be multidisciplinary, in a network of care coordinated by the general practitioner."

It is well known that more than a half of diabetics are hypertensive. Therefore, it is very important to treat hypertension to reduce cardiovascular events as well as end-stage renal disease. At first, life style modification such as body weight reduction, exercise and restriction of salt and alcohol intake will be recommended. Improved glycemic control by such a non-pharmacological therapy will lower blood pressure. Recent studies demonstrated that hypoglycemic agents improving insulin resistance such as metformin and troglitazone reduce blood pressure. If these maneuvers do not lower blood pressure, hypotensive medication will be necessary. As a first line therapy, ACE inhibitor, alpha 1-blocker or Ca-channel blocker will be selected. In diabetics with proteinuria or micro-albuminuria, ACE inhibitors will be effective to delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy."

Between September 1988 and March 1989, 407 patients with either suspected or already ascertained coronary artery disease underwent simultaneous assessment of regional ventricular function with first pass radionuclide angiography, and of myocardial perfusion with single photon emission computerized tomography, by means of 2 injections of 99mTc-MIBI at rest and at peak of the same exercise test. Out of these patients, 56 (52 men and 4 women, whose mean age was 57 +/- 7 years) underwent coronary angiography within 6 months of radionuclide examination and were included in the study. There were 13 1-vessel, 26 2-vessel and 17 3-vessel disease patients. Thirty-six of them had had a previous (greater than 6 months old) myocardial infarction, on the anterior wall in 16 patients, on the inferior wall in 20. In all patients a computerized bicycle stress test was performed; interruption criteria were ST segment depression greater than or equal to 1 mm in 27 patients (48%), the achievement of a heart rate greater than 85% of maximal age-predicted heart rate in 12 patients (22%) and fatigue in 17 patients (30%). Scintigraphic results were compared to angiographic findings: global sensitivity and specificity of the simultaneous evaluation were 82% and 81%, respectively, vs 95% and 56% of functional results and 85% and 71% of perfusion results, respectively. Regional analysis was also performed, by dividing scintigraphic images into the territories supplied by the 3 main coronary vessels, i.e., left anterior descending artery (LAD), left circumflex artery (LCx) and posterior descending artery (PD). On LAD territory the simultaneous evaluation achieved a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 63%, vs 98% and 38% of functional analysis and 88% and 50% of perfusional analysis, respectively. On LCx territory sensitivity and specificity were respectively 71% and 96%, vs 91% and 64% of function, and 77% and 96% of perfusion alone. On PD territory sensitivity was 85%, vs 94% and 91%, respectively; specificity was 73%, vs 55% and 55%, respectively.

However, data are limited for younger patients. We have previously reported CAC in eight of 53 children with CKD. After 2 years, CAC evaluation was repeated in 48 patients. The median CAC score (CACS) increased from 101.3 (1473.6 +/- 1978.6, range 8.5-4332) to 1759.2 (2236.4 +/- 2463.3, range 0-5858) Agatston units (AU). When the individual changes in CACS were evaluated one by one, we showed a mild decrease in two patients on hemodialysis (HD) and in one transplant (Tx) recipient, a moderate increase in one patient on HD, one on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and one Tx recipient, and a large increase in one HD patient. Also, CAC disappeared in one HD patient. All patients with no calcification at baseline remained calcification-free at follow-up. To obtain the individual cumulative exposure, we calculated time-averaged mean values, using the laboratory values from the beginning of dialysis to the first and second multidetector spiral computed tomography (MDCT) scans (baseline and final values, respectively). Final CACS was positively related to final calcium-phosphorus (CaxP) product, while CAC progression was inversely associated with final serum albumin level.

CD008691,0,1777585,0,Cardiovascular complications in renal failure.,"Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) largely as a result of the progressively increasing age of ESRD patients and the broad constellation of uremia-associated factors that can adversely affect cardiac function. Hypertension, one of the leading causes of renal failure, is a major culprit in this process, causing left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac chamber dilation, increased left ventricular wall stress, redistribution of coronary blood flow, reduced coronary artery vasodilator reserve, ischemia, myocardial fibrosis, heart failure, and arrhythmias. In addition to impairing the coronary microcirculation, hypertension may contribute to the development of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, particularly in the presence of the many lipid abnormalities observed in ESRD. These patients have reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations, and there is a defect in cholesterol transport. Other abnormalities that may contribute to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease in ESRD are reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol synthesis and reduced activity of the reverse cholesterol pathway. Treatment with fibric acids, nicotinic acids, and lovastatin may be useful in lowering cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in some of these patients. The incidence of coronary artery disease in ESRD populations is difficult to determine. About 25 to 30% of ESRD patients with angina have no evidence of significant coronary artery disease, and an undetermined number have silent coronary disease. The presence of resting electrocardiographic abnormalities caused by hypertension or conduction defects makes it difficult to accurately diagnosis coronary artery disease in ESRD populations by noninvasive methods, including exercise testing and thallium scintigraphy with or without the use of dipyridamole. Hypotension is a frequent complication of the dialytic process. Many factors have been implicated, including autonomic neuropathy. There is no consensus on the function of the efferent limb of the sympathetic nervous system. The afferent limb (arterial baroreflex function) is felt to be impaired. Further, there may be defects in the ability of the cardiovascular system to respond to sympathetic nerve activity. Most studies of autonomic function have used indirect measurements. Studies are underway that use techniques to assess sympathetic function directly. Such experiments with microneuropathy suggest greater skeletal sympathetic muscle discharge in uremic patients than in normal patients."

CD008691,0,11904814,0,Lower extremity revascularization without preoperative contrast arteriography: experience with duplex ultrasound arterial mapping in 485 cases.,"This study reviews our experience with duplex ultrasound arterial mapping (DUAM) for preoperative evaluation in 466 patients (262 men) who underwent 485 lower extremity revascularization procedures from January 1, 1998 to May 30, 2001. Preoperative imaging consisted of DUAM alone in 449 procedures and DUAM and contrast angiography (CA) in 36. An attempt to image from the distal aorta to the pedal arteries was made in all the patients. The selection of optimal inflow and outflow bypasses anastomotic sites was based on a schematic drawing following DUAM examination. Inflow disease was also assessed by intraoperative pressure gradient (IPG) between the distal anastomosis and radial arteries, and completion arteriography of the runoff vessels was obtained, which was correlated with the preoperative findings. Indications for surgery were severe claudication in 91 (19%) limbs, tissue loss in 197 (40%), rest pain in 113 (23%), acute ischemia in 46 (10%), popliteal aneurysm in 18 (4%), superficial femoral artery aneurysm in 1, abdominal aortic aneurysm with claudication in 1, and failing graft in 18 (4%). Age ranged from 30 to 97 years (mean 72 +/- 12 (SD) years) and risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, use of tobacco, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease were present in 45%, 45%, 44%, 44%, and 13% of the patients, respectively. One hundred twenty-one (25%) limbs had at least 1 previous ipsilateral revascularization. The mean DUAM time was 66 +/- 20 (SD) min (30-150 min). Additional preoperative imaging was deemed necessary in 36 cases due to extensive ulcers, edema, severe arterial wall calcification, and very poor runoff. The distal anastomosis was to the popliteal artery in 173 cases and to the tibial and pedal arteries in 255. Inflow procedures to the femoral arteries, embolectomy, thrombectomy, balloon angioplasty, and patch angioplasty accounted for the remaining 57 cases. Overall, 6-, 12-, and -24- month secondary patency rates were 86%, 80%, and 66%, respectively. This early experience shows that high-quality arterial ultrasonography performed by a highly skilled vascular technologist may represent an alternative to conventional arteriography for patients in need of lower extremity revascularization. Because of limitations inherent to the technique and very poor runoff observed on ultrasonographic examination, additional preoperative imaging procedure's are needed for certain patients."

CD008691,0,16969750,0,"Coronary artery calcification, common carotid artery intima-media thickness and aortic pulse wave velocity in patients on peritoneal dialysis.","An increasing body of evidence suggests that atherosclerosis in patients with uremia differs from that found in general population in terms of advancement and localization of vascular lesions. It has also been suggested that different non-invasive techniques of vascular system evaluation are designed to show different types of lesions (i.e. vascular calcification, stiffness or 'classical' atherosclerosis). The aim of the study was to search for possible associations between results obtained with three different non-invasive methods of vascular system assessment in three different vascular sites in patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD). 61 patients (28 F, 33 M), mean age of 50.4+/-13.6 years, on maintenance PD for a median period of 10 months (range 1-96 months) were included. Coronary artery disease (CAD) was present in 21 subjects. In all subjects coronary artery calcification score (CaSc) using multi-row spiral computed tomography (MSCT), aortic pulse wave velocity (AoPWV) and ultrasound-based common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) were performed as methods for assessing coronary calcium burden, arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis, respectively. Median value of CaSc equaled 11.5 Agatston units (range 0-5502.8 units). Median AoPWV was 10.4 m/s (range 7.56-18.1 m/s), and median CCA-IMT-0.6 mm (range 0.3-1.0 mm). In 16 patients (26.2%) at least one plaque in at least one common carotid artery was found on ultrasound. CaSc correlated with AoPWV (R=0.32, p<0.01) and with CCA-IMT (R=0.35, p<0.005), whereas no association was found between AoPWV and CCA-IMT. AoPWV, but not CaSc nor IMT correlated with blood pressure. The values of CCA-IMT and AoPWV increased together with consecutive Agatston categories (with p<0.001 for differences in AoPWV and p<0.05 for CCA-IMT). Patients with at least one plaque found in at least one CCA and patients with CAD were characterized with significantly higher values of CaSc, IMT and PWV, when compared to plaque-free and CAD- negative subjects, respectively. Association between CaSc and both IMT and PWV may suggest that the mechanism of three assessed vascular pathologies may be based, to some extent, on the process of pathologic calcium-phosphate deposition. Lack of correlation found between PWV and IMT may suggest that aortic stiffness and carotid atherosclerosis may partially differ in their pathologic background and/or are dissociated in time."
CD008691,0,10147633,1,Noninvasive assessment of cardiac risk in insulin-dependent diabetic patients being evaluated for pancreatic transplantation using thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy.,"We examined the value of thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in noninvasive assessment of cardiac risk in 36 insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetic patients being evaluated for pancreas or combined pancreas/kidney transplantation. An extensive cardiovascular evaluation including electrocardiogram was performed in all patients, and most patients were also evaluated by two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography. Exercise thallium studies were performed in 31 patients. Five patients were unable to exercise and underwent dipyridamole-thallium study. The thallium images were abnormal in 12 patients, 10 of whom underwent coronary arteriography. Significant coronary artery disease was found in 7 of these patients. Nineteen patients underwent pancreatic (3 patients) or pancreato-renal (16) transplantation without any occurrence of cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction peri-operatively or on follow-up ranging from 7 months to 21 months. In contrast, 3 cardiac events occurred in 12 patients not approved for transplantation, each of whom had an abnormal thallium study exhibiting significant ischemia. Resting left ventricular global and regional function was not helpful in determining perioperative risk. Thus, thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy may be useful in identifying diabetic patients at low risk for pancreas transplantation and may obviate the need for routine coronary angiography in these patients."

CD008691,0,18184879,0,Emerging biomarkers for evaluating cardiovascular risk in the chronic kidney disease patient: how do new pieces fit into the uremic puzzle?,"Premature cardiovascular disease (CVD), including stroke, peripheral vascular disease, sudden death, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure, is a notorious problem in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Because the presence of CVD is independently associated with kidney function decline, it appears that the relationship between CKD and CVD is reciprocal or bidirectional, and that it is this association that leads to the vicious circle contributing to premature death. As randomized, placebo-controlled trials have so far been disappointing and unable to show a survival benefit of various treatment strategies, such a lipid-lowering, increased dialysis dose and normalization of hemoglobin, the risk factor profile seems to be different in CKD compared with the general population. Indeed, seemingly paradoxical associations between traditional risk factors and cardiovascular outcome in patients with advanced CKD have complicated our efforts to identify the real cardiovascular culprits. This review focuses on the many new pieces that need to be fit into the complicated puzzle of uremic vascular disease, including persistent inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and vascular ossification. Each of these is not only highly prevalent in CKD but also more strongly linked to CVD in these patients than in the general population. However, a causal relationship between these new markers and CVD in CKD patients remains to be established. Finally, two novel disciplines, proteomics and epigenetics, will be discussed, because these tools may be helpful in the understanding of the discussed vascular risk factors."
CD008691,0,7731145,0,Clinical and echocardiographic disease in patients starting end-stage renal disease therapy.,"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have a high cardiovascular mortality rate. Precise estimates of the prevalence, risk factors and prognosis of different manifestations of cardiac disease are unavailable. In this study a prospective cohort of 433 ESRD patients was followed from the start of ESRD therapy for a mean of 41 months. Baseline clinical assessment and echocardiography were performed on all patients. The major outcome measure was death while on dialysis therapy. Clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease were highly prevalent at the start of ESRD therapy: 14% had coronary artery disease, 19% angina pectoris, 31% cardiac failure, 7% dysrhythmia and 8% peripheral vascular disease. On echocardiography 15% had systolic dysfunction, 32% left ventricular dilatation and 74% left ventricular hypertrophy. The overall median survival time was 50 months. Age, diabetes mellitus, cardiac failure, peripheral vascular disease and systolic dysfunction independently predicted death in all time frames. Coronary artery disease was associated with a worse prognosis in patients with cardiac failure at baseline. High left ventricular cavity volume and mass index were independently associated with death after two years. The independent associations of the different echocardiographic abnormalities were: systolic dysfunction-older age and coronary artery disease; left ventricular dilatation-male gender, anemia, hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia; left ventricular hypertrophy-older age, female gender, wide arterial pulse pressure, low blood urea and hypoalbuminemia. We conclude that clinical and echocardiographic cardiovascular disease are already present in a very high proportion of patients starting ESRD therapy and are independent mortality factors."

The angiography performed 30 months after operation revealed no specific changes in the kinking of RITA and in the left ventricular function. Another case was a 74-year-old man with chronic renal failure under hemodialysis. He underwent CABG with left internal thoracic artery (LITA) to LAD. Post-operatively he had chest pain during hemodialysis. On POD 10, angiography revealed that LITA had a kinking with moderate stenosis and normal left ventricular function. The angiography performed 10 months after operation revealed no specific changes in the kinking of LITA. However, left ventriculography revealed akinesis in the antero-apical region. It suggested that the viability was lost due to the graft kinking of LITA and steal phenomenon on hemodialysis."

Although cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in patients with renal failure, the process of elevation of serum troponin is not well known. Troponin T is more frequently elevated than troponin I in these patients which leads to uncertainty in the clinical interpretation of results. There are studies suggesting that troponin elevations are associated with a higher risk and increased mortality. To explain the process leading to troponin increases in this kind of pathology and to confirm its usefulness in the diagnosis, evolution and prognosis it would be necessary to carry out more clinical studies monitoring troponin and studying the stratification of risk."

CD008691,0,15601745,0,Association between chronic kidney disease and coronary artery calcification: the Dallas Heart Study.,"The hypothesis that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased coronary artery calcification (CAC) was tested using data from the Dallas Heart Study, a representative sample of Dallas County residents aged 30 to 65 yr. CKD was defined as presence of microalbuminuria and GFR > or =60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (stage 1 to 2), or GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (stage 3 to 5), excluding end-stage kidney disease. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between stages of CKD and CAC scores >10, >100, and >400 versus scores < or =10 compared with no CKD while adjusting for covariates. Analyses were repeated after stratifying by presence of diabetes. The mean age was 43.9 yr, and hypertension and diabetes were noted in 31.0 and 9.8%, respectively. No association was noted between stage 1 to 2 CKD and increased CAC scores. Compared with no CKD, stage 3 to 5 CKD was associated with CAC scores >100 (odds ratio, 2.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 8.80) and >400 (odds ratio, 8.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.94 to 35.95) in the total population after adjustment for covariates, but these associations were substantially reduced after exclusion of participants with diabetes. Participants with diabetes and stage 3 to 5 CKD had a ninefold increased odds of CAC scores >10 versus scores < or =10 compared with participants with diabetes and without CKD, whereas no association was noted between stage 3 to 5 CKD and CAC scores >10 in the nondiabetic population. In conclusion, stage 3 to 5 CKD is associated with increased CAC scores, but this association may be substantially stronger among adults with diabetes. These findings need to be confirmed in study populations that include adults >65 yr of age and a larger number of CKD cases."

CD008691,0,8461627,0,Aneurysms of coronary arteries in a patient with adult polycystic kidney disease: arteriosclerosis or involvement by the primary disease?,"Adult polycystic kidney disease is frequently associated with gastrointestinal and cardiovascular abnormalities. These include hypertension, mitral valve prolapse, mild dilation of the aortic root, abdominal aneurysms, and predisposition to aortic, mitral, and tricuspidal valve regurgitation reminiscent of Marfan's syndrome. Although the exact molecular mechanisms of adult polycystic kidney disease are not well established, a generalized defect of collagen structure is hypothesized. The most severe vascular problems, however, are typical intracranial aneurysms with a high incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage and a high mortality rate. We report a case of dilated coronary arteries found incidentally in a patient with adult polycystic kidney disease and stress-induced angina pectoris. The typical angina pectoris of the patient is explained by left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary heart disease. Multiple liver cysts, mitral valve prolapse, and the coronary aneurysms in this patient with adult polycystic kidney disease appear to reflect the manifestation of a generalized connective tissue disorder in this syndrome."

CD008691,0,1784539,0,[Effect of hemodialysis on left-ventricular contractility].,"43 patients with end-stage renal failure maintained on hemodialysis were studied by echocardiography before and after hemodialysis. Considering possibility, that left ventricule can be enlarged due to intrinsic factors impairing their performance, like myocardial fibres damage in coronary disease or inflammation and extrinsic factors like hypertension, overhydration, anemia, arteriovenous shunt and humoral changes (electrolyte imbalance, uremic toxins, acidosis) three groups of patients were chosen: A--with normal left ventricular diameter, B--with enlarged left ventricule before and after dialysis, C--with enlarged left ventricule only before dialysis. Mean velocity of circumferential fibre shortening (mVcf) and ejection fraction (EF) as left ventricular contractility indexes and end-systolic meridional wall stress as afterload index were determined. Stress-shortening relations before and after hemodialysis were compared in groups, to determine possible intrinsic contractility impairment of the left ventricule. No differences in groups were found in preload reduction (weight loss) and humoral changes (BUN, creatinine, pH, potassium, calcium, hematocrit), also blood pressure was not significantly different in all groups. Hemodialysis improved contractility only in patients with normal left ventricular diameter and significant reduction of afterload. In group A and C stress-shortening relation increased after dialysis. In group B decreased probably because of the lack of mVcf improvement despite reduction of stress in two patients. It is possible that these two patients had impaired contractility and enlarged left ventricle due to intrinsic factors."

In this 6-month study, 557 patients were randomly allocated to therapy with tacrolimus (n = 286) or cyclosporine A (n = 271) concomitantly with azathioprine and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was the incidence of and time to acute rejection. Blood pressure, serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood glucose were measured at baseline, and at months 1, 3, and 6. Ten-year risk of coronary heart disease was estimated according to the Framingham risk algorithm. Tacrolimus resulted in significantly lower summary measures (time-weighted average) of serum cholesterol (p = 0.0004) and mean arterial blood pressure (p = 0.0156), but in a higher summary measure of blood glucose (p = 0.0028) than cyclosporine. The summary measure of serum triglycerides was not different between treatment groups (p = 0.368). The mean 10-year coronary artery disease risk estimate was significantly lowered in men (p = 0.0032) treated with tacrolimus, but was unchanged in women.

CD008691,0,20970072,0,2010 guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology for the management of hypertension.,"Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for atherosclerosis-related mortality and morbidity. In this document, the Hypertension Committee of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology provides new guidelines for hypertension management. The key messages are as follows. (1) The life-time risk for hypertension is 90%. (2) Both the increase in the prevalence rate and the relative risk of hypertension for causing cardiovascular events are higher in Asians than in Caucasians. (3) The control rate has been improved significantly in Taiwan from 2.4% to 21% in men, and from 5% to 29% in women in recent years (1995-2002). (4) Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) = 130/80 mmHg are thresholds of treatment for high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, stroke, established coronary heart disease, and coronary heart disease equivalents (carotid artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm). (5) Ambulatory and home BP monitoring correlate more closely with end-organ damage and have a stronger relationship with cardiovascular events than office BP monitoring, but the feasibility of home monitoring makes it a more attractive alternative. (6) Patients with masked hypertension have higher cardiovascular risk than those with white-coat hypertension. (7) Lifestyle changes should be encouraged in all patients, and include the following six items: S-ABCDE (Salt restriction; Alcohol limitation; Body weight reduction; Cessation of smoking; Diet adaptation; Exercise adoption). (8) When pharmacological therapy is needed, physicians should consider ""PROCEED"" (Previous experience of patient; Risk factors; Organ damage; Contraindication or unfavorable conditions; Expert or doctor judgment; Expense or cost; Delivery and compliance) to decide the optimal treatment. (9) The main benefits of antihypertensive agents are derived from lowering of BP per se, and are generally independent of the drugs being used, except that certain associated cardiovascular conditions might favor certain classes of drugs. (10) There are five major classes of drugs: thiazide diuretics; β-blockers; calcium channel blockers; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs); and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Any one of these can be used as the initial treatment, except for β-blockers, which are only indicated in patients with heart failure, a history of coronary heart disease, and hyperadrenergic state. (11) A standard dose of any one of the five major classes of antihypertensive drugs can produce an ∼10-mmHg decrease in systolic BP (rule of 10) and a 5-mmHg decrease in diastolic BP (rule of 5), after placebo subtraction. (11) Combination therapy is frequently needed for optimal control of BP, and the amount of the decrease in BP by a two-drug combination is approximately the same as the sum of the decrease by each individual drug (∼20 mmHg in systolic BP and 10 mmHg in diastolic BP) if their mechanisms of action are independent, with the exception of the combination of ACEIs and ARBs. (13) An ACEI or ARB plus a calcium channel blocker or a diuretic (A + C or A + D) are reasonable two-drug combinations, and A+C + D is a reasonable three-drug combination, unless patients have special indications for β-blockers. (14) Single-pill (fixed-dose) combinations that contain more than one drug in a single tablet are highly recommended because they reduce pill burden and cost, and improve compliance. (15) Very elderly patients (> 80 years) should be treated without delay, but BP should be reduced gradually and more cautiously. Finally, these guidelines are not mandatory; the responsible physician's decision remains most important in hypertension management."

Coronary heart disease was revealed in 64 patients: stenoses of 50-70% in 28, 71-90% in 16, over 90% in 20 patients. For stenoses above 50% the sensitivity of clinical symptoms was 0.52, their specificity 0.64. For stenoses over 70% the specificity was 0.58; over 90% it was 0.70. Typical symptoms of angina were less common in dialysis patients with coronary heart disease than is usual in other patients with coronary heart disease. Total duration of dialysis as well as frequency and severity of coronary heart disease did not correlate. In 19 of the 100 patients valvar disease was also present, with a discrepancy between the severity of clinical and of hemodynamic findings. Incidence and severity of valvar disease increased with the duration of dialysis. Transplantation was postponed in 11 patients (bypass operation in 3, balloon dilatation in 2, valve replacement in 6). Transplantation was advised against in four (severe coronary heart disease in 2, cardiomyopathy in 2)."

CD008691,0,1751258,0,"Ischemic heart disease, serum cholesterol, and apolipoproteins in CAPD.","Thirty-one patients, mean age 54 years, had been on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for an average of 38 months. Mean values (mg/dl) for triglycerides (567), total-C (267), LDL-C (133), and Apo-B (154) were elevated, and HDL-C (30) were low. The low values for total-C/Apo-B and LDL-C/Apo-B suggest an increase in the number of low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, rather than in the amount of cholesterol per LDL particle. Without knowledge of lipids, ischemic heart disease for the 31 patients was categorized into five grades in the following manner. All patients were graded based on history (angina, myocardial infarction, and bypass surgery), electrocardiogram (EKG), and echocardiography. In addition, five patients underwent coronary angiography, the results of which were considered in their grading. The five grades were assigned as follows: Grade I, no evidence (n = 15); Grade II, angina with EKG ischemia (n = 4); Grade III, myocardial infarction (MI) (n = 1); Grade IV, MI with dyskinesia-akinesia on echo (n = 4); Grade V, severe three vessel disease on angiography, or multiple infarcts, or Grade IV with heart failure (n = 7). Only Apo-B (r = 0.56) and total-C/HDL-C (r = 0.57) correlated with severity of grade, with p less than 0.001. When patients with and without detectable ischemic heart disease were compared by stepwise logistic regression, Apo-B was the only variable that independently predicted heart disease (p = 0.001). However, contribution of the lipid changes induced by CAPD has not been established."
CD008691,0,8709414,0,[Angiographic study of stenosis and calcification of coronary vessels in long-term dialysis patients: examination of risk factors for coronary calcification].,"Coronary atherosclerosis and calcification score were assessed angiographically in 30 uremic patients receiving dialysis (8 patients with diabetes mellitus [DM dialysis group] and 22 patients without DM [non-DM dialysis group] who were suspected of having coronary artery disease because of their clinical symptoms and electrocardiographic findings. Thirty non-uremic subjects (11 with DM and 19 without DM) served as controls. Twelve dialysis patients (40%) did not have significant coronary artery disease, and the rate of significant coronary artery disease in dialysis patients overall was less than that in the control subjects. The calcification score of dialysis patients was significantly higher than that of the control patients (P < 0.0001), and also scores of the non-DM dialysis group and the DM dialysis group were higher than those of each group of control subjects. The scores were significantly correlated with the duration of dialysis in uremic patients as a group (r = 0.52; P < 0.01) and the non-DM dialysis group (r = 0.70; P < 0.01), but were not correlated with the duration of dialysis in the DM dialysis group. The scores were correlated with serum phosphate concentration, but not with serum calcium concentration, calcium phosphate product, alkaline phosphatase levels total cholesterol or age. Calcification scores were extremely high (> 21) in six uremic patients who had high serum c-terminal parathyroid hormone concentrations. These findings indicate that serum phosphate concentration, serum c-terminal parathyroid hormone concentration, and the duration of dialysis are closely associated with coronary calcification in long-term dialysis patients."

We therefore evaluated whether the presence of MS is associated with more coronary lesions and a worse cardiac outcome in end-stage renal disease patients with acute coronary syndrome."
CD008691,0,18328840,0,"Impact of renal insufficiency on angiographic, procedural, and in-hospital outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention.","Patients with chronic renal insufficiency (RI) have higher in-hospital mortality and major adverse cardiac event (MACE) rates after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The mechanisms of this adverse course are not well understood. It was hypothesized that this worse outcome may be caused by inadequate PCI results secondary to more complex coronary anatomy in patients with RI. Baseline, procedural, and outcome variables of all PCI cases at the University Health Network are entered prospectively in the PCI Registry. All PCI cases between April 1, 2000, and October 31, 2005, excluding patients in shock, who had preprocedural creatinine clearance (CrCl) measured were included in this study (n = 10,821 of 11,023 patients). Moderate RI (CrCl <60 ml/min) was evaluated as an independent predictor of procedural outcomes, death, and MACE (defined as death, myocardial infarction, abrupt closure, or coronary artery bypass grafting). Moderate RI (CrCl <60 ml/min) independently predicted the procedural outcomes of worse residual stenosis >20% (p = 0.03), number of undeliverable stents (p = 0.003), and smallest stent diameter (p <0.001). Worst residual stenosis >20% and any undeliverable stent were significantly associated with in-hospital MACEs (odds ratio [OR] 3.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0 to 5.3, p <0.001 and OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.9, p = 0.002) and mortality (OR 3.82, 95% CI 2.2 to 6.7, p <0.001 and OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.6 to 5.9, p = 0.002). These risks were independent of all other measured variables. In conclusion, moderate to severe RI was a strong predictor of worse procedural results during PCI, which, in turn, were independent predictors of in-hospital MACE and mortality and independent contributors to the higher risk of in-hospital adverse events observed after PCI in patients with RI."

There was no clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of ischemic coronary artery disease in twenty. Ten patients (five males, five females, mean age 29.3 years; mean duration of diabetes 21.9 years; mean serum cholesterol 239 mg%) had significant coronary artery disease, seven demonstrating focal abnormalities in left ventricular wall motion. Two patients (one male, one female; mean age 36.5 years; mean duration of diabetes 28.5 years; mean serum cholesterol 250 mg%) had no significant coronary artery disease, but demonstrated diffusely abnormal left ventricular wall motion with diminished ejection fraction. Thirty-eight percent had significant coronary artery disease unpredictable by electrocardiographic or clinical data.

CD008691,0,18328846,0,A comparison of contemporary definitions of contrast nephropathy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and a proposal for a novel nephropathy grading system.,"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has multiple definitions. We attempted to identify the optimal definition of CIN. In 985 patients undergoing PCI (derivation group), we assessed the prognostic significance of 4 commonly used contemporary definitions of CIN (increases in serum creatinine after PCI [deltaCr] >1.0 mg/dl, >0.5 mg/dl, and >25% after PCI; and the American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Data Registry definition) with respect to 6-month major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and all-cause mortality (at 863 +/- 324 days). Incidence of CIN ranged widely (2.0% to 15%) depending on the definition used. Only 2 definitions (deltaCr >0.5 mg/dl, >25%) consistently correlated with study outcomes. Using these 2 definitions, we devised a new grading system (grade 0 deltaCr <or=25% and <or=0.5 mg/dl; grade 1 deltaCr >25% but <or=0.5 mg/dl; and grade 2 deltaCr >0.5 mg/dl). Nephropathy grades (0 vs 1 vs 2) showed significant correlation with 6-month MACEs (12.4 vs 19.4 vs 28.6%, p = 0.003) and all-cause mortality (10.2 vs 10.4 vs 40.9%, p <0.0001). In multivariate analyses, the grading system showed an independent association with MACEs and mortality. The prognostic value of nephropathy grades was prospectively confirmed in an independent validation group of 539 patients. In conclusion, of the 4 contemporary definitions of CIN, only deltaCr >25% and >0.5 mg/dl consistently predicted adverse events after PCI. By unifying these 2 definitions, we devised a novel nephropathy grading system that is predictive of 6-month MACEs and all-cause mortality after PCI."
CD008691,0,17070422,0,Frequency of coronary artery disease in patients with renal artery stenosis without clinical manifestations of coronary insufficiency.,"Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) arise from the same multiple risk factors. The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency of previously undiagnosed CAD in patients with angiographically confirmed RAS, by conducting coronary arteriography in the same setting. Of 57 consecutive patients referred for renal arteriography on clinical grounds during a 14-month period, 28 had no RAS and 6 had RAS, but previously documented CAD. Of the remainder 23 patients, 17 (74%; CI 56%-92%) had both RAS and CAD (7 single vessel, 4 two-vessel, and 7 multivessel disease). The clinical characteristics, such as age, blood pressure (BP) levels, signs of heart failure, were no different between those with and without CAD, although the 4 diabetic patients, the 4 patients with fundoscopic findings of grade III retinopathy, 11 of 14 with peripheral arterial disease, and 7 of 8 patients with prior stroke belonged in the CAD group. None developed complications as a result of the two consecutive procedures. The data suggest that in patients with RAS the frequency of silent CAD is high and cannot be predicted on clinical grounds alone, therefore coronary angiography should be routinely recommended in the same setting."

CD008691,0,15365955,0,Percutaneous coronary intervention in chronic kidney disease patients.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The increased prevalence of CVD in patients with renal dysfunction has been attributed to lack of effective prevention and low utilization of effective therapy. The optimal treatment of ischemic heart disease in ESRD patients before renal transplantation is controversial. Although no meta-analysis or pooled analysis of the data from small trials exists, it appears that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) provides excellent angiographic success but is associated with increased restenosis and the need for revascularization and that coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), while associated with higher in-hospital morbidity and mortality, provides better overall long-term results and freedom from angina. Despite suboptimal results for percutaneous interventions in comparison with bypass surgery, PCI remains a viable option, especially for patients who are not candidates for surgery and those with disabling angina despite anti-anginal therapy. Regardless of the revascularization strategy used, outcomes of CABG or PCI in these patients are significantly worse than outcomes in the general population. The long-term benefit after revascularization and adjunctive medical therapy should be an area of intense future research. Studies should also be conducted to investigate the benefit and safety of therapies such as the long-term use of beta-blockers, statins, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis inhibition in patients with CKD."

In order to identify patients with high risk for life-threatening complications, reliable prognostic markers would be helpful. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) has been shown to predict cardiovascular events and death in patients with stable coronary artery disease as well as in acute coronary syndrome in patients with normal renal function.

CD008691,0,16955104,0,Correlation of simple imaging tests and coronary artery calcium measured by computed tomography in hemodialysis patients.,"Vascular calcification is associated with an adverse prognosis in end-stage renal disease. It can be accurately quantitated with computed tomography but simple in-office techniques may provide equally useful information. Accordingly we compared the results obtained with simple non-invasive techniques with those obtained using electron beam tomography (EBT) for coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) in 140 prevalent hemodialysis patients. All patients underwent EBT imaging, a lateral X-ray of the lumbar abdominal aorta, an echocardiogram, and measurement of pulse pressure (PP). Calcification of the abdominal aorta was semiquantitatively estimated with a score (Xr-score) of 0-24 divided into tertiles, echocardiograms were graded as 0-2 for absence or presence of calcification of the mitral and aortic valve and PP was divided in quartiles. The CACS was elevated (mean 910+/-1657, median 220). The sensitivity and specificity for CACS > or = 100 was 53 and 70%, for calcification of either valve and 67 and 91%, respectively, for Xr-score > or = 7. The area under the curve for CACS > or = 100 associated with valve calcification and Xr-score was 0.62 and 0.78, respectively. The likelihood ratio (95% confidence interval) of CACS > or = 100 was 1.79 (1.09, 2.96) for calcification of either valve and 7.50 (2.89, 19.5) for participants with an Xr-score > or = 7. In contrast, no association was present between PP and CACS. In conclusion, simple measures of cardiovascular calcification showed a very good correlation with more sophisticated measurements obtained with EBT. These methodologies may prove very useful for in-office imaging to guide further therapeutic choices in hemodialysis patients."
CD008691,0,20503025,0,Gross proteinuria and subacute renal failure after coronary angiography - a case report of cholesterol crystal embolization.,"We report on a 55-year-old man who was admitted with increased serum-creatinine (3.4 mg/dl), gross proteinuria (4.6 g/24 h) and arterial hypertension. The medical history included hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease (CAD) and a recent coronary angiography, but normal serum-creatinine and no proteinuria before coronary intervention. Serology and urinary analysis did not show any signs of a systemic disease. A renal biopsy, however, revealed multiple cholesterol crystal emboli in small vessels along with a typical infiltration of eosinophilic granulocytes. The patient was subsequently treated with an angiotensin-receptor-1 (AT1R) blocker and high-dose statins and was then evaluated for LDL-apheresis. Gross proteinuria was largely unaffected by (AT1R) blockade and renal function further declined necessitating, initiation of hemodialysis. Renal CCE with profound proteinuria is an unusual presentation of acute renal failure, potentially misleading and thereby prolonging correct diagnostics of a rare entity. Identification of high-risk patients is of utmost importance as efficient therapeutic strategies do not exist."

Coronary arteriography, dipyridamole SPECT thallium imaging and clinical follow-up were performed in all patients. Nineteen patients (42%) had an obstruction of 50% or more in at least one coronary artery. Fourteen patients had a positive thallium scan, but 7 of these were false-positives (sensitivity 37%, specificity 73%). The sensitivity was considerably lower than that quoted for non-ESRF patients in the literature, and significantly lower than a control group of 19 patients without ESRF having comparable severity and distribution of CAD. Five of the 6 patients who died of cardiac causes over a mean follow-up period of 25 months had normal thallium imaging, but all had significant coronary artery disease at cardiac catheterization. Dipyridamole SPECT thallium imaging has not proved a useful screening test for angiographically significant CAD, and does not predict cardiac prognosis in this population."
CD008691,0,20347648,0,Translating associations between common kidney diseases and genetic variation into the clinic.,"Studies of the genetics of common diseases have revealed multiple risk alleles associated with end-stage renal disease, albuminuria, serum creatinine, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and increased triglyceride levels. These associations have prompted further basic science research, which has led to the discovery of novel pathways and a better understanding of the pathophysiology of common diseases. Currently, the ability to translate these discoveries into clinical practice is limited by the small effect size of these risk alleles and a lack of studies showing meaningful impact of genetic variation on risk assessment and clinical outcomes. Advances in genetic testing will continue to yield highly significant associations but translation into clinical practice will require effective collaboration between physicians and basic and social scientists. Rigorous clinical trials eventually will reveal which combination of genetic tests improves risk stratification and identifies individuals most likely to benefit from specific prevention strategies and therapies."
CD008691,0,3382298,0,Congestive heart failure in dialysis patients.,"To determine the prevalence of congestive heart failure in dialysis patients and the disorders with which it is associated, 85% of 153 nondiabetic patients who were undergoing maintenance dialysis had echocardiography and gated cardiac scan. Ten percent (n = 15) had congestive heart failure, 53% (n = 8) of whom had dilated cardiomyopathy, and 47% (n = 7) had hypertrophic hyperkinetic cardiomyopathy. Ischemic heart disease was an additional independent risk factor for congestive heart failure. Significantly more of those patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were smokers and none were hypertensive, whereas all those patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were hypertensive. The prevalence of hypertrophic hyperkinetic disease was 11%, of dilated cardiomyopathy 18%, and of symptomatic ischemic heart disease 18%. We concluded that congestive heart failure in dialysis patients is associated not only with dilated cardiomyopathy but also with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a disease that requires echocardiography for diagnosis and that has different risk factors and management."
CD008691,0,6355509,0,Improved results of cadaver renal transplantation in the diabetic patient.,"The results of 54 renal transplants performed on 48 patients with end stage renal disease and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus are reported. Pre-transplant screening with coronary angiography was done to determine the presence and severity of coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. There were 12 living related donor (group 1) and 42 cadaver renal transplants. The cadaver transplant recipients were grouped further into those who received additional prophylactic immunosuppression with antilymphoblast globulin (group 2, 18 patients) and those who received standard immunosuppression with azathioprine and prednisone (group 3, 18 patients). The 2-year patient and graft survival rates in groups 1 to 3 were 81 and 67, 88 and 69, and 61 and 32 per cent, respectively. The use of prophylactic antilymphoblast globulin for adjunctive immunosuppression resulted in significantly improved graft survival among cadaver recipients (p less than 0.003). Selection of patients for transplantation on the basis of preliminary screening with coronary angiography was found to have a major impact on patient survival."

CD008691,0,16821026,0,Coronary artery calcifications in children with end-stage renal disease.,"Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common in adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but little is known about the prevalence and the extent of it in children. We used multidetector spiral computed tomography (MDCT), echocardiography, and carotid and brachial high-resolution ultrasonography to screen for the presence and predisposing factors of CAC in 53 children with ESRD [15 hemodialysis (HD) patients, 24 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, and 14 renal transplant (rTx) recipients]. CAC was present in 15% of patients (three HD patients, three PD patients, and two rTx). The mean age of the patients with CAC was 16.4 years (range: 11.0-21.2 years), and their median CAC score was 101.3, ranging from 8.5 to 4,322 according to the Agatston method. The patients with CAC had longer duration of total dialysis (P=0.005), had higher time-integrated serum phosphorus (P<0.001), calcium-phosphate (CaxP) product (P=0.012), intact parathyroid hormone (P=0.010), vitamin B(12) levels (P=0.010), the amount of cumulative calcium-containing oral phosphate binders (OBPs) (P<0.001), and calcitriol intake (P<0.001), and had lower serum hemoglobin level (P=0.014). Interventricular septum systolic thickness (P=0.033) was significantly higher, relative wall thickness (P=0.062) tended to be higher, and flow-mediated endothelium-dependent dilatations (P=0.071) were lower without reaching statistically significant levels in those with CAC. A stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that serum phosphorus (P=0.018) and the cumulative exposure to calcium-containing OPBs (P=0.016) were the most significant independent predictors in the development of CAC. These results indicate that even adolescents and children with ESRD may have coronary calcifications. We concluded that impaired divalent ion metabolism is the main factor in the formation of CAC in this age group."
CD008691,0,18847418,0,[Clinical advances in vascular calcification].,"The articles providing answers to the questions on vascular calcification of most interest from a clinical point of view were selected. 1. How is it measured?: Studies showing the clinical utility of different tools to quantify it were analyzed. 2. What does it measure?: Both in dialysis patients and the general population, vascular calcification and arterial stiffness are prognostic factors for morbidity and mortality. Other markers such as fetuin-A are associated with mortality in patients on hemodialysis but not in patients in early stages of chronic kidney disease. 3. What causes it?: In two selected studies, it was demonstrated again that low bone turnover and diabetes cause cardiovascular disease and vascular calcification, respectively. 4. How is it treated?: There is still no clinical evidence of regression of vascular calcification. However, a prospective study in new hemodialysis patients showed that sevelamer compared to calcium compounds slows the progression of vascular calcification and confers greater survival. A study comparing both compounds in chronic hemodialysis patients showed that sevelamer only had a benefit on survival in patients older than 65 years. It remains to be demonstrated whether the good experimental results of paricalcitol and cinacalcet are confirmed in prospective clinical studies."
CD008691,0,9134832,0,[The effect of coronary intervention on renal function in patients with chronic renal failure].,"To investigate the effect of coronary intervention on renal function in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) we investigated 19 patients with CRF [serum creatinine (Scr) > 1.5 mg/dl] who underwent coronary intervention for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina recruited from 516 consecutive patients admitted to the coronary care unit of Nara Medical University Hospital from January, 1992 to July, 1995. Serum creatinine levels were measured at 3 points: on admission, at peak level, and at discharge. Nineteen patients were divided into two groups on the basis of increases in Scr (delta Scr): a worsened group (group A) (delta Scr > or = 1mg/dl after coronary intervention; 6 patients) and an unchanged group (group B) (delta Scr < 1 mg/dl ; 13 patients). In group A, except for one patient, the renal function recovered to the level before coronary intervention after adequate hydration or hemodialysis. The volume of contrast medium in group A (420 +/- 134 ml) was significantly higher than group B (253 +/- 97 ml) (p < 0.01). There was significant positive correlation (r = 0.42, p < 0.05) between delta Scr and the volume of contrast medium. In conclusion, coronary intervention for patients with CRF can be performed safely under treatment with adequate hydration and hemodialysis, even at higher serum creatinine levels of up to 4.0 mg/ml."

CD008691,0,14697941,0,"Plasma tissue-type plasminogen activator, fibrinogen, and time on dialysis prior to transplantation are related to carotid intima media thickness in renal transplant recipients.","The majority of deaths among patients after renal transplantation is attributed to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Intima media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery is related to coronary and cerebrovascular arterial disease. One of the major causes of death due to CVD is acute coronary syndrome, which is precipitated by coronary plaque rupture and subsequent thrombosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate associations between some fibrinolytic factors: antigens of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), and IMT in a population of renal transplant recipients. The study was performed on 33 Caucasian, clinically stable kidney transplant recipients (11 women, mean age 43 years, range 26 to 62 years). All the patients were on triple immunosuppressive regimen (cyclosporine, prednisone, and azathioprine) and had stable graft function (serum creatinine 1.7 +/- 0.7 mg/dL). The mean time since transplantation was 49.9 months (range 4.1 to 131.8 months). In univariate analysis IMT correlated significantly with age (r =.5; P =.001), pulse pressure (PP) (r =.4; P =.05), time on dialysis prior to transplantation (r =.6; P =.001), fibrinogen (r =.4; P =.02), and t-PA (r =.6; P =.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that t-PA antigen concentration (P =.001), fibrinogen (P <.05), and time on dialysis prior to transplantation (P <.05) were positive independent predictors of IMT. These data support the concept of the coincidence of disturbances in fibrinolysis and arterial remodelling in patients after kidney transplantation. On the other hand the study shows that the duration of dialysis therapy before transplantation is detrimental to the arterial vasculature."

CD008691,0,2525871,0,Role of anemia in the pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy in end-stage renal disease.,"Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is common in end-stage renal disease, yet the factors associated with its development are poorly understood. LV mass index was determined by echocardiography in 78 patients who had been treated by dialysis for at least 3 months. A significant relation was evident between anemia and LV hypertrophy. The mean LV mass index was 158 +/- 6 g/m2 (mean +/- standard error) in patients in the lowest quartile of serum hemoglobin and 140 +/- 10, 132 +/- 7 and 120 +/- 8 g/m2 in the second, third and uppermost quartiles, respectively (p = 0.005). This relation persisted after adjusting for systolic blood pressure, treatment mode and suspected coronary artery disease. Forty-eight patients had paired studies. In these, LV mass index increased as hemoglobin decreased (coefficient = -0.81 g/m2/g/liter, p less than 0.025). These data indicate that anemia contributes to the development of LV hypertrophy in patients with end-stage renal disease."
CD008691,0,8314645,0,Observations of angina and myocardial infarction in constrictive pericarditis.,"The common symptoms of constrictive pericarditis, i.e. dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath and cough, relate to impairment of ventricular filling and to a progressive rise in systemic and pulmonary venous pressures. Myocardial ischemia, angina and myocardial infarction are rarely associated with this disease. We have encountered two patients with constrictive pericarditis, one presenting with angina and the other with acute anterior wall infarction. Possible etiologies of constrictive pericarditis in the first case include cardiac surgery, chronic renal failure and myocarditis; in the second case, Crohn's disease. The proposed mechanism of chest pain in the first patient was a reduced cardiac output resulting in underperfusion of the coronary arteries, although it is possible that the patient experienced angina due to the presence of severe coronary artery disease. In the second patient an anterior wall infarction and post-infarction angina were attributed to obliteration of the left anterior descending artery by constraint of a thickened pericardium. In both cases non-invasive imaging modalities were not of use in establishing the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. Clinical awareness and accurate hemodynamic measurements continue to play a key role in the diagnostic process."

CD008691,0,12913060,1,Coronary angiography is the best predictor of events in renal transplant candidates compared with noninvasive testing.,"Guidelines for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) and assess of risk in renal transplant candidates are based on the results of noninvasive testing, according to data originated in the nonuremic population. We evaluated prospectively the accuracy of 2 noninvasive tests and risk stratification in detecting CAD (>or=70% obstruction) and assessing cardiac risk by using coronary angiography (CA). One hundred twenty-six renal transplant candidates who were classified as at moderate (>or=50 years) or high (diabetes, extracardiac atherosclerosis, or clinical coronary artery disease) coronary risk underwent myocardial scintigraphy (SPECT), dobutamine stress echocardiography, and CA and were followed for 6 to 48 months. The prevalence of CAD was 42%. The sensitivities and negative predictive values for the 2 noninvasive tests and risk stratification were <75%. After 6 to 48 months, there were 18 cardiac events, 9 fatal. Risk stratification (P=0.007) and CA (P=0.0002) predicted the crude probability of surviving free of cardiac events. The probability of event-free survival at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months were 98%, 98%, 94%, 94%, and 94% in patients with <70% stenosis on CA and 97%, 87%, 61%, 56%, and 54% in patients with >or=70% stenosis. Multivariate analysis showed that the sole predictor of cardiac events was critical coronary lesions (P=0.003). Coronary angiography may still be necessary for detecting CAD and determining cardiac risk in renal transplant candidates. The data suggest that current algorithms based on noninvasive testing in this population should be revised."
CD008691,0,12731367,0,[Hyperhomocysteinemia and advancement of atherosclerosis in patients with chronic renal failure on maintenance hemodialysis].,"Cardiovascular diseases connected with atherosclerosis are the main factor of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a known and independent risk factor of atherosclerosis, occurring in 85-95% patients treated with hemodialysis. The aim of this study was to analyse relation between plasma level of homocysteine and chosen indicators of atherosclerosis development and also examined retrospectively cardiovascular complications in these patients. The study was carried out in 100 patients on hemodialysis who were divided into two groups: 72 patients with mild (20.74 mumol/l +/- 3.75) and 28 patients with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia (38.81 mumol/l +/- 9.81). Ultrasonographic examinations of Carotid Communis Artery Intima-Media Thickness (IMT), Ankle-Arm Blood Pressure Index (AABPI), echocardiographic parameters and biochemical examinations such as: PTH, folic acid and Vitamin B12, total protein, albumin, fibrinogen, glucose, total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, transferring, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein (a), sodium potassium, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, iron, ferritin, urea, creatinine, uric acid and value of Hb, Ht, total iron binding capacity and transferring saturation, were performed. Patients with hypertension were divided into groups according to the number of taken anti-hypertensive drugs. Hyperhomocysteinemia was confirmed in 96% of patients. Frequency and type of acute cardiovascular complications were not related with the level of hyperhomocysteinemia. Statistically significant difference between IMT and level of hyperhomocysteinemia was observed. In patients with mild hyperhomocysteinemia IMT was 0.68 mm +/- 0.24 whereas in patients with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia 0.80 mm +/- 0.25, p < 0.036). Positive correlation between level of homocysteine and IMT (r = 0.22, p < 0.03) was noted. Based on this study, we concluded, that measurement of intima-media thickness is a good indicator of atherosclerosis development and correlates with hyperhomocysteinemia in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. It clearly confirms the role of hyperhomocysteinemia as significant risk factor of atherosclerosis in those patients."

CD008691,0,17941465,0,[Influence of microinflammation and oxidative stress on atherosclerosis progression and calcifications in cardiovascular system of hemodialyzed patients during two years follow-up].,"Atherosclerosis and calcifications in the cardio-vascular system are the most frequent causes of increased morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease treated with hemodialyses. The aim of this study was to estimate the atherosclerosis progression and presence of calcifications in the circulatory system in patients treated with hemodialyses using, non-invasive imaging diagnostic techniques and to search for the relationships between these changes and microinflammation and oxidative stress during two years. The study was performed in 73 patients (36 female and 37 male), aged 25 to 75 years (mean -49.5), treated with hemodialyses, 3 times/week for 12 to 275 months (mean -73.8). In each patient before starting hemodialysis levels of: ox-LDL, Lp (a), procalcitonin, IL-1beta, IL-6, CRP, TGFbeta, TNFalpha, PDGF, AOPP and MPO were determined. Presence of artery calcifications was detected by Multi-Row Spiral Computed Tomography (MSCT) and expressed as coronary artery calcification score (CACS). Ultrasonography was used to evaluate CCA-IMT. During the study CACS increased significantly after 12 and 24 months (p < 0.00001) as compare with baseline. After 12 months, CACS increase significantly correlated with procalcitonin level (r = 0.30 p = 0.01) and after 24 months with CRP (r = 0.46; p = 0.0002) and IL-6 (r = 0.36; p = 0.005). Independent factor of coronary artery calcification progression after 24 months of observation was only CRP (beta = 0.569). CCA-IMT increased during the study and this increase was statistically significant (p < 0.00001). CCA-IMT increase correlated with CACS growth after 12 (r = 0.36; p = 0.003) and 24 months (r = 0.39; p = 0.002). After 12 months significant relationship was noted with procalcitonin (r = 0.29; p = 0.022). After 24 months CCA-IMT correlated with AOPP (r = -0.30; p = 0.017). The independent factor of CCA-IMT progression after 24 months of observation was only CACS (delta CACS beta = 0.49). From the performed study, we can conclude that exacerbation of atherosclerosis and calcification in the circulatory system of patients treated with maintenance hemodialyses depends on microinflammation and oxidative stress. Reasonable tools for diagnostic algorithm estimation of atherosclerosis advancement in this group of patients are non-invasive, visual diagnostic techniques such as MSCT and ultrasonography."
CD008691,0,8808221,0,Effect of treatment with 1.25 and 1.75 mmol/l calcium dialysate on bone mineral density in haemodialysis patients.,"The effect of two different dialysate solutions with a calcium concentration of 1.25 and 1.75 mmol/l was evaluated in 14 patients, using a cross-over design. Patients were treated with each solution during a period of 6 months. Treatment with calcium supplements, vitamin D and aluminium hydroxide was adapted weekly, according to the results of blood chemistry. PTH, SAP, and ionized calcium were determined monthly, bone density with DXA and QCT before and after 6 months of treatment. During treatment with both 1.25 and 1.75 calcium dialysate (cad), the control of serum calcium and phosphate was similar. PTH did not change during either treatment. SAP decreased during treatment with 1.75, but remained stable with 1.25 mmol/l cad. Bone density evaluated with DXA remained unchanged during both treatments. QCT measured bone density increased from 101.29 +/- 13.50 to 106.79 +/- 13.14 mg/ml in the 1.75 cad group, while it did not vary in the 1.25 cad group, (107.75 +/- 13.48 versus 108.97 +/- 13.40 mg/ml). It is concluded that lowering the calcium content of the dialysate does not negatively influence the control of serum calcium and phosphate, nor does it aggravate hyperparathyroidism when vitamin D is administered simultaneously. Under the present conditions, osteopenia and possibly bone mineralization improve only in the group dialysed with 1.75 Ca."

CD008691,0,6351648,1,Predictive value of thallium stress testing for coronary and cardiovascular events in uremic diabetic patients before renal transplantation.,"Coronary artery disease and the ability of noninvasive exercise perfusion imaging with thallium-201 to predict future coronary and cardiovascular events was prospectively evaluated in a group of 85 insulin-dependent diabetic renal transplantation candidates. Sixty patients received renal allografts (36 living related donors, 24 cadaver donors) after a thallium stress test; the actuarial 2 year patient survival rate after transplantation was 84 percent. Twenty-five patients remained on dialysis, and the 2 year actuarial survival rate from onset of dialysis was 41 percent, significantly lower than the actuarial survival rate of transplanted patients (p less than 0.01). Thirteen transplanted patients had positive thallium stress test results, and 6 (46 percent) had cardiovascular events (two fatal). In contrast, of 47 transplant patients with negative thallium stress test results, only 13 (28 percent) had cardiovascular events (four fatal). Five patients treated by hemodialysis only had positive test results and three (60 percent) had cardiovascular events (two fatal), whereas of 20 hemodialysis patients with negative test results, 9 (45 percent) suffered cardiovascular events (four fatal). In this study, cardiovascular events included arrhythmia, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. Within the total group, 4 of 18 patients (22 percent) with a positive test result (22 percent) had a fatal myocardial infarction, whereas only 3 of 67 patients (4 percent) with a negative result had a fatal myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05). In comparison, 24 of 85 patients had a history or electrocardiographic evidence of preexisting cardiovascular disease, and 13 (54 percent) had subsequent cardiovascular events (5 of 11 patients with positive test results and 8 of 13 patients with negative results). In summary, renal transplant candidates with positive thallium stress test results appear to be at increased risk compared with those with negative results for the development of fatal myocardial infarction, but thallium stress testing is no more predictive for future coronary and cardiovascular events than is a history or an abnormal electrocardiogram."

CD008691,0,12641882,0,Management of heart failure and coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major contributor to the mortality and morbidity of patients who suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD). Heart failure and ischemic heart disease (IHD) are both highly prevalent in this population. The diagnosis of myocardial dysfunction is usually based on echocardiography. As in the general population, systolic dysfunction is treated with a combination of diuretics, renin-angiotensin system blockade, and beta-receptor antagonists. Diastolic dysfunction is best managed by eliminating the cause. Non-invasive tests for coronary artery disease (CAD) may be less reliable in patients with renal disease compared with nonuremic patients. Medical therapy of IHD in this population is generally similar to that for other patient groups, but surgical revascularization appears to carry a higher risk of complications with poorer clinical outcomes. The choice of revascularization procedure (coronary artery bypass grafting versus percutaneous transluminal angioplasty) should be based on the specific coronary anatomy of a given patient as well as a consideration of other comorbid factors."
CD008691,0,17275470,0,Early coronary calcification in children and young adults with end-stage renal disease.,"Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children and young adults with end-stage renal disease. In our study, we retrospectively analyzed the records of 11 patients who had undergone electron beam computerized tomography in our dialysis unit. Our patients, aged 11 to 24 years (median, 19.3 years) were on dialysis or had functioning grafts. Coronary calcification was observed in seven patients (64%) with a mean calcium score of 273.8 +/- 708 (range 0.8 to 1864) in our study population. We compared clinical characteristics like age, gender, duration of end-stage renal disease, time on hemodialysis, body mass index, and blood pressures between the patients with calcifications (group I) and those with out calcification (group II). We also compared the laboratory data including daily calcium and calcitriol intake, lipid profile, serum calcium and phosphorus levels, calcium/phosphorus products, and serum parathyroid hormone levels in the both groups. The mean daily dose of total calcium, triglyceride level, and calcium/phosphorus products were higher in the calcification group though not statistically significant. The mean daily dose of calcitriol was significantly higher in patients with calcification. Using Spearman multivariate correlation, we found a correlation between the coronary calcium scores and mean daily doses of total calcium and calcitriol (r = .750, P =.008 and r = .869, P = .001, respectively). We conclude that coronary calcification, which is a proven predictor of cardiovascular disease, begins at a very early age and that daily doses of elemental calcium and calcitriol seem to be important factors in our study population."
CD008691,0,1843504,0,[Transesophageal Doppler echocardiographic imaging and blood flow measurements for the diagnosis of stenotic left coronary arteries].,"To evaluate the usefulness of transesophageal Doppler echocardiography (TEE) in diagnosing left coronary artery (LCA) stenosis, we studied 26 patients with 33 proximal LCA lesions, including 5 with lesions of the left main trunk (LMT), 21 proximal anterior descending arteries (LAD), 7 proximal circumflex arteries (LCx), and 20 with normal coronary arteries. We measured blood flow velocity along the LCA using the pulsed Doppler mode (PD) and obtained velocities at multiple neighboring sites in 13 normal coronary arteries and in 12 of 26 LMTs or LADs with lesions. In all 13 normals, peak velocity tended to decline towards the periphery. By contrast, in one LMT and 10 LADs with lesions, marked increase in peak velocity (1.7 to 3.9 times) was observed at the sites diagnosed as stenotic lesions by coronary angiography. Using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), 24 LMTs including 3 with lesions, 4 LADs including 3 with lesions and 13 LCxs including 4 with lesions were imaged. Among them, 3 LMT, one LAD and 2 LCx lesions were correctly diagnosed. The diagnostic ratio by both PD and 2DE was 60% for LMT (PD: 20%, 2DE: 60%), 48% for LAD (PD: 48%, 2DE: 5%) and 29% for LCx (PD: 0%, 2DE: 29%) lesions. In conclusion, TEE proved to be useful in diagnosing proximal LCA stenosis. The coronary flow measurement by PD especially has the potentiality for the diagnosis of proximal LAD stenosis."

CD008691,0,17805238,0,The progression of coronary artery calcification in predialysis patients on calcium carbonate or sevelamer.,"Coronary artery calcification is more prevalent in dialysis patients than in patients without kidney disease and this is associated with high serum phosphorus. In this study, we evaluate the effect of calcium carbonate or sevelamer treatments on the progression of calcification in 90 predialysis patients. Inclusion criteria were stable serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and a similar baseline total calcium score (TCS). These patients were not treated by phosphate binder, vitamin D, or statin. They were given low-phosphorus diets without or with daily calcium carbonate or sevelamer throughout the study that averaged 2 years. Baseline demographic or clinical characteristics along with biochemical parameters were not different among the three groups. The TCS significantly increased in patients on the low-phosphorus diet alone, to a lesser extent in calcium carbonate-treated patients, and not at all in sevelamer-treated patients. The progression of coronary calcification paralleled that of the calcium score. Our study shows that sevelamer treatment should not be restricted to dialysis patients; however, a larger study should be undertaken to confirm these results."
CD008691,0,19238868,0,Sirolimus-loaded polyurethane graft for hemodialysis access in sheep.,"Intimal hyperplasia is the most common final pathway for hemoaccess occlusion in dialysis patients. Drug eluting stents have been shown to decrease intimal hyperplasia in coronary arteries and possibly in peripheral arteries. We evaluated the use of a sirolimus loaded polyurethane graft as prophylaxis in hemodialysis access. Grafts were loaded with sirolimus and elution curves were determined for the polyurethane material. The arteriovenous grafts were then placed in the neck of 20 sheep. A non-loaded graft was placed in the contralateral neck. Patency rates, ultrasound evaluation, angiography and histomorphometry were determined for each graft. At 30, 60 and 90 days the drug loaded graft had improved patency rates compared to the control, with a 25% improvement noted at 3 months. Life table analysis showed the drug loaded graft consistently better patency than the control (p=.136). The control graft had greater neointimal stenosis (14.5% vs. 9.17%) over the course of the study (p=.157). Although none of these findings was statistically significant in this pilot study, the sirolimus coated graft out-performed the control in every measured parameter at each time point evaluated. Further work to asses the validity of drug coated materials to prevent intimal hyperplasia in hemodialysis access is warranted."

Current algorithms used to analyze wall motion usually neglect motion asynchrony that is found in acute ischemia. Fourier phase imaging of echocardiographic images may offer the possibility to detect asynchrony, but its feasibility with dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is undefined. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the extent of left ventricular asynergy can be used to quantify the severity of regional myocardial dysfunction and to detect functionally significant coronary artery stenoses during DSE."

Fifty SLE or SS female patients with cardiac symptom/sign such as chest discomfort and/or dyspnea and/or occasionally palpitation and 50 SLE or SS female patients without any cardiac symptom/sign were investigated using Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT during rest and stress after dipyridamole infusion. Twenty-five age- and sex-matched healthy females were also included as controls in this study. The results of Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT were classified into four types including normal, persistent perfusion defect (PD), reversible perfusion defect (RD), and reverse perfusion defect (RR). The results of Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT in the 25 healthy females were normal. Perfusion abnormalities were detected in 44/50 (88%) symptomatic SLE or SS patients. However, myocardial perfusion abnormalities were only detected in 19/50 (38%) asymptomatic SLE or SS patients (P value<0.05 by a chi2 test). However, for risk factor of coronary artery disease and abnormal resting EKG, the incidences were not significant between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (P values >0.05 by a chi2 test). Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT is a useful noninvasive imaging modality to detect cardiac involvement in symptomatic or asymptomatic SLE or SS patients."
CD008691,0,19625469,0,Is the aortic valve pathology type different for early and late mortality in concomitant aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass surgery?,"We assessed the effects of aortic valve pathology type on the long-term outcomes of patients who underwent concomitant aortic valve replacement (AVR) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. We retrospectively reviewed 150 patients who underwent AVR-CABG at our institution between January 1997 and December 2006. We divided patients into aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation (AR), and mixed-type groups consisting of 98 (65.3%), 20 (13.3%) and 32 (21.3%) patients, respectively. The AS group had more female patients, a higher mean angina class, older mean patient age, increased history of previous myocardial infarction (MI), and smaller valve size compared to other groups. No significant differences were observed among groups in the operative mortality for five or ten-year survival rates. Significant early mortality risk factors included cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) time, number of blood transfusion units, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), inotropic drugs, and pacemaker use. Significant late mortality risk factors included intensive care unit (ICU) stay, IABP, stroke, and dialysis. The aortic valve pathology type in patients undergoing concomitant AVR-CABG does not adversely affect survival."

CD008691,0,17697816,0,Intravascular ultrasound parameters associated with stent thrombosis after drug-eluting stent deployment.,"Drug-eluting stent (DES) thrombosis (ST) can be devastating. The study aim was to evaluate intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) predictors for DES thrombosis by comparing IVUS studies after implantation in 13 patients with 14 DES thrombosis lesions with a group of controls (30 lesions in 27 patients) matched for history of chronic renal failure and type of DES. Five patients (38%) discontinued dual antiplatelet therapy at the time of ST. There were 3 in-stent restenosis lesions (21%) treated using DESs in the ST group compared with 0 in the control group (p <0.05). Compared with the control group, IVUS studies in the ST group showed a smaller minimum stent area (4.6 +/- 1.1 vs 5.6 +/- 1.7 mm(2), p = 0.0489). In the ST group, 11 of 14 stents had a minimum stent area < or =5.0 mm(2) compared with 12 of 30 in the control group (p = 0.0392). Minimum stent area in patients who stopped clopidogrel therapy and developed ST (5.30 +/- 1.15 mm(2)) tended to be larger compared with that in patients who developed ST while using clopidogrel (4.24 +/- 0.96 mm(2), p = 0.091). Within the 5-mm-long proximal and distal reference segments analyzed, the ST group had larger proximal reference maximum plaque burdens and smaller minimum lumen areas, along with a tendency toward similar findings in the distal reference segments. In conclusion, IVUS findings at the time of DES implantation in patients who subsequently developed ST showed a smaller minimum stent area (especially in patients who developed ST while using clopidogrel) and more residual disease at the stent edges."
CD008691,0,11431183,0,Significant association between the progression of coronary artery calcification and dyslipidemia in patients on chronic hemodialysis.,"Quantification of coronary artery calcification (CAC) determined by electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT), known as the CAC score (CACS), correlates with total plaque amount and coronary risk factors and strongly associates with maximal stenosis in the epicardial arteries. However, data are limited concerning the CACS in chronic dialysis patients, although atherosclerotic vascular disease is the most frequent complication. We examined the relation between coronary risk factors, metabolic factors of calcium and other minerals, and CACS progression in 24 dialysis patients. The mean patient age was 53 +/- 14 (SD) years, and mean duration of dialysis was 64 +/- 69 months. In each patient, the CACS was measured twice, with a mean interscan period of 17 +/- 3 months. The mean CACS progressed from 449 +/- 605 to 669 +/- 894 overall, and the mean change in CACS (DeltaCACS) was 220 +/- 78. Patients were divided into two groups: slow progressors, with DeltaCACS of 7.5 +/- 31 (n = 12), and rapid progressors, with DeltaCACS of 432 +/- 458 (n = 12). Triglyceride concentrations (198 +/- 65 versus 103 +/- 50 mg/dL; P < 0.001) were high, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations (46 +/- 11 versus 60 +/- 18 mg/dL; P < 0.05) were low in rapid progressors. Rapid progression of CAC was associated with high triglyceride and low HDL-C concentrations. The clinical significance of these observations remains to be determined."
CD008691,0,17699360,0,Risk factors for cardiovascular disease in children and young adults after renal transplantation.,"Despite good outcomes in pediatric renal transplantation, life expectancy is reduced, mostly as a result of accelerated atherosclerosis. A comprehensive evaluation of cardiac status and risk factors for cardiovascular disease was performed in 60 patients after renal transplantation (age 3 to 29 yr; mean 15.8). Posttransplantation diabetes was diagnosed in 7%. Half of the patients did not engage in any physical activity, and this was associated with increased body mass index. Uncontrolled hypertension was found in 13% of patient, and 53% were on antihypertensive medications. BP index was associated with left ventricular mass index (LVMI). Dyslipidemia was relatively uncommon, with hypercholesterolemia found in 15% and elevated LDL cholesterol found in 10% of patients. Hyperhomocysteinemia was frequent (58%); in most patients, it was not due to folate or B(12) deficiency. Lipid and homocysteine abnormalities were associated with cyclosporine therapy. Echocardiography demonstrated normal LVMI in 93% of patients, although LVMI was higher than in healthy control subjects. Cardiac troponin I was normal in all patients, but N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was elevated in 35% and was associated with LVMI and renal function. Although present cardiac status is relatively normal in pediatric renal transplantation patients, cardiac risk factors are common, and strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease need to be developed."

CD008691,0,10433703,0,Divalent metal derivatives of the hamster dihydroorotase domain.,"Dihydroorotase (DHOase, EC 3.5.2.3) is a zinc enzyme that catalyzes the reversible cyclization of N-carbamyl-L-aspartate to L-dihydroorotate in the third reaction of the de novo pathway for biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. The recombinant hamster DHOase domain from the trifunctional protein, CAD, was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The DHOase domain contained one bound zinc atom at the active site which was removed by dialysis against the chelator, pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate, at pH 6.0. The apoenzyme was reconstituted with different divalent cations at pH 7.4. Co(II)-, Zn(II)-, Mn(II)-, and Cd(II)-substituted DHOases had enzymic activity, but replacement with Ni(2+), Cu(2+), Mg(2+), or Ca(2+) ions did not restore activity. Atomic absorption spectroscopy showed binding of one Co(II), Zn(II), Mn(II), Cd(II), Ni(II), or Cu(II) to the enzyme, while Mg(II) and Ca(II) were not bound. The maximal enzymic activities of the active, reconstituted DHOases were in the following order: Co(II) --> Zn(II) --> Mn(II) --> Cd(II). These metal substitutions had major effects upon values for V(max); effects upon the corresponding K(m) values were less pronounced. The pK(a) values of the Co(II)-, Mn(II)-, and Cd(II)-substituted enzymes derived from pH-rate profiles are similar to that of Zn(II)-DHOase, indicating that the derived pK(a) value of 6.56 obtained for Zn-DHOase is not due to ionization of an enzyme-metal aquo complex, but probably a histidine residue at the active site. The visible spectrum of Co(II)-substituted DHOase exhibits maxima at 520 and 570 nm with molar extinction coefficients of 195 and 210 M(-1) cm(-1), consistent with pentacoordination of Co(II) at the active site. The spectra at high and low pH are different, suggesting that the environment of the metal binding site is different at these pHs where the reverse and forward reactions, respectively, are favored."
CD008691,0,16581337,0,Benefit versus risk in statin treatment.,"The Statin Safety Assessment Conference of the National Lipid Association (NLA), reported in this supplement to The American Journal of Cardiology, provides a comprehensive evaluation of old and new experience on adverse events associated with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins. To place these in context, one can express both the risk of side effects and the benefits for cardiovascular disease in terms of events per person-year of statin treatment. The mortality risk from fatal rhabdomyolysis is approximately 0.3 per 100,000 person-years, and the risks of nonfatal rhabdomyolysis and of putative statin-attributable peripheral neuropathy are approximately 3 and 12 events, respectively, per 100,000 person-years. Reports of acute liver failure and acute or chronic kidney disease give lower rate estimates that, even when corrected for underreporting, are approximately equal to the background rates of these conditions in the general population, lending scant support for statin-attributable etiology. In contrast, the benefit of statin use is to avert several hundred deaths and several hundred cases each of heart and brain infarction per 100,000 person-years in appropriately treated high-risk patients. Although population estimates such as these are useful, they must be translated repeatedly to individual patient-provider encounters, where clinical skill and art must combine with scientific evidence. The continued publication of individual case reports and small randomized trials among groups of patients with potential side effects should be encouraged. Statins should not be used in situations where minimal benefit is expected, as safety data and risk-benefit analysis must be meshed with guidelines that help the clinician decide whom to treat and how aggressively to treat."

CD008691,0,16298258,0,Heart disease in diabetic patients.,"Cardiac artery disease and heart failure are major causes for morbidity and mortality in diabetes in general and in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in particular. Hypertension and dyslipidemia are more common in diabetes and the prevalence of coronary artery disease in diabetics is two-fold to four-fold higher than in nondiabetics. In those with CKD the incidence of cardiovascular complications is nearly two-fold higher than those without CKD. Recent studies suggest that the pathophysiology of cardiac disease is complex process involving both microvascular and macrovascular disease. In addition, myocardial lipotoxicity may be a novel contributing factor particularly in type 2 diabetics. Compelling evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials indicates that treatment with drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system are cardioprotective in diabetics with microalbuminuria and early stages of kidney disease. Multiple risk factor intervention aimed at optimal blood pressure control (BP <130/<80 mmHG), lowering LDL cholesterol below 100 mg/dl, lowering triglyceride level to 150 mg/dl, A1C <6.5%, treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker, administration of once daily low-dose aspirin and smoking cessation together reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetics. Novel studies including diabetics with nephropathy aimed at improving outcomes in diabetics by treatment of anemia and optimal control of dyslipidemia are now underway. These and other clinical trials should provide important new insights into improving the quality of life in diabetics and ultimately preventing cardiac disease."
CD008691,0,17354579,0,Possible predictors of target lesion revascularization after drug-eluting stent implantation.,A small number of patients still need target lesion revascularization (TLR) after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. It is important for the management of coronary artery disease to assess the predictors of TLR after DES implantation.
CD008691,0,2014921,1,Assessment of coronary artery disease by thallium scan in type-1 diabetic uremic patients awaiting combined pancreas and renal transplantation.,"Twenty-five type-1 diabetic uremic patients (14 men, 11 women, mean age forty +/- eleven years, range, nineteen to sixty) were prospectively analyzed for coronary artery disease (CAD) by thallium scan (TLS) before synchronus pancreas and kidney transplantation. Duration of diabetes ranged from ten to thirty-two years (mean twenty-two +/- five). Fifteen patients (60%) were in dialysis from two to sixty months (mean twenty +/- eighteen). Advanced diabetic degenerative complications were present in all patients. Twenty exercise and five pharmacologic thallium scans were performed. Forty-four percent of patients (6 men, 5 women, mean age forty-two +/- eleven years, range, twenty-six to sixty) had a positive (reversible or permanent defects) TLS. In 2/11 cases, severe CAD required further cardiac investigations for therapeutic management decision. A statistical correlation with resting ECG nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities was observed (p less than 0.05) despite the absence of angor in 8 of the 11 patients. On the contrary, no statistical correlations were found regarding high blood pressure, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, duration of diabetes, and duration of dialysis. In this particular diabetic population (young age, male/female ratio = 1.2) with high incidence of silent ischemia, resting ECG repolarization abnormalities, though predictive, were not specific or prognostic of CAD severity; in these cases, exercise and pharmacologic TLS, a noninvasive and sensitive cardiovascular test, may be of great interest in diagnosis of CAD, allowing adequate cardiac management before, during, and after pancreas transplantation."

CD008691,0,10659582,0,[Characteristics of myocardial ischemia in patients with chronic renal failure and its relation to cardiac sympathetic activity].,"In order to clarify the characteristics of myocardial ischemia in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), we performed exercise stress myocardial perfusion imaging with 99mTc-MIBI in 36 patients with CRF. In 18 patients myocardial imaging with 123I-MIBG (MIBG) and 201Tl was performed at rest to evaluate myocardial sympathetic activities: cardiac uptake of MIBG normalized by myocardial perfusion (Uptake Ratio, UR) and myocardial washout rate of MIBG (WO). Exercise-induced perfusion abnormality was observed in 25 patients, and coronary angiography was performed in 19 of them. Among 25 diseased coronary arteries, 18 developed perfusion abnormalities in the myocardial segments which were supplied by each coronary artery. However in 5 patients without coronary artery stenosis and 2 patients with left anterior descending coronary artery disease, transient perfusion abnormalities were observed in the inferior segments. In 6 of them, MIBG imaging was obtained (Group A). MIBG imaging was also performed in 5 patients with transient inferior perfusion abnormality with coronary artery stenosis which supplied the inferior wall (Group B), and 7 patients without perfusion abnormality (Group C). In the patients of Group B, inferior UR was significantly lower than in Group C (0.58 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.68 +/- 0.08, p = 0.0485) and inferior WO was more accelerated than in Group C (18.6 +/- 7.7 vs. 12.1 +/- 6.0%, NS). However anterior UR and Wo levels were identical with those in Group C. In Group A, inferior UR (0.43 +/- 0.05) was significantly lower than in Group B and C, and WO in Group A (27.2 +/- 8.3%) was accelerated significantly compared to that in Group C. Besides in Group A, anterior UR was significantly smaller and WO was greater than in Group B and C. These findings suggested that in some patients with CRF, myocardial ischemia could arise without coronary artery stenosis, and this phenomenon might be related to abnormalities of cardiac sympathetic activity."

CD008691,0,19692998,0,Incidence and progression of coronary calcification in chronic kidney disease: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.,"We studied the incidence and progression of coronary artery calcification in people with early chronic kidney disease. We used a cohort of 562 adult patients with chronic kidney disease who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), in a community-based study of people without clinical cardiovascular disease, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. The majority had stage 3 disease. Coronary artery calcification was measured at baseline and again approximately 1.6 or 3.2 years later. The prevalence of coronary artery calcification at baseline was 66%, and its adjusted prevalence was 24% lower in African Americans as compared to Caucasians. The incidence of coronary artery calcification was 6.1% per year in women and 14.8% in men. Coronary artery calcification progressed in approximately 17% of subjects per year across all subgroups, and diabetes was associated with a 65% greater adjusted risk of progression. Male gender and diabetes were the only factors associated with adjusted coronary artery calcification incidence and progression, respectively. Our study shows that coronary artery calcification is common in people with stage 3 disease, progresses rapidly, and may contribute to cardiovascular risk."
CD008691,0,10470472,0,Short- and long-term outcomes after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in chronic hemodialysis patients.,"The aim of this study was to obtain data on the outcomes of chronic hemodialysis patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). A retrospective chart analysis identified 31 such patients between August 1992 and October 1996. The mean follow-up period was 12.4 +/- 11.7 months. Angiographic success was achieved in 39 of 41 (95.1%) stenoses attempted. There were three in-hospital deaths. Clinical success was achieved in 28 of 31 patients (90%). Two of the 28 survivors were lost to follow-up. Recurrent angina developed within 6 months in 14 of 26 patients (53.8%). Eleven and 17 of the 26 patients (42.3% and 65.4%) died within 6 and 14 months, respectively, after the PTCA procedure. Ten of the 17 deaths (58.8%) were due to cardiovascular events. Our study suggests that PTCA is technically feasible with high angiographic success rate in chronic hemodialysis patients. In-hospital mortality rate and rate of recurrent angina are high. Long-term prognosis is poor."
CD008691,0,10843246,0,Cardiac arrhythmias and silent myocardial ischemia during hemodialysis.,"Cardiac arrhythmias are noted in a significant proportion of chronic renal failure (CRF) patients on hemodialysis (HD), and may contribute to cardiovascular mortality. A number of factors have been implicated in the genesis of these arrhythmias. The role of silent myocardial ischemia (SMI), however, has not been evaluated systematically. We prospectively studied 38 unselected CRF patients on regular HD by continuous Holter monitoring starting 24 hours before HD, lasting through the dialysis session and continued for 20 hours thereafter. The recordings were analyzed for frequency, timing and severity of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and SMI as identified by ST-segment depression. Ventricular arrhythmias during HD were noted in 11 (29%) patients (group I), and were potentially life-threatening (Lown Class III and IVa) in 13%. The remaining 27 patients (group II) had no ventricular arrhythmias during HD. There was no difference in the age, sex ratio, duration of HD, blood pressure, fluctuations in weight, hematocrit, predialysis creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium or inorganic phosphate levels between patients in the two groups. The number of patients with clinical ischemic heart disease was significantly greater in group I. SMI was noted in 72% and 33% of group I and II patients respectively (p = 0.026). 46% of those with and 25% of those without ST changes during HD developed ventricular arrhythmias during HD. Both SMI and ventricular arrhythmias were noted most frequently during the last hour of dialysis. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease were observed more frequently amongst patients with SMI. Ventricular arrhythmias are detected in a significant proportion of CRF patients on HD. These are probably related to coronary artery disease since silent myocardial ischemia is also noted more frequently during HD in these patients. Further studies incorporating coronary angiography are needed in a larger number of patients to establish a definite causal relationship."

In coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction and in heart failure it causes a typical nitrate action on the central hemodynamics, but due to a complete systemic availability with high and predictable systemic drug levels, a drug action with a lower interindividual variability than with ISDN is to be expected. There is a close correlation between serum level and effect. The antianginal exercise tolerance increasing and unwanted effects as well as the development of tolerance to the drug action are comparable with those of ISDN. This naturally long-acting metabolite in ISDN works usually with a standard dosage of 20 mg twice daily."
CD008691,0,12070108,0,Mild renal insufficiency is associated with angiographic coronary artery disease in women.,"Mild renal insufficiency is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events in women with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the relationship between mild renal insufficiency and atherosclerotic CAD in women is not known. Methods and Results- Women with chest pain who were referred for coronary angiography in the NHLBI Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) study underwent quantitative coronary angiography, blood measurements of creatinine, lipids, and homocysteine, and assessment of CAD risk factors. Fifty-six women had mild renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 1.2 to 1.9 mg/dL), and 728 had normal renal function (creatinine <1.2 mg/dL). Creatinine correlated with angiographic CAD severity score (r=0.11, P<0.004) and maximum coronary artery stenosis (r=0.11, P<0.003). Compared with women with normal renal function, those with mild renal insufficiency were more likely to have significant angiographic CAD (>/=50% diameter stenosis in >/=1 coronary artery) (61% versus 37%; P<0.001) and CAD in multiple vessels (P<0.001 for association) and had greater maximum percent diameter coronary stenosis (59+/-35% versus 38+/-36%; P<0.001). Mild renal insufficiency was associated with significant angiographic CAD independent of age and risk factors (OR=1.9, 95%CI=1.1 to 3.5). After controlling for homocysteine in 509 women, mild renal insufficiency remained predictive of CAD (OR=3.2, 95%CI=1.4 to 7.2)."

Another group consisted of 28 men with renal failure. Those with coronary heart disease had a significantly higher oestradiol concentration than the control group. This increased value also was present in patients with renal failure. There was a relationship between the level of oestradiol on one hand and glucose tolerance, ratio of beta to alpha-lipoproteins and blood pressure, on the other, in both the patients with coronary heart disease and the healthy controls. These results indicate the oestradiol may in males be an indicator of a risk constellation of vascular damage. Perhaps, it may be the cause of an abnormal carbohydrate and fat metabolism, which then leads to hypertension and degenerative vascular lesions."

CD008691,0,8546139,0,Carotid artery lesions in patients with nondiabetic chronic renal failure.,"Atherosclerotic complications are the leading cause of death in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients. Therefore, we wished to investigate the prevalence of carotid artery lesions (CALs) in these subjects. Two groups were evaluated by high-resolution echo Doppler: group 1 included 103 patients (68 males and 35 females) affected by nonnephrotic CRF and group 2 included 100 control subjects (60 males and 40 females). The prevalence of hypertension was 84% in both groups. The exclusion criteria included diabetes mellitus and symptoms of cerebrovascular disease. In the two groups we evaluated clinical history, physical examination, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fibrinogen, blood cell counts, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, 24-hour proteinuria, and urine analysis. In group 1 patients the following lipid profile parameters were also evaluated: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), ApoAI, ApoAII, and ApoB. Group 1 had higher triglycerides and fibrinogen than group 2. A lower body mass index was found in group 1 than in group 2. The prevalence of CALs was significantly higher in the CRF patients than in the control subjects (62% v 47%; P = 0.04). The difference between the two groups was more striking among normotensive patients (62% v 19%; P = 0.03). All CRF patients affected by peripheral arterial disease and 86% of those having coronary artery disease had associated CALs. In CRF patients the severity of CALs was positively correlated to age, white blood cell count, triglycerides, and fibrinogen. Nondiabetic CRF patients have a higher prevalence of carotid artery lesions than control subjects. Several factors besides hypertension, including lipids, blood coagulation, and leukocytes, could contribute to the accelerated atherosclerosis of CRF patients."
CD008691,0,6979796,0,New perspectives on coronary artery disease in hemodialysis patients.,"Between July 1, 1979, and July 1, 1980, we treated 64 patients with long-term maintenance hemodialysis. Of these, 11 (17%) had angina pectoris, four of them (6%) chronic stable angina and seven (11%) new onset of crescendo angina. The most common risk factors in the group with unstable angina were cardiomegaly and hypertension. Of the five patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, proximal occlusive disease was seen in four and these four had good left ventricular function. Three patients underwent coronary artery bypass, which successfully improved their functional status to a class I or II without any antianginal medicines. Concurrent hemodialysis was performed during heart-lung bypass in one patient. The need for dialysis postoperatively was easily delayed for 72 hours without detriment to this patient. We reached the following conclusions: (1) The prevalence of angina in a stable hemodialysis population was 17% in a one-year analysis period. (2) The incidence of new onset of crescendo angina, which potentially requires coronary angiography, was 11% over the same one-year period. (3) The presence of surgically correctable lesions in these cases is high. (4) Concurrent hemodialysis during coronary artery bypass simplifies postoperative fluid and electrolyte management and prevents surgical bleeding."

CD008691,0,10970980,0,Detection of cardiac calcinosis in hemodialysis patients by whole-body scintigraphy with 99m-technetium methylene diphosphonate.,"A noninvasive method for the diagnosis of cardiac calcinosis, a life-threatening complication in hemodialysis patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), has not, as yet, been firmly established. We tested whether whole body scanning with 99m-technetium methylene diphosphonate (MDP) might visualize cardiac calcinosis. In 19 consecutive chronic hemodialysis ESRD patients (13 males and 6 females, aged 40-81, mean 63 +/- 8 years) with cardiovascular disease [mitral annular calcinosis and/or calcified aortic valve (n = 4), hemodialysis cardiomyopathy (n = 1), coronary artery disease (n = 9) and peripheral artery atherosclerotic disease (n = 6)], MDP uptake in the heart was compared to that in 7 non-ESRD controls with hyperparathyroidism due to adenoma. Cardiac and lung field MDP uptake was confirmed in only 3 (16%) and 5 (26%) of the 19 ESRD subjects, respectively, but was absent in controls. Positive cardiac uptake was related to cardiac calcified complications (mobile intracardiac calcinosis, myocardial calcinosis and mitral annular calcification) and the duration of hemodialysis (p = 0.015). While it was statistically insignificant, subjects showing MDP uptake were elder and had higher serum Ca or Ca x P product and lower intact parathyroid hormone levels. These results suggest that cardiac calcinosis in ESRD patients can be detected noninvasively by myocardial scintigraphy with 99m-technetium MDP."

CD008691,0,9567039,0,[Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass for ischemic heart disease associated with preoperative severe complications].,"Our experiences of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) were reported with review of literatures. Patient #1 was a 69 years-old man with left main lesion associated with cerebral infarction and impaired renal function. Preoperative CT examination showed calcified ascending aorta. There was no significant lesions in the large right coronary artery and the circumflex was small. The patient underwent MIDCAB via minithoracotomy on the fourth intercostal space with left internal thoracic artery (ITA) to left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient was weaned from ventilator 3 hours after the operation and his postoperative course was uneventful. Patient #2 was a 80 years-old man with acute myocardial infarction requiring intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP) due to significant stenosis in the right coronary artery and left main lesion associated with chronic hemodialysis due to renal failure. The right coronary artery was dilated by balloon angioplasty at the time of emergency coronary angiogram. However, the emergent operation was required because of the left main lesion. The circumflex was relatively small and because of severe complication, MIDCAB was selected to improve his condition. He underwent MIDCAB via minithoracotomy. The heart was enlarged because of congestive heart failure and left inferior epigastric artery was used to extend the length of the left ITA. The composite graft of ITA and IEA was anastomosed to the LAD under beating heart. The IABP was removed 8 hours after the operation and his postoperative course was uneventful. The MIDCAB for coronary artery bypass was first reported by Benetti et al in 1995 and the procedure seemed to be very effective for preventing postoperative complications in selected patients as seen in ours."

CD008691,0,2108635,0,[So-called uremic heart diseases].,"The overall cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic renal failure is about 30 per cent of which 10 per cent is attributed to myocardial infarction. This prevalence led some workers to propose a hypothesis of ""accelerated atherosclerosis"" due to the hyperlipidaemia observed in 30 to 70 per cent of patients. However, the concept of accelerated atherosclerosis, which was based essentially on clinical studies, has been questioned. Pericardial effusion is a common complication of chronic renal failure and has been reported in over 62 per cent of patients in echocardiographic studies. There are many causes and symptoms are often mild; systematic echocardiographic examination of patients with renal failure undergoing haemodialysis has shown 32 per cent of pericardial effusions to be asymptomatic. There are two potential complications: cardiac tamponade and, lesser frequently, constrictive pericarditis. Cardiac failure is a common cause of death in patients undergoing long-term dialysis. The myocardial histological appearances are those of fibrosis, the etiology of which is not fully understood although the dialysis membranes and hypotensive episodes occurring during haemodialysis have been thought to play a role. Left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis may give rise to ventricular arrhythmias which could explain some of the cases of sudden death observed in patients with renal failure and often wrongly attributed to ischemic heart disease. Another form of myocardial disease which is observed later is characterised by an alteration of systolic function with left ventricular dilatation and hypokinesia and increased end diastolic pressures without an increase in left ventricular wall thickness. Valvular heart disease may also result from renal failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008691,0,17365908,0,Evaluation of the heart and great vessel calcification by conventional computed tomography in hemodialysis patients.,"Heart diseases are responsible for death in hemodialysis patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether we can assess the degree of calcification of the heart and great vessels in hemodialysis patients by non-gated conventional computed tomography (CT) without contrast media. Thirty patients were included in the present study. The hemodialysis group comprised 15 patients and the age-matched control group comprised 15 patients without hemodialysis or cardiac diseases who underwent CT scanning. Axial cross-sectional images were taken from the aortic arch to the diaphragm to detect calcification of the aorta and coronary arteries. Eleven patients in the hemodialysis group showed calcification in 1.9 +/- 1.4 coronary vessels, a frequency significantly greater than that of the 0.3 +/- 0.2 coronary vessels in the control group (p < 0.01). Fourteen patients in the hemodialysis group showed calcification of the aorta with a mean score 9.7 +/- 7.2, significantly greater than mean score in the control group (3.5 +/- 2.2; p < 0.01). These results suggest that we can assess an increase in the incidence of calcification of the coronary arteries and the aorta by conventional CT scanning without contrast media in patients undergoing hemodialysis."

Clinical outcomes were evaluated in 1,558 consecutive, unselected, retrospectively collected patients treated with drug-eluting stents (DESs; PES = 816, SES = 742) at 19 United States centers. The primary end point was 1-year target vessel revascularization (TVR). The study included a prespecified diabetic cohort (PES = 289, SES = 247), for which efficacy comparisons between DESs were analyzed according to vessel diameter and presence of chronic kidney disease. Baseline demographic, angiographic, and procedural characteristics were similar between patients treated with PESs and those treated with SESs. At 1 year, there were no overall statistical differences in death, myocardial infarction, TVR, or stent thrombosis. In the diabetic cohort, however, the cumulative incidence of TVR was significantly lower for patients treated with PESs (3%) compared with SESs (9%, p <0.01), which persisted after adjustment for baseline differences (hazard ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.67). This decrease in TVR with PES was similar in insulin- and noninsulin-requiring diabetic patients. In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of TVR included diabetes, bifurcation stenting, and overlapping stents; in the diabetic cohort, treatment with SESs was also a multivariate predictor of TVR. In conclusion, in this observational, retrospective analysis of DES-treated patients, PESs and SESs demonstrated similar overall safety and efficacy, but PESs were associated with a significant decrease in 1-year TVR rates in diabetic patients."

CD008691,0,11777319,0,Predictors of coronary disease in patients with end stage renal disease.,"Patients with end stage renal disease have a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease and coronary arteriography is often routinely performed prior to kidney transplantation. However, the value of the conventional risk factors and non-invasive markers of coronary artery disease (CAD) in triaging patients for coronary arteriography has not been fully examined. 116 patients with end stage renal disease were evaluated. Coronary arteriography was performed in all patients either for a suspicion of CAD or as part of a routine pre-transplant evaluation. Lesions causing > or = 50% luminal diameter stenosis in any of the three major coronary artery systems were considered significant. The mean age was 53.3 +/- 9.3 years. Significant CAD was present in 69 patients (60%). Increasing age, family history of premature ischemic heart disease, the presence of angina, abnormal Q waves on the ECG or abnormal ST segment depression and the presence of coronary calcification were significant markers of coronary artery disease. However male gender, diabetes mellitus and obesity did not correlate with coronary disease. Even though hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and smoking were also not useful predictors these could have been modified by the renal failure. In conclusion increasing age, a family history of premature ischemic heart disease and some non-invasive markers were useful predictors of coronary disease."

CD008691,0,17259697,0,Serum levels of calcification inhibition proteins and coronary artery calcium score: comparison between transplantation and dialysis.,"Vascular calcifications in CKD are now linked to serum alterations of both divalent ions and calcification inhibitory proteins. Due to possible biochemical differences between dialysis (D) and transplantation (Tx), we examined the entity and severity of these biochemical modifications and of coronary artery calcium score separately in these two populations. We assayed, besides standard markers of inflammation, divalent ions and serum levels of fetuin, matrix Gla protein (MGP) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), in 51 Tx patients (age 45 +/- 12 years; 30 males, 21 females; previous D duration 4.8 +/- 4.2 years; Tx since 6.6 +/- 5.5 years; Cr 1.8 +/- 0.6 mg/dl) and in 49 D patients (age 49 +/- 14 years; 30 males,19 females; D duration 5.6 +/- 4.8 years). Additionally, coronary calcium score (AS) was evaluated by cardiac multi-slice CT. Compared with D patients, Tx patients had better values of divalent ions and inflammation markers, and lower prevalence (65 vs. 86%; p < 0.02) and severity (AS = 570 +/- 1,637 vs. 1,311 +/- 3,128; p < 0.008) of coronary calcification. In addition, a tendency toward normalization for all of the three calcification inhibitory proteins was evident. In both Tx and D, AS correlated with age and OPG (Tx: r(s) = 0.439, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.510, p < 0.0001; D: r(s) = 0.471, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.403, p < 0.005, respectively); in D patients, a correlation was present also with D duration (r(s) = 0.435; p < 0.002), other markers of inflammation and, notably, fetuin (r(s) = -0.442; p < 0.002). Regression analysis selected previous time on D in Tx patients (r(m) = 0.400; p < 0.004), and C-reactive protein and OPG in D patients (r(m) = 0.518; p < 0.004) as the most predictive parameters of AS. Discriminant analysis confirmed the major role of age and D duration in the appearance of AS and evidenced male gender as a distinct risk condition. At variance, Tx duration was never associated with AS. In conclusion, as compared to D, renal Tx patients show serum levels of calcification inhibition proteins and of divalent ions closer to normal. As this is associated with a lower prevalence and severity of AS, it is suggested that Tx antagonize the accelerating role of D in the progression of vascular calcification. Assessment of both coronary calcifications and serum levels of calcification inhibitory proteins may be of value to identify those subjects at higher risk of development and progression of vascular lesions, among whom males have the highest rate."
CD008691,0,15828903,0,Different routes bridging calcium in Japanese hemodialysis patients.,"There is growing evidence that not only serum calcium concentration but also excess calcium load is associated with vascular calcification and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Calcium load in hemodialysis patients cumulatively comes from three different routes: oral intake of calcium including calcium-based phosphate binders, traffic of calcium from/to dialysate, and calcemic action of vitamin D. The K/DOQI guidelines recommend sevelamer hydrochloride instead of calcium-containing phosphate binders to control serum phosphate concentration. However, in Japan, both kinds of phosphate binders are used concomitantly, mainly because Japanese patients are prone to a higher incidence of sevelamer-associated adverse events such as gastrointestinal symptoms. Regarding the calcium concentration of dialysate (D-Ca) in Japan, 3.0 mEq/L is more popular than 2.5 mEq/L. Calcium loaded through 3.0 mEq/L dialysate may lead to metastatic calcification rather than to bone formation because serum phosphate concentration rebounds several hours after the end of each hemodialysis session when plasma pH is still high. In contrast, use of 2.5 mEq/L dialysate may result in an unfavorable increase of intact parathyroid hormone particularly when the amount of oral calcium intake is reduced. Although a higher dose of vitamin D is required to counteract the stimulation of parathyroid glands, hypercalcemia is less likely with 2.5 mEq/L dialysate. As the new K/DOQI guidelines are released, it is time to discuss the appropriate D-Ca as well as doses and kinds of phosphate binders and vitamin D for the comprehensive management of Japanese hemodialysis patients."

CD008691,0,7862226,0,[Kidney transplantation in patients more than 60 years old. Analysis of results apropos of 57 patients].,"From April 1988 to August 1993, 57 elderly recipients more than 60 years old (mean age 64 +/- 3 years, 35 males, 22 females) underwent cadaveric renal transplantation. The pretransplant screening included immunological and viral status and urological examination; cardiovascular risk factors were systematically estimated by medical history, physical examination, echocardiography, femoral arterial doppler, and myocardial stress thallium imaging. A coronarography was performed if myocardial ischemia was evidenced. Patients free of cardiovascular diseases or after correction of vascular and/or coronary lesions were included in the waiting list. A sequential immunosuppression regimen including azathioprine, prednisolone anad antilymphocyte globulins was given in all patients. Oral cyclosporin A (5-8 mg/kg/day) was started when serum creatinine level decreased to 200 mumol/l; antilymphocyte globulins were stopped when whole trough blood cyclosporin level reached 150-200 ng/ml. After 24 months of follow-up, the patient survival rate of elderly recipients was significantly lower than the survival rate observed in patients less than 60 years old (90% vs 97%; p < 0.005); the deaths were related to cardiovascular complications in 3 cases and to infectious diseases in 3 cases. No abdominal complications were observed in our series. The graft survival was identical in both groups (81% vs 82% at 2 years), and we observed a low incidence of acute rejection (23%) in the elderly group. The graft function, as determined by serum creatinine level, is significantly correlated with the donor age (p < 0.05). We conclude that the patients more than 60 years old, free of ischemic coronary disease or after correction of such a lesion could be safely transplanted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008691,0,16202107,0,Long-term outcome after coronary angioplasty in renal transplant and hemodialysis patients.,"In order to determine how renal transplantation modifies in hospital and long-term outcome after coronary angioplasty, we compared dialysis and renal transplant patients with control patients without renal failure. Seventy-five consecutive dialysis patients (group D) and 37 renal transplant patients (group T) undergoing coronary angioplasty, were compared with two control groups (groups control D and control T, respectively) matched 1:1 with groups D and T for clinical and angiographic characteristics. The mean follow-up was 50 months. The rate of angiographic success was high and comparable in the four groups (P=0.7). Renal transplant patients were younger than dialysis non-transplant patients (P=0.004). The risk of 4-year cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction was higher in dialysis compared to control dialysis patients (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.35--5.01, P=0.004), in transplant patients compared to control transplant patients (OR 9.93, 95% CI 1.17--84.04, P=0.03), and there was a trend toward a higher risk in dialysis than in renal transplant patients (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8--3.19, P=0.08). The risk of 4-year mortality was higher in dialysis patients than in the other three groups (31% in group D versus 19% in group T, 13% in group control D, and 0% in group control T, P<0.001). After adjusting for age, diabetes, and multivessel disease, long-term mortality risk was similar in dialysis and renal transplant patients. On multivariate analysis, renal function (P=0.002), age (P=0.005), and tobacco consumption (P=0.005) were independently associated with 4-year cardiac death. In patients with end-stage renal disease who undergo coronary angioplasty, renal transplantation was not independently associated with a lower long-term mortality compared to dialysis treatment. Both dialysis and renal transplant patients show lower survival rates compared to matched control patients."

CD008691,0,7977476,0,Myocardial alterations during hemodialysis: insights from new noninvasive technology.,"Eighteen patients with chronic renal failure had their cardiac status monitored during hemodialysis (HD). Ten studies were carried out using an ambulatory nuclear vest to assess ejection fraction (EF), heart rate (HR), relative end-systolic (ESV) and end-diastolic (EDV) volumes every 60 s. A total of 36 episodes of EF falls occurred in 9 patients, all asymptomatic. These EF falls were associated with a rise in ESV, while HR, BP, and EDV remained unchanged. The EF falls correlated best with the volume of ultrafiltrate removed. Ten patients had on-line ST-segment monitoring with sestamibi injection either at the time of ST depression (STD) or at the end of dialysis, if no STD occurred, in order to detect the presence of transient ischemia. Seven of ten patients had perfusion defects after dialysis, with STD occurring in 3 of 10 patients. Predialysis imaging was available in only 8 of 10 patients, and 6 of these patients had perfusion defects. Changes in perfusion defects were not significantly different in the 3 patients with STD compared with those without STD. EF falls and perfusion defects are common in HD patients even in the absence of known coronary artery disease; however, ST segment monitoring is not a sensitive tool for its detection. These changes in function and perfusion may represent myocardial ischemia and contribute to the high incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this patient population."

CD008691,0,9141000,0,Onset of coronary artery disease prior to initiation of haemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease.,"To determine whether the onset of coronary artery disease may precede the initiation of dialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease, we performed coronary angiography within 1 month of initiation of maintenance haemodialysis in 24 patients (age range 42-78 years; mean 63.7 +/- 11). Coronary angiography was performed regardless of the absence or presence of angina. Fifteen patients had diabetic nephropathy, and nine had non-diabetic nephropathy. Significant coronary stenosis was defined as at least 75% narrowing of the reference segment. Fifteen patients (62.5%) with a total of 49 lesions were classified as the coronary artery disease present group. Eleven of those 15 (73.3%) had multivessel disease. The average number of stenotic lesions was 3.3 per patient. The most common patterns of stenosis were complex (23 lesions; 47%), and diffuse lesions over 20 mm long (14 lesions; 29%). None of the clinical or haematological factors evaluated differed significantly between the groups with and without coronary artery disease. The prevalence of coronary artery disease was 72.7% in the symptomatic patients and 53.8% in the asymptomatic patients. The diagnosis of coronary artery disease at the start of maintenance haemodialysis based only on chest symptoms and clinical factors proved to be difficult. Coronary angiography is thus essential for evaluating coronary artery disease in uraemic patients. Many patients with end-stage renal disease had coronary artery disease prior to the start of haemodialysis."

To separate the effects of fluid removal rate on LV function in CAD, we investigated the same patients with identical overall volume loss of 4 liters during two different treatment times (4 hr and 2 hr). HD significantly increased resting LV ejection fraction (EF) from 55.7 +/- 8% to 64.7 +/- 8% (P less than 0.01) during the 4 hr HD and from 58.1 +/- 9 to 68.1 +/- 10 (P less than 0.05) during the 2 hr HD. Indicating ischemia, EF decreased at pre- and postdialysis peak exercise without differences between both treatments. HD also resulted in an improved segmental wall motion score. Exercise duration as well as S-T segment depression and angina score improved during HD, whereas heart rate, blood pressure and double product remained unchanged. We conclude that HD improves global and regional resting LV function and exercise tolerance in patients with CAD. The degree of interdialytic hydration and not the degree of fluid removal per time affects LV performance in CAD. Since LV function is the major prognostic factor in CAD, those patients require volume restriction and/or shorter interdialytic phases."
CD008691,0,11397353,0,Creatine kinase-MB fraction elevation after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with chronic renal failure.,"We evaluated the short- and long-term clinical outcomes of 326 consecutive patients with chronic renal failure, not on dialysis, who had creatine kinase (CK)-myocardial band (MB) fraction elevation after successful percutaneous coronary intervention in a native coronary artery. Based on peak CK-MB levels measured after intervention, patients were divided into 3 groups: no elevation (group 1, n = 184), 1 to 3 x upper normal levels (group 2, n = 72), and >3 x upper normal levels (group 3, n = 70). Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics were similar among the 3 groups. Angiographic success was similar among the 3 groups, although there was a significantly higher use of intra-aortic balloon pump in patients who had postprocedural CK-MB >3 x normal values and a higher rate of in-hospital complications, i.e., repeat catheterization, repeat target lesion intervention, pulmonary edema, renal function deterioration, emergency dialysis, and major bleeding complications. At 1-year follow-up, mortality rates were significantly higher in these patients (35.4% vs 22.0% for patients with CK-MB 1 to 3 x normal values and 16.7% for patients without CK-MB elevation, p = 0.007). Multivariate analysis showed that CK-MB >3 x normal (odds ratio 3.04; 95% confidence interval 1.41 to 6.57, p = 0.005) and intra-aortic balloon pump (odds ratio 1.49; confidence interval 1.15 to 1.93, p = 0.002) were independent predictors of late mortality. Therefore, patients with chronic renal failure who had CK-MB elevation >3 x the upper normal limit after a successful percutaneous coronary intervention had a higher incidence of in-hospital complications and a significantly higher mortality rate at 1-year follow-up than patients without CK-MB elevation or with <3 x normal CK-MB elevation."
CD008691,0,1968526,0,Long-term cardiorespiratory effects of amelioration of renal anaemia by erythropoietin.,"The long-term cardiorespiratory effects of recombinant human erythropoietin treatment were investigated in ten haemodialysis patients by means of maximum exercise testing, lung function tests, echocardiography, chest X-ray, and rheological assessment over 12 months. There were significant rises in exercise time (mean [SD] 13.2 [5.5] to 20.0 [6.2] min), maximum oxygen consumption (19.1 [7.0] to 25.0 [6.7] ml.min-1.kg-1), and anaerobic threshold (11.7 [3.6] to 15.4 [4.8] ml.min-1.kg-1) after 2 months of erythropoietin treatment. The improvements were maintained but not augmented on repeat testing after 4, 8, and 12 months of therapy. Carbon monoxide transfer [corrected] rose from 15.5 (2.9) to 18.6 (3.7) ml.min-1.mm Hg-1. There was a substantial reduction in exercise-induced cardiac ischaemia (eight patients had significant ST segment depression before erythropoietin, only one after 2 months' treatment, and none after 12 months' treatment), despite a significant rise in whole blood viscosity. Left ventricular mass, as estimated by echocardiography, progressively decreased from 354 (169) g to 251 (95) g after 12 months' treatment, and four patients showed a reduction in cardiothoracic ratio on chest X-ray."

CD008691,0,9567044,0,[A case of MIDCAB to the left circumflex via the left posterolateral thoracotomy].,"There have been many reports of MIDCAB to left anterior descending artery via a small dissection utilizing the left anterolateral thoracotomy. We report here a case of CABG reoperation to the circumflex artery by MIDCAB via the left posterolateral thoracotomy. A 66-year-old male patient had received a 3 branch bypass graft on the LITA-LAD and the SVG-OM-4 PD at another institution. Postoperative angiography revealed a SVG occlusion. Since repeated intervention was unsuccessful, reoperation was necessary. To preserve the patency of the LITA, the 4th left intercostal posterolateral thoracotomy was selected. We utilized a commercially available rib retractor for MIDCAB, as well as a stabilizer and a CO2 blower to obtain a nearly perfect bloodless stabilized view. A new SVG was used to connect the left circumflex artery. The operation was successful without any postoperative complications or need for transfusion. After a two week hospital stay, the graft patency was confirmed and the patient was discharged."
CD008691,0,11793497,0,Clinical outcome following percutaneous coronary interventions in patients with chronic renal failure.,"The clinical outcome of patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been systematically evaluated in a large cohort of patients. We retrospectively analyzed the in-hospital and 1-year clinical outcomes of 10,076 consecutive patients who underwent PCI between January 1994 and December 1997. A total of 95 patients (0.9%) had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis, 786 patients (7.8%) had CRF, and 9,125 patients (90.6%) had normal renal function. Despite an angiographic success rate of 97% in all three groups, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher among patients with renal disease, whether they were on dialysis or not, when compared to patients without renal dysfunction (6.8% vs. 4.2% vs. 0.9%; P < 0.0001). At 1-year follow-up, mortality rate was 48.8% for ESRD, 25.7% for patients with CRF, and 5.5%, for patients without renal dysfunction (P < 0.0001). By multivariate analysis, high left ventricular ejection fraction and creatinine clearance were associated with decreased late mortality (OR = 0.84 and 0.95; P < 0.0001), whereas ESRD (OR = 3.65; P = 0.0002), non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (OR = 2.21; P < 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.99; P < 0.0001), and CRF (OR = 1.74; P = 0.003) were independent correlates of increased late mortality. Therefore, PCI in patients with impaired renal function, whether on dialysis or not, is associated with poor in-hospital and 1-year survival."

CD008691,0,11382689,0,Plasma brain natriuretic peptide levels in chronic hemodialysis patients: influence of coronary artery disease.,"A noninvasive biochemical testing method for early detection and monitoring the condition of cardiac complications in hemodialysis (HD) patients would be useful and might lead to improved survival. The aim of this study is to clarify the pathophysiological significance of plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in HD patients with and without coronary artery disease (CAD). We measured plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and BNP levels on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday before and after HD in 28 consecutive patients who underwent HD three times weekly. In addition, we measured plasma ANP and BNP levels in 21 HD patients with CAD and 27 HD patients without CAD and studied the relationships between BNP levels and cardiac function and clinical variables. Plasma ANP levels significantly decreased after HD on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and predialysis plasma ANP levels on Monday were significantly greater than those on other days. Plasma BNP levels did not change after HD on Monday; however, they significantly decreased after HD on Wednesday and FRIDAY: Predialysis plasma BNP levels on Monday were greater than those on other days, and postdialysis plasma BNP levels on Monday were greater than predialysis plasma BNP levels on WEDNESDAY: Plasma BNP levels in HD patients with CAD were significantly greater than those in HD patients without CAD and significantly correlated with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (r = -0.69), end-diastolic volume index (r = 0.59), and end-systolic volume index (r = 0.84) determined by left ventriculography. Conversely, plasma BNP levels in HD patients without CAD significantly correlated with LV mass index (r = 0.54) determined by echocardiography and mean systolic blood pressure (r = 0.72) determined by 48-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. These results suggest the following: (1) plasma BNP levels before and after HD in chronic HD patients directly correlate with the degree of body fluid retention, and the day of the week on which the sample is obtained should be considered for its evaluation; (2) plasma BNP levels reflect LV function in HD patients with CAD; and (3) plasma BNP levels reflect LV mass and blood pressure in HD patients without CAD."

Our aim was to examine aortic compliance in patients with ESRD using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to compare these with patients with advanced atherosclerotic disease who are known to be at high cardiovascular risk. We examined a total of 83 subjects matched for age: 24 had ESRD and were on dialysis therapy for 3+/-6 years, 24 had severe coronary artery disease (CAD), 11 had both ESRD and CAD (4+/-5 years on dialysis therapy), and 24 healthy subjects with no evidence of CAD. Vascular and cardiac function was assessed using cardiac MRI. Aortic compliance was significantly reduced in patients with CAD compared to control subjects (11.3+/-6.3 ml x 10(-3)/mm Hg vs 15.6+/-6.0 ml x 10(-3)/mm Hg, P=0.009). Patients with ESRD also exhibited significantly reduced aortic compliance compared to healthy controls (12.4+/-5.8 ml x 10(-3)/mm Hg vs 15.6+/-6.0 ml 10(-3)/mm Hg, P=0.012), whereas there was no significant difference in aortic compliance between patients with CAD and ESRD. Even in the absence of symptomatic CAD, patients with ESRD have significantly reduced aortic compliance compared to normal subjects. Patients with ESRD have equivalent aortic compliance to patients with advanced CAD. These findings suggest that a significantly reduced aortic compliance is one of many mechanisms promoting premature cardiovascular events in patients with ESRD compared to age-matched controls from the general population."

After an incision into the target coronary artery, the calcified arterial wall was resected using a punch to make an oval hole for anastomosis. Limited endarterectomy, which consisted of dissection and removal of the calcified endothelium and media around this hole, preserving the adventitia, enabled the anastomosis. This technique can be used for a severely calcified coronary artery that is unamendable to conventional coronary artery bypass grafting."

We present a case of simultaneous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and renal transplantation. A 64-year-old man was to undergo in vivo heterogenous renal transplantation for chronic renal failure. Angiography was undertaken for preoperative abnormal electrocardiography, which showed severe long segmental stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery. We discussed the possibility of simultaneous surgery, conducting off-pump CABG and renal transplantation at the same time.

The aim of study was to determine whether CRP, low albumin and troponin are markers of overall and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients. 138 stable hemodialysis patients were divided into 2 groups n= 66 patients with coronary disease equivalent (known coronary or peripheral vascular disease or diabetes mellitus) and n= 72 patients without it. The two groups were then stratified by biomarkers [cardiac troponin T and albumin and highly sensitive CRP (hs-CRP)] and followed for 30 months. The primary outcome was all causes mortality. Patients with coronary disease equivalents had 3.5 fold greater annual mortality compared to controls (24%% vs 6.9%, P value = 0.005). Elevated troponin T had a further increase in the risk for death while hs-CRP and low albumin were not associated with risk of death In conclusion, circulating cardiac troponin-T was associated with poor prognosis especially in hemodialysis patients with coronary risk factors."
CD008691,0,16467746,0,Contrast-induced nephropathy: epidemiology and prevention.,"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a leading cause of iatrogenic acute kidney failure. Periprocedural CIN results in a greater risk of requiring renal replacement therapy, prolonged hospitalization, excessive health care costs, potential long term kidney impairment and mortality. Identified risk factors for CIN include premorbid chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, critical illness and volume of administered contrast media. Prophylactic interventions for the prevention of CIN remain controversial and uncertain. In this review we critically appraise the evidence for prevention of CIN. In general, every attempt should be made to correct underlying volume depletion, discontinue potential nephrotoxins, reverse any acute kidney dysfunction or when not possible, consider delay of procedure or an alternative modality for imaging. A minimum volume of contrast media should be employed, including going left ventriculogram and performing staged procedures if applicable. There are few interventions with quality evidence for reducing the incidence of CIN. procedure hydration and the use of nonionic iso-osmolar contrast media have consistently demonstrated efficacy. For patients at high risk, there is evidence to suggest benefit with N-acetylcysteine. Clinical studies with adenosine antagonists are encouraging; however, further confirmatory trials are required. Based on the available studies, there is inadequate evidence for the routine use of hemofiltration, atrial natriuretic peptides, calcium channel blockers, or prostaglandins. There is no evidence to support prophylaxis with diuretic therapy, forced diuresis, low dose dopamine, fenoldopam, captopril, or endothelin receptor antagonists. Despite recent advances in the epidemiology, pathophysiology and natural history of CIN, few effective prophylactic or therapeutic interventions have conclusively demonstrated evidence for a reduction in CIN incidence and no therapy has proven efficacious once CIN is established."
CD008691,0,16815856,0,Conversion to a proliferation signal inhibitor in a patient with coronary artery disease--a case report.,"The calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) ciclosporin (CsA) and tacrolimus are currently an important part of immunosuppressive regimens, but are associated with increased cardiovascular risk factors, including hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Conversion from CNI-based regimens to proliferation signal inhibitors or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, such as everolimus and sirolimus, has been associated with an improvement in cardiovascular risk. This case study describes a 59-year-old renal transplant recipient who presented with angina pectoris while receiving immunosuppression with CsA, azathioprine and steroids. The patient developed angina pectoris 5 years after receiving a cadaveric renal transplant. At the time, the patient was obese, with hypertension controlled with diuretics and calcium channel blockers, and hyperlipidaemia controlled with statins. A scintigram revealed plurisegmental myocardial ischaemia, and a coronary angiogram showed the presence of occlusions in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex coronary artery. The patient also had 70% stenosis of the right coronary artery, which was corrected by angioplastic percutaneous intervention. The patient was converted from azathioprine to sirolimus 2 mg/day (trough blood level, 6-10 ng/ml), while the CsA dose was tapered and withdrawn. The angina pectoris subsequently resolved, no progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) has been observed during follow-up and stable renal function has been maintained throughout. Conversion to an immunosuppressive regimen of sirolimus with CsA withdrawal, along with angioplastic percutaneous correction of right coronary artery stenosis, therefore led to the complete resolution of angina pectoris and no progression of the CAD was noticed in this obese renal transplant patient with drug-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidaemia."

CD008691,0,17719339,0,Frequency and cause of cardiac troponin T elevation in chronic hemodialysis patients from study of cardiovascular magnetic resonance.,"Cardiac troponin T level predicts a gradient risk for death in patients using hemodialysis. We used cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to determine whether an asymptomatic increase of troponin T in patients using hemodialysis is associated with subclinical myocardial infarction (MI). Twenty-six patients using long-term hemodialysis (49 +/- 12 years of age, 19 men, 8 diabetics) with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction >40% and no known coronary artery disease were selected based on a low-risk troponin T level </=0.03 ng/ml (median 0.02, interquartile range 0.00 to 0.02, n = 13) and high-risk troponin T level >/=0.07 ng/ml (median 0.15, interquartile range 0.09 to 0.19, n = 13). All underwent CMR imaging for LV mass and for MI by late gadolinium enhancement. Between high- and low-risk patients using hemodialysis, there were no differences in age, gender, ethnicity, or diabetes mellitus. Of the high-risk patients, 3 (23%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5 to 54) had MI by late gadolinium enhancement versus 0 (0%, 95% CI 0 to 25) low-risk patients (p = 0.22). A diffuse, midwall late gadolinium enhancement pattern was seen in 1 high-risk patient (8%) versus 0 low-risk patient (0%, 95% CI 0 to 25, p = 0.97). Height-adjusted LV mass and LV hypertrophy were not significantly different between high-risk (62 +/- 26 g/m(2.7), LV hypertrophy, n = 7, 54%) and low-risk (54 +/- 20 g/m(2.7), LV hypertrophy, n = 5, 39%) patients (p = 0.37 for LV mass, p = 0.69 for LV hypertrophy). In conclusion, MI detected by CMR is present in few patients on hemodialysis with high troponin T levels and absent in the setting of very low troponin T levels, suggesting that additional myocardial pathologies cause increased troponin T in patients using hemodialysis."
CD008691,0,10535717,0,Surgical treatment of interventional coronary angiographic accidents.,"Newer methodologies have increased the incidence of coronary interventions. At the authors' institution, 5,614 coronary interventional procedures (28% of all catheterizations) were performed over a 3-year period, from 1995 to 1997. Eighty-one patients (1.4%) suffered angiographic accidents, including coronary artery dissection, free rupture, tamponade, foreign body embolism, and wire entrapment, and were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were taken for emergency surgery in less than 4 hours. The mean age was 61.2 years, 44 (54%) were men, and 37 (46%) were in cardiogenic shock at the time of surgery. Fifty-seven patients (70%) had intraaortic balloon counterpulsation. The number of previous cardiac interventions ranged from one to four with a mean of 1.9. One to five bypass grafts (mean, 2.2) were performed, and three patients required temporary ventricular assist devices. There were six deaths for a 30-day mortality rate of 7.4%. Thirty-two patients (39.5%) suffered significant morbidity, including cerebrovascular accidents, and renal and respiratory failure. Perioperative myocardial infarctions were diagnosed in 39 (48%) patients. Average length of stay was 12.1 days. One-year survival was satisfactory at 90% (73/81), with 56 survivors (77%) regaining normal everyday activity. Early surgical intervention, rapid revascularization, and temporary mechanical support are keys to low mortality in this high-risk group. Identification of high-risk interventions and significant comorbid conditions, with concomitant surgical consultation, need to be pursued to reduce the high morbidity rate."

These patients were divided into 3 groups according to initial level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR, MDRD equation): group 1 - 466 patients with GFR >60 ml/min/1,73 m(2), group 2 - 233 patients with GFR 30 - 60 ml/min/1,73 m(2), group 3 - 38 patients with GFR <30 ml/min/1,73 m(2). In all group 2 and 3 patients prevention of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) was implemented: hydration before and after angiography, limitation of intake of nephrotoxic drugs, N acetylcysteine 600 mg/day orally. In all group 2 and 3 patients only contrast preparation iodixanol was used. Total amount of contrast did not exceed 350 ml in patients with GFR 45-59 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 250 ml - with GFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m(2). In all patients with GFR 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) low osmolar contrast preparations were used (total amount - less then 600 ml per patient). Immediate success of PCI was similar in all groups (99.4%, 98.2% 97.4%, respectively). Rate of CIN rose significantly in groups 2 and 3 (0.4%, 4.9%, 13.2%, respectively, <0.001). Before 6 months after PCI restenosis developed more frequently with lowering of GFR (group 1 - 11%, group 2 - 22%, group 3 - 34%, <0.001). Myocardial infarction developed by 3 years in 6, 10, and 26% of patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Lethality during 3 years was 5, 10, and 24% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Regression analysis showed that as a whole 3 years rate of myocardial infarction rose 1.57 times in group 2 compared with group 1, and 3.91 times in group 3 compared with group 1. Mortality by 3 years rose 1.93 times in group 2 compared with group 1, and 4.52 times in group 3 compared with group 1. Thus, presence of initially lowered GFR increases risk of CIN after elective implantations of standard stents, leads to rise of restenosis rate by 6 months and increase of mortality and rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction by 3 years."

CD008691,0,16647461,0,Evaluation of type 1 diabetics for simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation with regard to cardiovascular risk.,"The main cause of death for diabetic patients and patients on dialysis is coronary artery disease (CAD). The most common cause of graft loss following simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation (SPK) is death with a functioning graft due to CAD. Therefore, careful pretransplantation evaluation of CAD is mandatory. In our series, every patient undergoes a noninvasive cardiac function test like dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) or myocardial thallium scintigraphy using adenosine to induce medical stress. Thirty patients were evaluated for SPK: 15 patients with myocardial scintigraphy and 8 with DSE. Seven investigations showed pathological findings and we performed coronary angiograms, none of which showed coronary artery stenosis. Seven primary coronary angiograms were performed: four due to a history of CAD and three as a primary diagnostic. Following SPK one patient died at 21 days after transplantation due to myocardial infarction. He had a history of CAD with angioplasty and stent implantation. Noninvasive cardiac function tests like DSE or myocardial scintigraphy are reliable methods to evaluate CAD in patients with diabetic nephropathy awaiting SPK. In case of a suspicious finding or a history of CAD, a coronary angiogram should be performed to assess the need for revascularization. Following this algorithm we may further reduce the mortality of SPK."

CD008691,0,11172558,0,Risk and benefit of coronary revascularization in renal transplant candidates.,"The field of transplantation along with all of medicine has made tremendous progress in the past 30 years. Patients with end-stage renal disease are managed more effectively despite increasing chronic multisystemic comorbidities, particularly involving their cardiovascular system. These same patients are also undergoing renal transplant surgery with better short- and long-term results than any era previous. We will present some of the changing demographics encountered in today's renal transplant candidates along with the processes our institution is undertaking to optimize the patient's success with the renal allograft, particularly with respect to the diagnosis and therapeutics used to manage coronary artery disease."
CD008691,0,19384844,0,How long is the warranty period for nil or low coronary artery calcium in patients new to hemodialysis?,"Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease on dialysis. A sizeable proportion of patients has no or minimal CAC at the inception of dialysis, but it is unclear how long they remain free of it."
CD008691,0,17338428,0,Evaluation of the role of severe hyperparathyroidism on coronary artery calcification in dialysis patients.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are at a high risk of dying from a cardiovascular event, mainly due to coronary calcification. Among the various uremic and dialysis-specific risk factors for coronary calcification are mineral metabolism disorders. The role that secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) consequent to the altered calcium and phosphate metabolism plays in the pathogenesis of coronary calcification remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of coronary artery calcification in dialysis patients with severe SHPT submitted to multislice coronary tomography (MSCT) and to identify risk factors for coronary calcification."
CD008691,0,12975596,0,Multicenter prospective investigation on cardiovascular adverse effects of tacrolimus in kidney transplantations.,"To clarify the incidence and pathophysiological mechanism of cardiovascular adverse effects of tacrolimus, the present prospective study performed scheduled cardiovascular examinations at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 20, and 24 weeks after starting the tacrolimus therapy in 68 consecutive kidney transplantation recipients enrolled from 26 institutes in Japan. Patients with previous coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure were excluded. The examinations included any subjective symptoms, changes in resting ECG, ambulatory Holter's dynamic ECG, two-dimensional echocardiography, and monitoring of serum drug concentrations and cardiac troponin T levels. Cardiac nuclear imaging and/or coronary angiography were performed in the case of suspicious coronary events. During the investigation, chest pain in 9 (13.2%) and palpitation in 6 patients (8.8%) were reported, both closely related to elevated blood drug concentrations (37.2 +/- 18.7 ng/mL, mean +/- SD). Cardiovascular examinations detected development of resting ECG abnormalities in 12 patients (17.6%), asymptomatic ST depression following increased heart rate in 11 (16.2%) and ventricular arrhythmias in 7 patients (10.3%) on Holter's dynamic ECG. Elevation of troponin T was detected in 3 patients (4.4%), which was also closely related to elevated drug concentrations and interpreted as myocardial damage associated with the therapy. Assessments by thallium(Tl)-201 myocardial scintigraphy and/or coronary angiography in patients with suspicious coronary events revealed only two patients (2.9%) were considered to be myocardial ischemia associated with coronary vasospasm or microcirculatory disturbance. Sequential evaluations on echocardiography revealed significant (p<0.05) decrease in LV end-diastolic dimension (4, 8, 18 and 24 weeks) and LV end-systolic dimension (from 1 to 24 weeks), and significant (p<0.05) increase in LV ejection fraction 1 to 4 weeks after the kidney transplantation. Thickening of LV wall (>2 mm compared with baseline) was detected in only one patient. The present prospective study detected totally 30.9% incidence of cardiovascular adverse events. Symptomatic events and troponin T elevation were closely related to elevated blood drug concentrations (>20 ng/ml). Coronary vasomotor dysfunction seemed to be related to these adverse events especially when the blood drug concentration was exceeding 20 ng/ml."
CD008691,0,18805100,0,Association between serum uric acid and perioperative and late cardiovascular outcome in patients with suspected or definite coronary artery disease undergoing elective vascular surgery.,"The role of uric acid as an independent marker of cardiovascular risk is unclear. Therefore, our aim was to assess the independent contribution of preoperative serum uric acid levels to the risk of 30-day and late mortality and major adverse cardiac event (MACE) in patients scheduled for open vascular surgery. In total, 936 patients (76% male, age 68 +/- 11 years) were enrolled. Hyperuricemia was defined as serum uric acid >0.42 mmol/l for men and >0.36 mmol/l for women, as defined by large epidemiological studies. Outcome measures were 30-day and late mortality and MACE (cardiac death or myocardial infarction). Multivariable logistic and Cox regression analysis were used, adjusting for age, gender, and all cardiac risk factors. Data are presented as odds ratios or hazard ratios, with 95% confidence intervals. Hyperuricemia was present in 299 patients (32%). The presence of hyperuricemia was associated with heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and the use of diuretics. Perioperatively, 46 patients (5%) died and 61 patients (7%) experienced a MACE. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range: 0 to 17 years). During follow-up, 282 patients (30%) died and 170 patients (18%) experienced a MACE. After adjustment for all clinical risk factors, the presence of hyperuricemia was not significantly associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality or MACE, odds ratios of 1.5 (0.8 to 2.8) and 1.7 (0.9 to 3.0), respectively. However, the presence of hyperuricemia was associated with an increased risk of late mortality and MACE, with hazard ratios of 1.4 (1.1 to 1.7) and 1.7 (1.3 to 2.3), respectively. In conclusion, the presence of preoperative hyperuricemia in vascular patients is a significant predictor of late mortality and MACE."
CD008691,0,15199357,0,Outcomes of elderly patients with cardiogenic shock treated with early percutaneous revascularization.,Subgroup analysis from the Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock (SHOCK) trial indicated that patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) complicated by cardiogenic shock (CS) who were > or =75 years old did not benefit from early revascularization and may have been harmed; their mortality rate at 30 days was 75%. The applicability of this subset analysis from a select patient population enrolled in a randomized trial to the general population is unclear.
CD008691,0,8231036,0,Screening diabetic transplant candidates for coronary artery disease: identification of a low risk subgroup.,"Coronary artery disease is the major cause of death in diabetic renal transplant recipients. Because one-third of diabetic transplant candidates have clinically silent coronary artery disease, many transplant centers recommend coronary angiography prior to transplantation. However, angiography is expensive and may precipitate acute renal failure. Therefore, we developed a noninvasive screening algorithm to identify patients at low risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), defined as one or more coronary stenoses > or = 50% diameter. We performed coronary angiography in 141 consecutive asymptomatic Caucasian type I diabetic renal transplant candidates. Fourteen of 16 patients age 45 or older had CAD. One hundred and twenty-five patients under age 45 were randomly divided into two groups. Ninety patients were used to identify clinical factors significantly associated with CAD which included smoking for five or more pack years, nonspecific ST-T wave changes on electrocardiogram, and diabetes duration 25 years or longer. The screening algorithm, ""CAD is predicted in diabetic transplant candidates under age 45 with any of the above risk factors,"" was then tested in the remaining 35 patients and in 35 additional patients. In these 70 patients, the algorithm had a sensitivity of 97% and a negative predictive accuracy of 96%. We conclude that coronary angiography should be recommended to Caucasian type I diabetic renal transplant candidates age 45 or older because of the high probability of disease. In patients younger than 45 without a smoking history, ST-T wave changes on EKG, or diabetes longer than 25 years, the likelihood of CAD is low and angiography can be avoided."
CD008691,0,15216484,0,Cardiovascular risk in stage 4 and 5 nephropathy.,"Severity of heart disease of almost all types, as well as mortality risk associated with heart disease, increases in step with severity of kidney disease, although not necessarily in a linear fashion. Heart failure is more common and just as lethal as ischemic heart disease in patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). The incidence of nonfatal heart disease in dialysis and transplant populations has now been described in detail. Although standard risk factors for heart disease that are more common among patients with CKD than in the general population do not adequately explain the greatly increased risk of heart disease in patients with severe CKD, neither do as yet identified ""nontraditional"" risk factors. However, in addition to the factors not common in the general population, such as anemia, hyperphosphatemia, and markers of systemic inflammation, patients with CKD in the modern era may also exhibit excessive thrombotic tendencies. Screening for heart disease in this population relies mainly on dobutamine stress echocardiography or nuclear scintigraphy. The role of electron beam CT (EBCT) scanning is currently controversial. The indications for coronary angiography are the same for patients with CKD as for the general population, but patients with CKD are at greatly increased risk for contrast-associated nephropathy, the least controversial preventive therapy, which consists of isotonic saline and N-acetylcysteine. Finally, patients with CKD do not currently receive adequate medical therapy for prevention and treatment of heart disease."
CD008691,0,15607622,0,Inflection point of ascending aortic waveform is a predictive factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis.,"The reflection waveform in the ascending aortic pressure has been reported to reflect systemic arterial stiffness, and increase risk of coronary heart disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate prospectively whether the reflection waveform in the ascending aortic pressure is associated with the mortality in patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis."
CD008691,0,15241739,0,The evaluation of underlying cardiovascular disease among patients with end-stage renal disease.,"Although coronary artery disease (CAD) is highly prevalent among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), interventions proven to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality are underutilized in this population of patients. Given the burden of CVD in this population, knowledge of specific diagnostic tests for detection and evaluation of CAD in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and their correlation with outcomes is imperative for the practicing nephrologist. Studies that examine the use of exercise electrocardiography testing, pharmacologic stress imaging, single-photon emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion imaging, electron beam computed tomography, and dobutamine stress echocardiography among patients with ESRD are detailed with recommendations for the noninvasive evaluation of CAD in this population."

CD008691,0,9304313,0,[Rate of restenosis after PTCA in patients with terminal renal failure. A quantitative coronary angiography study].,"Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have a high incidence of coronary artery disease. In 30-60% of these patients coronary artery disease can be demonstrated by coronary angiography often prompting myocardial revascularization. Previous studies on PTCA in patients with ESRD have suggested a high rate of procedural complications and restenosis. We studied the rate of restenosis after PTCA in 23 patients with chronic renal failure (17 males, 6 females, age: 52.5 +/- 18.3 years). After primarily successful PTCA all patients were restudied angiographically within 6-12 months. Using quantitative coronary angiography 13 patients (56%) demonstrated restenosis (stenosis > 50% luminal diameter). In 11 of these patients further revascularization therapy was indicated (6 x PTCA, 5 x CABG). Before follow-up angiography 12 patients demonstrated recurrence of angina pectoris, the sensitivity of clinical symptoms for angiographic restenosis was 69%. High concentrations of triglycerides (265 +/- 160 mg/dl), total cholesterol (258 +/- 53 mg/dl) with low HDL-levels (34 +/- 14 mg/dl) as well as elevated plasma levels of fibrinogen (481 +/- 114 mg/dl) were measured before PTCA. The mechanisms contributing to the high rate of coronary restenosis in patients with ESRD remain unclear, influence of lipid abnormalities, hemostatic factors and fibrinolytic state as well as primarily uremic factors have to be discussed. Prospective interventional studies are needed to address the relevance of PTCA for myocardial revascularization in this patient group."

In this study we aimed to examine the association between severity of coronary stenosis and renal function by quantifying the coronary lesions, angiographically and calculating the renal function with the use of GFR."
CD008691,0,2427239,0,Plasma levels of platelet secretory proteins.,"Platelets contain three types of secretory organelles: the dense granules, the alpha granules, and the lysosomes. Most of the proteins secreted from platelets are stored in the alpha granules, whereas the dense granules contain substances such as adenine nucleotides, serotonin, Ca++, and inorganic pyrophosphate types as well as a heparatinase. Three of the secreted alpha granule proteins have been measured by radioimmunoassay and it has been suggested that levels of these proteins in patient plasmas provide an index of in vivo platelet activation and secretion. These three are beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, and thrombospondin. In this chapter the chemistry of these proteins will be considered briefly, as will their clearance from the circulation, and then the clinical studies will be reviewed critically. Since radioimmunoassays were developed for these proteins (the first was reported in 1975), there has been a profusion of reports on levels of one or another of these proteins in a wide range of disease states, and these reports have indicated secreted platelet protein levels ranging from normal to grossly elevated in a given disease state. Possible reasons for such variability will be discussed."

CD008691,0,12001177,0,"Platelet activation and secretion in patients with major depression, thoracic aortic atherosclerosis, or renal dialysis treatment.","Relatively little is known concerning the magnitude of alterations of platelet activation and secretion markers of patients with major depression when compared to patients at increased risk for, or with current, clinically significant atherosclerosis. Markers of in vivo platelet stimulation and secretion were measured under basal conditions in normal comparison subjects (n = 12) and three patient groups: patients diagnosed with DSM-IV major depression (n = 15), dialysis-dependent patients (n = 12), and patients with severe thoracic aortic atherosclerosis (n = 10). In comparison to normal comparison subjects, depressed patients and patients with thoracic aortic atherosclerosis exhibited the greatest platelet stimulation as detected by increased anti-LIBS platelet binding. Dialysis-dependent patients exhibited the highest plasma concentrations of the renally-excreted platelet-specific secretion protein, beta-thromboglobulin. This study extends previous observations of increased platelet activation in patients with major depression and documents similar alterations in patients with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-documented thoracic aortic atherosclerosis. Future studies will determine whether the magnitude of platelet stimulation and secretion in patients with comorbid depression and atherosclerotic aortic disease is greater than that observed in nondepressed patients with atherosclerotic aortic disease or major depression alone. These findings provide further evidence for either increased platelet activation and/or intrinsic heightened platelet reactivity as one of the biological substrates underlying the increased risk of depressed patients for cardiovascular disease."
CD008691,0,16723988,0,"Oxidative stress, advanced glycation end product, and coronary artery calcification in hemodialysis patients.","Coronary artery calcification is an index of the severity of atherosclerotic vascular disease, and may predict future adverse cardiovascular events in uremic patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). HD patients are exposed to oxidative stress, and show high plasma levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The association between oxidative stress, AGEs, established cardiovascular risk factors, and coronary artery calcification score (CACS) was studied in 225 HD patients (123 male, 102 female patients). CACS was measured by using multi-detector row computed tomography. Age, systolic blood pressure, calcium, calcium x phosphate, malondialdehyde, lipid peroxides, and pentosidine were significantly and positively correlated with CACS. Duration on HD tended to be positively correlated with CACS. From the independent variables included in the forward stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, only age, systolic blood pressure, lipid peroxides, calcium, and pentosidine were independently associated with CACS. The odds ratios for past history of coronary artery disease and the presence of diabetes mellitus for high CACS (> or =100) were 6.25 (95% confidence interval; 1.83-21.4) and 2.03 (95% confidence interval; 1.02-4.05), respectively. The plasma pentosidine was significantly and positively correlated with indoxyl sulfate. In conclusion, in addition to such traditional cardiovascular risk factors as past history, diabetes mellitus, aging, systolic blood pressure and calcium overload, oxidative stress (lipid peroxides), and AGE (pentosidine) are associated with extensive coronary artery calcification in HD patients. Lipid peroxidation and glycoxidation may be involved in the pathogenesis of coronary artery calcification."

CD008691,0,17533516,0,"Postprocedural resistance of the target lesion is a strong predictor of subsequent revascularization: assessment by a novel lesion-specific physiological parameter, the epicardial resistance index.","Objective evaluation of the functional significance of individual stenosis in patients with multiple lesions is crucial when performing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Here we propose a novel lesion-specific parameter, the epicardial resistance index (ERI), which is derived from intracoronary pressure measurements, and validate its clinical usefulness. The ERI is defined as the ratio of the resistance of an epicardial coronary stenosis to that of downstream myocardium. After obtaining intracoronary pressure data by pull-back of a 0.014'' pressure wire, the ERI was calculated as the trans-lesional pressure gradient divided by (Pd-Pv) at maximum hyperemia, where Pd = the mean distal coronary pressure in the absence of any stenosis and Pv = the central venous pressure. Using 170 measurements obtained from 75 patients, the correlation of ERI with parameters obtained from quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was studied. ERI showed a significant correlation with the QCA-derived percent diameter stenosis (r = 0.67, P < 0.001), and with the IVUS-derived minimum luminal area (r = 0.68, P < 0.001). In 55 patients who underwent PCI with bare metal stents, a postprocedural target lesion ERI value greater than 0.16 strongly predicted the need for subsequent revascularization within six months (81% sensitivity and 80% specificity). The ERI is a useful pressure-derived hemodynamic parameter that correlates with anatomical parameters. In addition, the postprocedural resistance of the target lesion indicated by the ERI is a reliable predictor of the late outcome of PCI."
CD008691,0,9691592,0,[Perioperative management for nephrectomy in a long-term hemodialysis patient with anticoagulants for coronary stent].,"A 53-year old man on long-term hemodialysis (HD) with anticoagulant therapy was scheduled for nephrectomy due to renal cell carcinoma. Two months before surgery, a coronary stent had been placed due to right coronary artery disease. One week before surgery, percutaneous transmural coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was performed for unstable angina. Aggressive oral antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and ticlopidine) was absolutely required to maintain patency. Following withdrawal of the antiplatelets, unfractionated heparin (UFH) was titrated to an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 1.5 times greater than the control value. Maintenance UFH (800 U.h-1) was continued until the time of arrival in the operation room (activated clotting time (ACT) was 166 seconds). One hour after arrival, reduced dose of UFH (200 U.h-1) was reinfused, and ACT was 121 140 seconds. Hemodynamic change was minimized using balanced general anesthesia (nitrous oxide-isoflurane, fentanyl, midazolam and vecuronium) accompanied by nitroglycerin and diltiazem. There was no ischemic change on ECG or transesophageal echocardiography. Following surgery, the UFH dose was augmented (400 U.h-1), and the maintenance dose was attained 11 hours after surgery. HD on the second postoperative day was performed uneventfully. This hemodynamic stability might be come from the no water removal. Fourteen days after surgery, the patient was discharged without hemorrhagic complications or clinical ischemic events. We conclude that perioperative UFH infusion is not contraindicated for dialysis patient if strict ACT control is maintained."

CD008691,0,6371778,0,Exercise in the management and rehabilitation of selected chronic diseases.,"The effects of exercise on the progression of eight chronic diseases or medical conditions are reviewed. In the case of coronary artery disease (CAD), there is some suggestive evidence that exercise is associated with a survival advantage. Exercise does not consistently increase blood flow in peripheral vascular disease, nor does it improve lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, it is associated with increased physical work capacity in these two conditions. Preliminary studies suggest that exercise may be beneficial in the management of pulmonary secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis. Exercise has no therapeutic role in acute exacerbations of rheumatoid arthritis, but in the chronic stages, exercise that does not cause pain may be beneficial. Exercise is the focal point of chronic pain syndrome programs. With exercise programs, patients with chronic pain can increase physical work capacity with a decrease in complaints of pain. Patients with osteoporosis appear to benefit from a carefully programmed low-level exercise program that avoids back flexion exercises. Blood glucose, hypertension, and serum lipid levels improve with exercise in patients with dialysis-dependent renal failure."
CD008691,0,16780064,0,[Coronary artery bypass grafting to left anterior descending coronary artery diagnosed by multidetector-row computed tomography].,"A 64-year-old male received coronary angiography because of chest pain. Although coronary angiography showed total occlusion of right coronary artery (RCA) # 2 and left anterior descending branch (LAD) #6, and a significant stenosis of left circumflex (LCx) #11, it could not visualize LAD distal to LAD # 6. Since coronary multidetector-row computed tomography (MD CT) could visualize the distal LAD, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was indicated for this patient. Left internal thoracic artery (LITA) was anastomosed to LAD and saphenous vein graft (SVG) was used for distal anastomoses to obtuse marginal branch (OM) and 4-posterior descending branch (# 4 PD). Postoperative course was uneventful. LITA anastomosed to LAD and SVG to OM and # 4 PD were visualized by postoperative coronary angiography. MD CT in addition to coronary angiography was demonstrated useful to assess precise lesions of the coronary artery disease in this case."
CD008691,0,14638921,0,Association between renal insufficiency and inducible ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease: the heart and soul study.,"Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) is a predictor of stroke, cardiovascular, and all-cause mortality, but the mechanisms responsible for these associations are unclear. Whether CRI was associated with severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) as measured by exercise stress echocardiography among outpatients with stable CAD was evaluated. This study is a cross-sectional analysis of the Heart and Soul study, a prospective cohort of patients with known CAD. Renal function was assessed by 24-h urine collection, and CRI was defined as measured creatinine clearance < or =60 ml/min. Exercise stress echocardiography was used to identify inducible ischemia, defined as any wall motion abnormality seen at stress but not at rest. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of CRI with exercise-induced ischemia after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Participants with CRI composed 97 (23%) of the 431 participants and were characterized by older age, worse CAD, lower ejection fraction, greater left ventricular mass and higher C-reactive protein values. The prevalence of exercise-induced ischemia was also substantially greater in the participants with CRI (42% versus 23%; odds ratio [OR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 3.8; P < 0.001). This association was minimally changed by adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and coronary disease history (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.3; P < 0.01) and remained strong even after adjustment for C-reactive protein (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.0 to 5.1; P = 0.04). CRI is strongly associated with exercise-induced ischemia in patients with CAD. The greater severity of atherosclerotic disease observed in patients with CRI may in part explain the association of CRI with increased cardiovascular risk among individuals with CAD."

CD008691,0,11728948,0,Determinants of delayed nephrologist referral in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Late referral to nephrologists of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem because it is prevalent and associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and greater healthcare costs. To identify factors associated with delayed nephrologist referral (first nephrologist visit < 90 days before the onset of renal replacement therapy), we identified a cohort of patients with preexisting CKD that progressed to end-stage renal failure. We developed a logistic regression model to measure the association of specific demographic and clinical covariates with delayed nephrologist referral. Delayed referral was highly associated with older age (P < 0.001), race other than white or black (P = 0.002), and the absence of certain comorbidities: hypertension (P < 0.001), coronary artery disease (P < 0.001), malignancy (P = 0.005), and diabetes (P = 0.02). Associations of late referral with male sex (P = 0.07) and lower socioeconomic status (P = 0.09) were of borderline significance. Patients who were predominantly cared for by a general internist were more likely to be referred late to a nephrologist compared with those cared for by a family or primary care practitioner (P = 0.002) or another subspecialist (P = 0.019). These findings suggest that several factors increase the risk that patients with CKD will have the first nephrologist consultation excessively late in the course of their disease. Although timely access to nephrologist services is important for all patients with advanced CKD, this is of particular concern in older patients, those in certain minority populations, and those in whom the absence of comorbidity may provide a false sense of true risk status."

CD008691,0,3458343,0,[Pathologic decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity in relation to the development of hyperlipemias and their significance for coronary heart disease].,"There is much evidence that altered lipid metabolism contributes to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). It is generally accepted that there is a direct association between the extent of CAD and total plasma cholesterol, as well as an inverse association between the extent of CAD and plasma HDL-cholesterol. No general agreement exists about the atherogenetic potential of plasma triglycerides and of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Since lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the key-enzyme in the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins), we examine the relationship between triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and LPL in vitro and in vivo. The concentrations of the main lipoprotein density classes, namely very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins2 (HDL2) and HDL3, are measured by rate zonal ultracentrifugation. The preparation of VLDL, IDL, LDL, HDL2, and HDL3 is performed by sequential ultracentrifugation. The activity of LPL is measured radioenzymatically in a glycerol-based triolein emulsion. It can be demonstrated in vitro that VLDL, IDL, and HDL2 from normal plasma are able to increase LPL-activity in contrast to VLDL, IDL, and HDL2 from hyperlipemic plasma. This difference seems to be caused by an altered composition of apolipoproteins in hyperlipemic lipoproteins. An artificial acidosis in three healthy subjects shows in contrast to alkalotic and neutral blood-pH a significant decrease of LPL-activity. This result seems to be of some interest, since diseases associated with acidotic blood-pH, such as chronic renal disease, diabetes mellitus or chronic alcoholism, show secondary hyperlipemias caused by a deficit of LPL-activity. It can be shown in 15 male patients who produce a secondary type-V hyperlipemia during severe abuse of alcohol, that LPL-activity is decreased significantly as compared to 15 healthy controls. During sober phases, this alcohol-induced hyperlipemia and the impairment of LPL-activity disappears completely. In an other group of 8 male patients, who are not producing severe secondary hyperlipemia during approximately the identical alcohol intake, LPL-activity is also significantly decreased, but the activity of hepatic lipase is significantly increased. This increase of the activity of hepatic lipase seems to protect these patients from the development of secondary type-V hyperlipemia. In 89 male patients with angiographically assessed CAD a very strong inverse association between the activity of LPL and the extent of CAD is found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD008691,0,10090349,0,"Blood pressure and the risk of complex arrhythmia in renal insufficiency, hemodialysis, and renal transplant patients.","Complex arrhythmia is frequent in hemodialysis patients but it is not clear if this is a consequence of dialysis or uremia or is secondary to the hemodynamic and cardiovascular alterations often associated with chronic renal failure. The incidence of complex ventricular arrhythmia (frequent multiform premature beats, couplets, and runs) in 31 subjects who had their uremic status recently corrected by renal transplant (Group 1) and in 23 predialysis (Group 2) and 73 hemodialysis (Group 3) chronic renal failure patients were studied with 24-h Holter monitoring. Patients were not receiving antiarrhythmic drugs or digitalis and significant coronary artery disease was excluded by clinical and noninvasive methods. Complex arrhythmia was two times more frequent in dialysis patients but the difference did not reach statistical significance (Group 1: 16%; Group 2: 17%; Group 3: 34%; chi2 4.9, P = .086). The stepwise model of logistic regression analysis identified systolic blood pressure (odds ratio 1.015, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.001-1.027, P = .03) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (odds ratio 7.04, 95% CI 1.3-36.7, P = .02) as the only factors that independently influenced the probability of complex arrhythmia. Age, gender, race, diabetes, smoking status, body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, hematocrit, left ventricular mass index, and use of diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, sympatolytics, and calcium channel blockers did not influence the occurrence of complex arrhythmia. The data indicate that blood pressure and myocardial dysfunction are more important determinants of complex arrhythmia than dialysis or uremia in chronic renal disease patients."

Of 101 segments with initial perfusion abnormality, concordant findings were observed after Tl reinjection in 67 segments (66%). But redistribution (RD) after Tl reinjection was observed in 19 of the 52 persistent defect (PD) segments (37%), and complete RD was observed 15 of the 43 segments (35%) where 3 hr scan showed incomplete RD. On the other hand, concordant findings were observed on 24 hr delayed scan in 11 of the 20 segments with perfusion abnormality (55%). RD on 24 hr delayed scan was observed in 5 of the 13 PD (38%), but it was not apparent in 3 of the 7 segments where 3 hr scan showed RD. Furthermore the segments which showed RD after Tl reinjection in PD segments tend to have less severe RWM abnormality than the sustained PD segments (RWM score: 1.65 +/- 1.17 vs. 2.29 +/- 1.05, p less than 0.05).

CD008691,0,8803638,0,Revascularization of the ischemic diabetic foot using popliteal artery inflow.,"Between March 1988 and June 1994, 35 popliteal to distal artery vein bypasses were done in 32 diabetic patients. There were 16 males and 16 females with an average age of 60 years. Eighteen patients (56%) had insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Medical risk factors included coronary artery disease (CAD) in 15 (47%), hypertension in 15 (47%), chronic renal failure (CRF) in 9 (28%), and cigarette smoking in 10 (31%). Indications for revascularization were: non-healing ulcerations in 18 (51%), gangrene in 15 (43%), and rest pain in 2 (6%). The distal anastomosis was to the posterior tibial artery in 9, anterior tibial artery in 8, dorsalis pedis artery in 10 and peroneal artery in 8 cases. All the bypasses were done with autogenous saphenous veins (in-situ 11, reversed 17, and free non-reversed 7). The limbs were graded into three groups based on the preoperative angiographic evaluation of their pedal arch: patent arch (Grade ""0""), partial occlusion of the arch (grade ""1.5"") and little or no arch visualized (Grade ""3""). Eight limbs had Grade ""0"", 16 had Grade ""1.5"" and 11 had Grade ""3"" pedal circulation. Bypass follow up was done by clinical exam and color duplex surveillance (CDS) for a mean duration of 24 months. CDS identified 4 failing bypasses which were surgically revised and have subsequently remained patent. There were 3 bypass occlusions which resulted in a major amputation in 2 patients. Three additional major amputations were performed for persisting infection despite a patent bypass. By life table analysis the cumulative primary & secondary patency and limb salvage rates for this group of diabetic patients were 75% at 2 years, 89% at 3 years and 82% at 3 years respectively (S.E. < 10%). The 3 bypass occlusions, which occurred at 1 week, 5 weeks, and 20 months, were in patients with both CRF and Grade ""3"" foot circulation (significantly different outcome compared to the rest of the group, by chi 2 test, p < 0.05). Good results can be achieved in the majority of diabetic patients undergoing short popliteal-distal bypasses. However, the combination of chronic renal failure and very limited foot circulation (Grade ""3"") has a significant adverse outcome."

Retrospective analysis of 108 patients who underwent coronary angiography over a 3-year period in a single institution. A troponin I level of 0.1 ng/mL or higher was considered abnormal troponin I. Renal insufficiency was defined as creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL or higher. Obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) was defined as luminal diameter reduction of 70% or more (or total occlusion) in at least 1 coronary artery. Patients were divided into group 1 (renal insufficiency without need for hemodialysis, n = 76, mean age = 65) and group 2 (patients requiring hemodialysis, n = 32, mean age = 60). Access Accu TnI method was used to quantitate cTnI where murine monoclonal antibodies specifically bind to the C-terminal end of cTnI. In group 1, 41 (54%) patients had abnormal troponin of whom 37 (90%) had CAD and 4 (10%) had normal angiogram; 35 (46%) patients had normal troponin, of whom 25 (71%) had CAD and 10 (29%) had normal angiogram yielding a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 71% (P = 0.003; 95% confidence interval).

All underwent coronary angiography (CA) and left ventriculography (LV). SPET images were obtained at rest and at peak exercise (Modified Bruce) 90 min after injection of 99Tcm-MIBI (650-850 MBq). Data were acquired in 30 min over 180 degrees (from 45 degrees RAO to 45 degrees LPO) with no correction for attenuation, using a 64 x 64 matrix. The presence of persistent (P) or reversible (R) perfusion defects (PD) was then correlated to the resting and exercise ECG and to the results of CA and LV. Of the 56 patients, 34 had reversible underperfusion (RPD), 46 persistent underperfusion (PPD) and 31 had both. The occurrence of RPD correlated well with the occurrence of exercise-induced ST segment depression and/or angina (27 patients of 34 patients, 79%) and with the presence of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) (33 of 44, 73%). In 45 of 46 patients (98%) PPD corresponded to akinetic or severely hypokinetic segments (LV) usually explored by ECG leads exhibiting diagnostic Q waves (42 of 46 patients, 91%).

CD008691,0,11172556,0,Medical and revascularization management in acute coronary syndrome in renal patients.,"Despite the high incidence of coronary artery disease in patients with renal impairment, its diagnosis and management remains difficult. The treatment of acute coronary syndrome in this particular group of patients is more complex than in patients with normal renal function. They have a high prevalence of asymptomatic cardiac ischemia. Abnormal baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) findings and nonspecific elevation of cardiac enzymes may be present. Studies are lacking regarding their management mainly because they have been excluded or were not studied as a subgroup in the clinical trials. Thrombolytics are underused during acute myocardial infarction. Heparin, mainly low-molecular weight heparin, for unstable angina and non-Q wave myocardial infarction, should be used with caution because the higher risk for bleeding. Other medications, such as aspirin, metoprolol, and nitroglycerin should be used as in the general population. The newer platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may need renal dose adjustment. Revascularization should be pursued if necessary by percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. However, the prognosis and risk of revascularization versus medical therapy have not been determined yet."

CD008691,0,12860215,1,Prognostic value of myocardial perfusion imaging in predicting outcome after renal transplantation.,"Cardiovascular disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after renal transplantation. Pretransplant screening in a subset of these patients for occult coronary artery disease (CAD) may improve outcome. The objective of this study was to examine the outcome of 600 patients after renal transplantation for end-stage renal disease. Prospective outcome data were collected on 600 consecutive patients who had renal transplantation between 1996 and 1998 at our institution at 42 +/- 12 months after surgery. Stress single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging was performed in 174 patients before surgery, 136 (78%) of whom had diabetes mellitus. There were a total of 59 events: 17 cardiac deaths, 14 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, and 28 noncardiac deaths. There were 12 cardiac events and 11 noncardiac deaths among those who had SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging. In a multivariate analysis that included important risk factors, age (p = 0.03 and 0.003, respectively) and diabetes (p = 0.02 and 0.005, respectively) were the predictors of total events and cardiac events in patients who did not undergo stress SPECT perfusion imaging. In the subgroup who had stress perfusion imaging, an abnormal perfusion SPECT study was the only predictor of cardiac events (p = 0.006). The 42-month cardiac event-free survival rate was 97% in patients with normal SPECT images and 85% in patients with abnormal SPECT images (RR 5.04, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 17.6, p = 0.006). Thus, there is a 2.8% event rate per year after renal transplantation, and approximately 50% of these events are noncardiac. In high-risk patients (most of whom had diabetes) with preoperative stress perfusion imaging, those with normal images had significantly lower cardiac events than those with abnormal images. These results have important implications in patient screening and postoperative management."
CD008691,0,15276092,0,Impact of chronic kidney disease on prognosis of patients with diabetes mellitus treated with percutaneous coronary intervention.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a frequent complication of diabetes mellitus. However, the role of CKD in outcomes of patients with diabetes who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been studied specifically. Therefore, we investigated the impact of CKD on prognosis of patients with diabetes who underwent PCI. Of 1,575 diabetic patients who underwent PCI, 1,046 (66%) had preserved renal function, 492 (31%) had CKD (baseline serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dl or estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) without dialysis, and 37 (2.3%) were dependent on dialysis. Patients with CKD versus those without CKD had more in-hospital complications, including mortality (2.6% vs 0.5%, respectively; p <0.0001), neurologic events (3.1% vs 0.6%, p = 0.0001), and gastrointestinal bleeding (2.9% vs 0.9%, p = 0.01). Contrast-induced nephropathy after PCI (increase > or =25% and/or > or =0.5 mg/dl of serum creatinine before PCI vs 48 hours after PCI) was found in 15% of patients without CKD versus 27% of those with CKD, and de novo dialysis was instituted in 0.1% versus 3.1%, respectively. Contrast-induced nephropathy was independently predicted (all p <0.0001) by peri-PCI hypotension (odds ratio [OR] 2.62), insulin treatment (OR 1.84), and volume of contrast medium (OR 1.30). The 1-year mortality rate was strikingly higher (all p <0.0001) in patients with CKD who did not receive dialysis (16%) and those on dialysis (44%) compared with the group with preserved renal function (5%). Contrast-induced nephropathy was among the independent predictors of a 1-year mortality rate (OR 2.75, p <0.001)."
CD008691,0,12358138,0,Prevalence and outcome of renal artery stenosis in atherosclerotic patients with renal dysfunction.,"We investigated the prevalence of renal artery disease and outcome in a cohort of atherosclerotic patients with renal dysfunction. We studied 44 consecutive patients who were older than 50 years of age, who had renal dysfunction and in whom one or more of the following atherosclerotic diseases was confirmed: cerebral infarction, coronary artery disease or peripheral vascular disease. Renal artery stenosis was assessed by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic-resonance angiography. Patients who were treated medically were prospectively followed up in our outpatient clinic and the impact of renal artery stenosis on survival was evaluated. Renal artery stenosis was found in 22 (50%) of the 44 patients. Difference in kidney length and carotid artery stenosis were identified as independent predictors of renal artery stenosis. Among the patients who were treated medically (n=42), rates of mortality were 4.4, 12.7 and 18.1 per 100 patient-years in those without renal artery stenosis, those with unilateral renal artery stenosis and those with bilateral renal artery stenosis, respectively. The mortality and renal survival curves were significantly different among these three groups. These findings indicate that renal artery stenosis is common in patients with renal dysfunction and concomitant cardiovascular disease, especially in those with carotid artery stenosis, and that a substantial difference in the length of kidneys may be a predictor of renovascular disease. Patients with renal dysfunction resulting from renal artery stenosis are at risk of death from cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal failure."

CD008691,0,9070553,0,Impact of diabetes mellitus on percutaneous revascularization (CAVEAT-I). CAVEAT-I Investigators. Coronary Angioplasty Versus Excisional Atherectomy Trial.,"We examined the relation between diabetes mellitus and outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization in the Coronary Angioplasty Versus Excisional Atherectomy Trial (CAVEAT-I), a randomized trial comparing treatment with either percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or directional atherectomy for de novo lesions in native coronary arteries. Acute success and complication rates, 6-month angiographic restenosis rates, and 1-year clinical outcomes were compared between diabetic and nondiabetic patients undergoing each procedure. Acute success rates between diabetic (n = 191) and nondiabetic (n = 821) patients were similar for both revascularization techniques. Except for the need for dialysis, complication rates were also similar. Six months after atherectomy, diabetic patients had significantly more angiographic restenosis than nondiabetics (59.7% vs 47.4%) and significantly smaller minimum luminal diameters (1.20 vs 1.40 mm). Diabetics undergoing atherectomy required more frequent bypass surgery (12.8% vs 8.5%) and more repeat percutaneous revascularizations (36.5% vs 28.1%) than nondiabetics undergoing atherectomy. Restenosis rates, minimum luminal diameters and repeat revascularizations between diabetics and nondiabetics undergoing angioplasty were similar. The higher restenosis and repeat revascularization rates and the smaller minimum luminal diameter at follow-up in diabetic patients suggest that atherectomy may provide only modest benefit for these patients. The increased restenosis rate in diabetics undergoing atherectomy (but not angioplasty) requires further evaluation."

CD008691,0,15110601,1,Cardiac evaluation for simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation and incidence of cardiac perioperative complications: preliminary study.,"Type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, and eligibility protocols for simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) are consequently accurate for preoperative cardiovascular assessment. According to our algorithm, coronary angiography in SPKT candidates is indicated for patients not only experiencing previous cardiac events or symptoms, but also those with long-standing diabetes (more than 25 years) and/or age over 45 years. Furthermore, a basal transthoracic echocardiographic exam (TTE) is performed to assess cardiac volumes, left ventricular mass, systolic function, and kinesis. The aims of this study were to evaluate perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality in 18 SPKT-eligible patients, divided into two groups on the basis of the presence/absence of angiographically evident coronary artery disease (CAD), as well as to assess the impact of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on cardiac complications. Cardiac intraoperative morbidity and mortality and postoperative mortality and major morbidity were absent; minor cardiac morbidity consisted only of silent ischemic ECG alterations, without significant differences between groups, although the incidence seemed to be higher in the CAD-positive population. LVH detected preoperatively by TTE exam also failed to correlate with the incidence of such complications. Selection of SPKT candidates by coronary angiography may have positive effects on perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality. A larger sample size is needed to give the study statistical power. Medium- and long-term follow-up studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of preoperative selection on survival rates."

CD008691,0,18528325,0,Myocardial fatty acid imaging identifies a group of hemodialysis patients at high risk for cardiac death after coronary revascularization.,"We prospectively evaluated if impaired myocardial fatty acid metabolism is involved in cardiac death after revascularization by percutaneous coronary artery intervention in dialysis patients. A cohort of hemodialysis patients was assessed by dual single-photon emission computed tomography using the radioiodinated fatty acid analogue BMIPP and radiolabeled thallium chloride. Tomography was done within one month before the first coronary intervention and at the last follow-up angiography at which neither restenosis nor de novo lesions were detected. Radiolabel uptake on tomography images was graded in segments and calculated as summed BMIPP or thallium scores. Among the 90 hemodialysis patients in the study, 19 died of cardiac events. Multivariate Cox hazard analysis found a significant association of cardiac death with the BMIPP summed scores at the last follow-up angiography. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed the cardiac death-free survival rates at 3 years of follow-up were significantly higher in patients with lower BMIPP summed scores. These results suggest that myocardial fatty acid imaging may be a useful test to identify high risk groups of cardiac death in hemodialysis patients."
CD008691,0,11172555,0,Diagnostic tools and management strategies for coronary artery disease in patients with end-stage renal disease.,"Patients with renal disease often have coexistent coronary artery disease (CAD). The 5-year survival rates are < 50% and cardiovascular disease accounts for nearly half of the deaths in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis. Renal disease is often caused by hypertension or diabetes mellitus, both very strong risk factors for the development of CAD. Other patients develop hypertension after the onset of their renal disease. These coexistent diseases partially contribute to the increased incidence of CAD in the renal patient. Managing physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion and interpret the results of diagnostic studies with this high pretest probability in mind. Consideration should be given for screening for the presence of ischemic heart disease in patients with ESRD and no symptoms, especially if being considered as renal transplant recipients. It remains most important to adequately treat the associated risk factors and specifically, aggressively control the blood pressure. This report discusses the known and suspected reasons for the highly associated coexistent CAD, methods for diagnosing and risk-stratifying CAD, and renal-specific guidelines for appropriate treatment."

CD008691,0,19783341,0,Cardiovascular risk assessment among potential kidney transplant candidates: approaches and controversies.,"Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death after kidney transplantation. However, uncertainties regarding the optimal assessment of cardiovascular risk in potential transplant candidates have produced controversy and inconsistency in pretransplantation cardiac evaluation practices. In this review, we consider the evidence supporting cardiac evaluation in kidney transplant candidates, generally focused on coronary artery disease, according to the World Health Organization principles for screening. The importance of pretransplant cardiac evaluation is supported by the high prevalence of coronary artery disease and the incidence and adverse consequences of acute coronary syndromes in this population. Testing for coronary artery disease may be performed noninvasively by using modalities that include nuclear myocardial perfusion studies and dobutamine stress echocardiography. These tests have prognostic value for mortality, but imperfect sensitivity and specificity for detecting angiographically defined coronary artery disease in patients with end-stage renal disease. Associations of angiographically-defined coronary artery disease with subsequent survival also are inconsistent, likely because plaque instability is more critical for infarction risk than angiographic stenosis. The efficacy and best methods of myocardial revascularization have not been examined in large contemporary clinical trials in patients with end-stage renal disease.

CD008691,0,19575083,0,Echocardiographic assessment of left atrial size in patients with end-stage renal disease.,"Cardiac disease is the most common cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease. It is assumed that the high rate of cardiovascular mortality is related to accelerated atherosclerosis. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency have an increased prevalence of coronary artery disease, silent myocardial ischaemia, complex ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy, annular mitral and aortic valve calcification, and enlargement of the left atrium, than patients with normal renal function. It is also well known that haemodialysis is associated with cardiovascular structural changes and rapid fluctuations in electrolyte levels. In this study, we sought to estimate left atrial size by means of echocardiography and to determine any correlations between different echocardiographic measurements in patients with end-stage renal disease."

CD008691,0,10221467,0,Constrictive pericarditis and pleuropulmonary disease linked to ergot dopamine agonist therapy (cabergoline) for Parkinson's disease.,"Cabergoline is one of several ergoline dopamine agonist medications used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). We diagnosed constrictive pericarditis (CP) in a patient with PD receiving cabergoline therapy (10 mg daily), who had symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure (CHF). In the absence of previous reported cases of this condition linked to ergoline drugs, cabergoline was not initially identified as the cause. Shortly thereafter, however, the patient developed of a severe pleuropulmonary inflammatory-fibrotic syndrome, a recognized complication of ergoline medications, thus suggesting a common pathogenesis due to cabergoline therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the English literature, although we speculate that CP may be more common than reported among patients with PD who are treated with an ergoline drug (cabergoline, bromocriptine, pergolide, or lisuride). The diagnosis of CP is difficult and requires a high level of suspicion; symptoms may masquerade as CHF due to common mechanisms such as coronary artery disease. In patients with PD who are taking not only cabergoline but also one of the other ergoline drugs, CP should be suspected if symptoms of CHF develop."
CD008691,0,20024639,0,Troponins and high-sensitivity troponins as markers of necrosis in CAD and heart failure.,"For years, cardiac troponins (cTn) have been regarded as the preferred biomarkers for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and for the risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndromes, as well as for the selection of patients who need an early invasive strategy, and for the guidance of adjunctive pharmacological therapy. In addition, measurement of cTn has been found useful for detection of myocardial necrosis in conditions unrelated to myocardial ischemia including acute pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, heart failure, sepsis, and end-stage renal disease. In these conditions, an unfavorable prognosis is unequivocally associated with detectable concentrations of cTn.A major limitation of most currently available cTn assays is the lack of adequate precision, i.e., to measure cTn concentrations at the 99th percentile value with a coefficient of variation < 10%. As a consequence, many manufacturers have developed more sensitive cTn assays that now comply with precision criteria required by the Joint European Society of Cardiology/ American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/World Heart Federation Task Force for the Redefinition of Acute Myocardial Infarction.Using assays with higher analytic sensitivity more patients will be seen in clinical practice with the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (TnThs) above the 99th percentile discriminator. The causes of these elevations may be due to acute, subacute and chronic cardiac disease such as heart failure or cardiomyopathies."

CD008691,0,17699457,0,"Kidney function, electrocardiographic findings, and cardiovascular events among older adults.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with cardiovascular (CV) disease and mortality. It is not known whether cardiac rhythm disturbances are more prevalent among individuals with CKD or whether resting electrocardiogram findings predict future CV events in the CKD setting. Data were obtained from the Cardiovascular Health Study, a community-based study of adults aged >/=65 yr. After exclusions for prevalent heart disease, atrial fibrillation, implantable pacemaker, or antiarrhythmic medication use, 3238 participants were analyzed. CKD was defined by an estimated GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Outcomes were adjudicated incident heart failure (HF), incident coronary heart disease (CHD), and mortality. Participants with CKD had longer PR and corrected QT intervals compared with those without CKD; however, differences in electrocardiographic markers were explained by traditional CV risk factors and CV medication use. After adjustment for known risk factors, each 10-ms increase in the QRS interval was associated with a 15% greater risk for incident HF (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.27), a 13% greater risk for CHD (95% CI 1.04 to 1.24), and a 17% greater risk for mortality (95% CI 1.09, 1.25) among CKD participants. Each 5% increase in QTI was associated with a 42% (95% CI 1.23 to 1.65), 22% (95% CI 1.07 to 1.40), and 10% (95% CI 0.98 to 1.22) greater risk for HF, CHD, and mortality, respectively. Associations seemed stronger for participants with CKD; however, no significant interactions were detected. Resting electrocardiographic abnormalities are common in CKD and independently predict future clinical CV events in this setting."

CD008691,0,3960242,0,Exercise training reduces coronary risk and effectively rehabilitates hemodialysis patients.,"This study examines the effects of 12 months of endurance exercise training (cycling, walking and jogging) on lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, blood pressure, anemia and psychological function in 14 hemodialysis patients. Maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) increased 18% in the exercisers (p less than 0.01), but did not change in 11 controls. This was associated with a reduction in depression, a decrease in dosages of antihypertensive medications, a significant increase in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels (red cell mass rose, plasma volume did not change), a decrease in plasma triglyceride by 23% (p less than 0.05) and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels by 21% (p less than 0.01) (both HDL-C and triglyceride levels worsened in the sedentary controls), and an 18% increase in glucose disappearance rates (p less than 0.05) in spite of a 52% decrease in fasting insulin levels (p less than 0.01), suggesting that insulin sensitivity improved. These results demonstrate that some of the complications present in hemodialysis patients may be caused by their sedentary life-style, rather than endstage renal disease itself. This suggests that rehabilitation through exercise is possible for these patients. By reducing coronary risk factors in hemodialysis patients, exercise training may also decrease their heightened morbidity and mortality from atherosclerotic complications. These possibilities need to be examined in a longitudinal study."
CD008691,0,18589097,1,Technetium myocardial perfusion scanning in prerenal transplant evaluation in the United kingdom.,"Because death with a functioning graft remains one of the most important causes of long-term renal transplant failure, cardiac risk stratification and screening for coronary artery disease are essential components of pretransplant assessment. Pretransplant screening for occult coronary artery disease in a subset of these patients may improve outcome. The UK follows the European Best practice guideline 1.5.5 E. Although echocardiography, thallium myocardial perfusion scanning (MPS), dobutamine stress echocardiography, and coronary angiography have been suggested as means of cardiovascular assessment, the best means of assessment remains undetermined. Therefore, we investigated the role of 99m technetium sestamibi myocardial perfusion scanning as an assessment tool for identifying those patients with end-stage renal failure at high risk of cardiovascular death after renal transplantation. Retrospectively, we studied 126 patients that had a MPS as part of their pretransplant assessment. Overall unadjusted survival was 65% at 3 years. Twelve deaths resulted from cardiovascular causes. A reversible defect on MPS was associated with a fatal cardiac event and all-cause mortality. The unadjusted hazard ratio of cardiac event with reversible defect on MPS was 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 18.2) and hazard ratio of death with reversible defect on MPS was 1.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 4.4). Thus, MPS may be a useful tool in cardiac risk stratification and in selecting patients with a favorable outcome after renal transplantation. Our patients with a reversible defect in particular have increased cardiac mortality. This group may benefit from coronary angiography."

CD008691,0,16188511,0,Impact of renal function on coronary plaque morphology and morphometry in patients with chronic renal insufficiency as determined by intravascular ultrasound volumetric analysis.,"The aim of the present study was to use intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) to assess plaque morphology and morphometry in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal insufficiency, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis replacement. Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death for patients with chronic renal insufficiency, particularly in patients with ESRD. The impact of several degrees of renal insufficiency (including ESRD) on coronary plaque characteristics has not been determined. A total of 142 patients who underwent IVUS imaging of a de novo native coronary artery stenosis before percutaneous intervention were matched for age, gender, and diabetes and were grouped according to calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl): CrCl >70 ml/min (n = 39); CrCl 50 to 69 ml/min (n = 41); CrCl <50 ml/min, (n = 37), and ESRD (n = 25). Standard clinical, angiographic, and IVUS parameters were measured. The ESRD group had more African-American (p = 0.002) and hypertensive (p = 0.002) patients. No significant difference was found in any of the IVUS measurements among patients with CrCl >70, 50 to 69, and <50 ml/min: reference and lesion site arterial, lumen, and plaque areas and volumes, and arterial calcium (p = NS for all comparisons). Conversely, patients with ESRD had larger reference segment arterial and lumen areas and volumes; larger lesion site arterial, lumen, and plaque areas; and larger arcs of calcium (p <0.05 for all post hoc comparisons between patients with ESRD and patients with CrCl >70, 50 to 69, and <50 ml/min). Thus, chronic renal insufficiency in the absence of dialysis is not associated with increased reference segment or lesion site plaque burden and calcium. However, the transition to the need for dialysis is associated with progressive calcific atherosclerosis (larger lesion plaque area and calcium)."

All major systemic arteries were affected, large vessels more severely than smaller ones, and within each artery the changes were most pronounced in the proximal part of the vessel. The intimal lesions consisted primarily of smooth muscle cells without calcification or lipid accumulation. A reduction of the lumen exceeding 50% of the normal cross sectional area was not seen and mural thrombosis was not encountered. In the media, degenerative changes with increased amounts of proteoglycans and calcifications were prominent, but foci of increased cellularity were also seen. There was no evidence of lipid accumulation in the media either. Similar changes were found in the coronary arteries, but coronary angiography revealed no irregularities or stenosis. The calcified medial degenerative changes and intimal cellular lesions without lipid accumulation in non-cholesterol-fed rabbits distinguish uremic arterial disease from atherosclerosis."

CD008691,0,20649758,0,Prognostic study of cardiac and renal events in Japanese patients with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular risk using myocardial perfusion SPECT: J-ACCESS 3 study design.,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. Recent studies have indicated that the incidence of cardiovascular disease increases inversely with estimated glomerular filtration rate. Although coronary angiography is considered the gold standard for detecting coronary artery disease, contrast-induced nephropathy or cholesterol microembolization remain serious problems; therefore, a method of detecting coronary artery disease without renal deterioration is desirable. From this viewpoint, stress myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) might be useful for patients with chronic kidney disease. We recently performed the Japanese Assessment of Cardiac Events and Survival Study by Quantitative Gated SPECT (J-ACCESS) investigating patients with suspected or extant coronary artery disease and the J-ACCESS 2 study of patients with diabetes. The findings from these studies showed that SPECT can detect coronary artery disease and help to predict future cardiac events. Thus, we proposed a multicenter, prospective cohort study called ""J-ACCESS 3"" in patients with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular risk. The study aimed at predicting cardiovascular and renal events based on myocardial perfusion imaging and clinical backgrounds. We began enrolling patients in J-ACCESS 3 at 74 facilities from April 2009 and will continue to do so until 31 March 2010, with the aim of having a cohort of 800 patients.

CD008691,0,17417765,0,Incidence and risk factors of coronary artery disease in patients on chronic hemodialysis.,"Aim of the study was to estimate the incidence of coronary heart disease (CAD) in patients (pts) with end stage renal disease (ESRD) maintained on chronic hemodialysis (HD) and its association with the presence of predisposing factors. The study included 171 dialysis pts (107 male (M) and 64 female (F)). Mean age of pts was 67+/-13 years, mean time on dialysis 52.7+/-44 months and Body Mass Index (BMI) 25.9+/-3.7 kg/m2. Fifty pts (29.2%) were clinically diagnosed with CAD. The diagnosis was established by coronary angiography in 24 (48%) and in 26 by combined dipyridamole-exercise thallium imaging (52%). Pts' data in association with the development of CAD that were recorded included age, sex, smoking habits, hypertension, obesity, the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, anemia, low albumin levels, secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHP), the presence of chronic inflammation, as evidenced by the presence of elevated levels of CRP and hyperhomocysteinemia. There was a statistically significant association of increasing age and CAD (p<0.0001). Relative risk (RR) was significantly increased i) in male pts compared to female pts (RR: 8.56, p<0.001), ii) in anemic pts compared to pts with hemoglobin levels< or =11 g/dL (RR: 8.26, p<0.0001), iii) in obese pts compared to pts with BMI < or =30 (RR: 5.09, p<0.005) and iv) in pts with increased levels of homocysteine compared to pts with levels of homocysteine <15 |IM (RR: 4.14, p<0.0001). Using linear regression analysis, CAD was associated with the inadequacy of HD (r = - 0.05, p<0.0001), time on HD (r =0.04, p =0.012) and increasing age (r =0.24, p<0.001).

Two groups were compared: a group with normal renal function (n = 909) and a group with CRI (creatinine >/=1.5 mg/dL and clearance of </=30 mL/min, as well as dialysis and transplant patients, n = 102). Mean age was significantly higher in CRI patients (71.22 vs. 68.33 years, p = 0.001). The incidence of smokers was 53.9% in the non-CRI group vs. 39.2% in CRI patients (p = 0.005). Hypertension (88.2% vs. 75.1, p = 0.003) and cardiac disease (58.8% vs. 47.4%, p = 0.029) were more common in the CRI group. The perioperative mortality rate was significantly higher in CRI patients (3.9% vs. 1.0%, p = 0.013). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between CRI and 30-day death rate (odds ratio = 3.76, p = 0.032). In this series, CRI patients presented an increased mortality. The mortality risk may be related to the increased rates of preoperative hypertension and coronary disease and perioperative myocardial infarction.

We developed a simple method to connect a hemofiltration machine to the cardiopulmonary bypass system. To evaluate the benefit of intraoperative hemofiltration, 124 consecutive patients (mean age, 67 +/- 6 years) with moderate renal dysfunction were studied. Surgery was preformed between January 2005 and May 2007. On-pump coronary artery bypass with hemofiltration was carried out in 40 patients (group A), 44 had on-pump coronary artery bypass without hemofiltration (group B), and 40 had off-pump coronary artery bypass (group C). Postoperative acute renal failure was defined as either renal failure requiring dialysis or >or=50% decline from the baseline glomerular filtration rate but not requiring dialysis. The 3 groups had similar demographic data and preoperative renal function. After adjusting for covariates and propensity scores, multivariate analysis showed that intraoperative hemofiltration and off-pump surgery protected postoperative renal function. Independent risk factors for postoperative renal dysfunction were age >70 years, left ventricular ejection fraction <35%, and the preoperative glomerular filtration rate."
CD008691,0,16895685,0,[Atherosclerosis and the kidney].,"Diffuse atherosclerosis entails a 15-30% risk of plaques on renal arteries (ARAS), with a correlation with coronary atherosclerosis. Ischemia induces generation of angiotensin II (Ang II) that maintains sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the tuft to preserve the GFR. Ang II inhibition suppresses this protective mechanism. In fact, any antihypertensive drug may lead to reaching a ""critical perfusion pressure"". ARAS should be suspected in case of renal asymmetry. It should also be envisaged in case of ""flash pulmonary edemas"". Ultrasonography and renal tomography show aortic calcifications and often the outline of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Tomodensitometry may detect large aorto-renal plaques. Spiral scanner tomography represents a progress, in terms of renal artery imaging and of renal cortical atrophy. Magnetic resonance imaging is less accurate but avoids iodine toxicity. The best noninvasive method is pulsed echo-doppler. It is particularly useful for evaluating stenoses progression. Some stenoses progress to renal atrophy and renal artery thrombosis, whereas others follow a stable course. Pulsed Doppler helps predict whether revascularization will improve renal function, according to the resistance index. Renal arteriography entails a high risk of cholesterol crystal embolism. However, it is the obligatory first step for angioplasty and stent positioning, indicated when the kidney is not atrophic. The indication for revascularization essentially depends on evaluation of the benefits vs risks of angioplasty or surgery. Some publications underscore the frequent stability of renal function and the fact that, revascularized or not, most patients will shortly die of myocardial infarction. Renal cholesterol crystal embolism (CCE) is a severe condition, which occurs when large arteries undergo surgery, aortography or interventional radiology. Anticoagulants are a frequent cause of CCE. CCE may also occur spontaneously, resulting in slowly progressive renal insufficiency. Migration of crystals in small caliber intrarenal arteries induces obstruction, followed by an inflammatory reaction. The clinical picture resembles angiitis, with laboratory evidence of inflammation along with high eosinophil counts and hypocomplementemia. Diagnosis rests on: 1) a iatrogenic event in a patient with an atherosclerotic background; 2) examination of the skin disclosing purple toes, small necrotic lesions and livedo of the lower limbs. Crystals may also be found by funduscopy. Skin or muscle biopsy are contributive in showing crystals and help avoid renal biopsy; 3) other localizations involve the mesenteric circulation and the central nervous system. Until recently, the prognosis was considered disastrous. However, a recently published treatment schedule proved efficient in reducing mortality. A last issue regarding the relationships between atherosclerosis and the kidney deserves mention. In an autopsy-based study it was shown that atherosclerosis per se is accompanied by an increase in the glomerular surface area along with a greater proportion of obsolescent glomeruli by comparison with matched controls. Finally, it should be recalled that atherogenic hyperlipidemia usually aggravates the course of any renal disease, including ARAS. Treatment with statins is indicated in all forms of atherosclerotic renal disease."
CD008691,0,19101228,0,Relation of serum fetuin-A levels to coronary artery calcium in African-American patients on chronic hemodialysis.,"Vascular calcium deposition in end-stage renal disease occurs commonly, but its relation to cardiovascular risk factors and fetuin-A levels in African Americans is not known. Compliant African American patients who were undergoing hemodialysis (HD; n = 17) agreed to undergo 64-slice multidetector computed tomography for the assessment of coronary artery calcium score (CACS). The relation between traditional cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., age; gender; dialysis vintage; history of diabetes; means of the previous 3 years of weekly predialysis blood pressure values and hemoglobin levels; means of monthly values of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, uric acid; and albumin; and means of quarterly measurements of parathyroid hormone and lipids) and fetuin-A levels and CACS was explored using univariate analyses. Serum phosphorus levels over the previous 3 years were well controlled. The CACS range was 0 to 3,877 Agatston units (mean 996, median 196). Among the tested variables, only fetuin-A was significantly and inversely associated with CACS (standardized beta = -0.64, 95% confidence interval -18.09 to -3.62, p = 0.006). There was no association between age and fetuin-A level (standardized beta = -0.02, 95% confidence interval -0.10 to 0.23). In conclusion, African-American patients who were undergoing long-term hemodialysis and with good phosphorus control exhibited a strong inverse correlation between fetuin-A level and CACS that was independent of age."

CD008691,0,3830201,0,Aortic valve orifice equation independent of valvular flow intervals: application to aortic valve area computation in aortic stenosis and comparison with the Gorlin formula.,"An orifice equation is derived relating the effective aortic valve area, A, the average aortic valve pressure gradient, dP, the stroke volume, SV, and the heart frequency, FH, through considerations of momentum conservation across the aortic valve. This leads to a formula consistent with Newton's second law of motion. The form of the new equation is A = (7.5 X 10(-5)) SV FH2/Pd, where A, VS, FH and Pd are expressed in cm2, ml, s-1 and mmHg, respectively. Aortic valve areas computed with the new orifice equation are found to correlate with those computed by the Gorlin formula in conditions of resting haemodynamic states at a level of r = 0.86, SE = 0.25 cm2, N = 120. The results suggest that the new formula may be considered as an independent orifice equation having a similar domain of validity as the Gorlin formula. The new equation offers the possibility of deriving additional useful haemodynamic relationships through combination with established cardiological formulas and applying it in a noninvasive Doppler ultrasonic or echocardiographic context."
CD008691,0,10926109,0,Cardiac complications of end-stage renal disease.,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients receiving dialysis. This is attributed in part to the shared risk factors of cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal disease. The risk factors for coronary artery disease include the classic cardiac risk factors of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking. Also in this population, hyperparathyroidism, hypoalbuminemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, elevated levels of apolipoprotein (a), and the type of dialysis membrane may play a role. Management begins with risk factor modification and medical therapy including aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents. Revascularization is often important, and coronary artery bypass grafting appears to be preferable to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. This is especially true for those with multivessel disease, impaired left ventricular function, severe symptoms, or ischemia. Congestive heart failure is another common problem in dialysis patients. The management includes correction of underlying abnormalities, optimal dialysis, and medical therapy. Data obtained from the general population indicate obvious benefits from ACE inhibitors and beta blockers, and these agents would be considered the therapies of choice. Erythropoetin is also an essential component of therapy, but the ideal hemoglobin concentration has yet to be determined. Peritoneal dialysis may be helpful in severe cases of heart failure. Pericarditis is seen in less than 10% of dialysis patients and is best diagnosed by clinical examination and echocardiography. Intensive dialysis is often the best initial therapy. Pericardiocentesis is reserved for the setting of pericardial tamponade, but a pericardial window is more definitive."
CD008691,0,10467215,0,Elevated systolic blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular and renal disease: overview of evidence from observational epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials.,"The effect of elevated blood pressure on risk of cardiovascular and renal disease has been documented in both observational epidemiologic studies and clinical trials. However, these studies have traditionally concentrated on diastolic blood pressure to characterize the risk associated with hypertension. We reviewed evidence from prospective studies and randomized controlled trials to quantify the risk associated with systolic blood pressure. Prospective studies and randomized controlled clinical trials that were published in English-language journals were retrieved using MEDLINE, bibliographies, and the authors' reference files. All retrieved publications were reviewed and information on sample size, duration, study design, antihypertensive medication, participant characteristics, and outcomes was abstracted for randomized controlled trials that reported systolic blood pressure reduction during intervention. Several prospective studies indicate that the association between systolic blood pressure and risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and end-stage renal disease is continuous, graded, and independent. Furthermore, they suggest that the association of systolic blood pressure with these outcomes is stronger than that of diastolic blood pressure. Pooling of the data available from randomized controlled trials indicates that an average reduction of 12 to 13 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure over 4 years of follow-up is associated with a 21% reduction in coronary heart disease, 37% reduction in stroke, 25% reduction in total cardiovascular mortality, and 13% reduction in all-cause mortality rates. These data indicate that systolic blood pressure is an independent and strong predictor for risk of cardiovascular and renal disease."

CD008691,0,15384711,0,Accelerated graft disease in a composite saphenous vein with internal thoracic artery in a chronic renal dialysis patient.,"A 59-year-old man with 18-year history of renal dialysis due to chronic nephritis suffered coronary artery disease, which was complete occlusion of the right coronary artery and diffuse 90% stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery. Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting was performed. Saphenous vein (SV) was anastomosed with left internal thoracic artery (ITA) as a T-graft. Left ITA was anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery. The end of SV was sewn on the posterior descending artery. Coronary and graft angiography performed 2 weeks after the operation showed good patency with good distal run-off of both left ITA and SV. Three months after the operation, he was admitted with unstable angina. Angiography revealed accelerated SV graft stenosis without any change of prior coronary disease. However, angiography 7 months after the operation revealed complete obstruction of the SV graft when he was admitted because of recurrent anginal pain."
CD008691,0,9575401,1,Prognostic value of dipyridamole thallium-201 screening to minimize perioperative cardiac complications in diabetics undergoing kidney or kidney-pancreas transplantation.,"To minimize perioperative cardiac events, we utilize a screening protocol consisting of intravenous dipyridamole thallium-201 myocardial imaging (DPT), with the selective use of coronary angiography based on the presence of reversible defect(s) on DPT test. A retrospective study was performed to determine the prognostic value of this protocol and to identify any clinical parameters predictive of an abnormal DPT test. To accomplish this, a detailed chart analysis of 176 consecutive kidney (n = 89) and kidney-pancreas (n = 87) transplant recipients who had undergone pretransplant DPT testing was performed. The results of the DPT test were interpreted as normal in 111, fixed defect in 15, and reversible defect(s) in 50 patients. Forty-two of the 50 patients with reversible defect(s) underwent coronary angiography. Twelve of the 27 patients with significant coronary artery disease (CAD, > 50% stenosis in one or more coronary arteries) underwent pretransplant revascularization and the remaining 15 were treated medically. Cardiac events (documented acute myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death) within 6 wk of transplant were stratified by the results of this protocol. Also, various clinical parameters were compared between patients with normal and abnormal (fixed and reversible defect) DPT tests. Only one of the 111 (0.9%) transplant recipients with a normal DPT test had a perioperative cardiac event. None of the 15 (0%) patients with a fixed defect and none of the 15 (0%) patients with reversible defect(s), but a nonsignificant (< 50% narrowing) coronary angiogram, had a perioperative cardiac event. Three of the 27 (11.1%) patients with reversible defect(s) and significant disease on coronary angiography, who had undergone pre-transplant revascularization or were managed medically, had a perioperative coronary event. Of 14 recipients parameters analyzed, age > 50 yr was the only variable predictive of an abnormal DPT test. We conclude that the incidence of perioperative cardiac events in patients with a normal or fixed defect, or reversible defect(s) but a nonsignificant (< 50% narrowing) coronary angiogram is very low, indicating the high correlation of these findings on DPT and an uneventful (cardiac) post-transplant course. The incidence of perioperative cardiac complications amongst the high-risk transplant recipients with reversible defect(s) and significant CAD on coronary angiogram may be minimized by appropriate preoperative medical management or revascularization. None of the clinical variables except age > 50 yr was predictive of an abnormal DPT test."
CD008691,0,8277603,0,[Study of washout rate in patients with chronic renal failure by dipyridamole 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy--comparison with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy].,"Fourteen patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) were studied by dipyridamole 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy. In this study, patients with coronary heart disease were excluded by clinical findings. 201Tl SPECT was performed at 8 min after injection of dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg) and at a 3-hr delayed interval, and washout rates (WR) were calculated. Because UCG showed left ventricular hypertrophy (thickness; 13 +/ 2 mm) in CRF, the WR values were compared with those of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (n = 9). In CRF, an average WR was 54.2 +/- 6.8% and was significantly higher than that in normal (46.2 +/- 9.1%, p < 0.05, n = 9), though WR in HCM was significantly low (26.9 +/- 11.4%, p < 0.01). Hematocrit value was 24.5 +/- 3.2% in CRF and was significantly lower than that in normal (37.8 +/- 3.6%, p < 0.001). On the other hands, hemoconcentration was observed in HCM (hematocrit; 44.6 +/- 3.6%, p < 0.001). WR in CRF, HCM and normal had significant correlation with hematocrit values (r = -0.796, p < 0.001). These results suggest that anemia or hemoconcentration may affect coronary blood flow and WR, and this should be considered when diagnosing coronary heart disease in CRF or HCM."

CD008691,0,18716364,0,Serum osteoprotegerin as a screening tool for coronary artery calcification score in diabetic pre-dialysis patients.,"Although cardiovascular disease is a principal cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), it is often asymptomatic in diabetic patients. The coronary artery calcification score (CACS) measured by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is useful for screening ischemic heart disease in the general population. We investigated which clinical parameters predict high CACS in predialysis diabetic nephropathy (DN). Participants were 85 patients with DN. Nobody had any history of coronary angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery. We measured blood counts, blood chemistry, bone alkaline phosphatase, intact-PTH, interleukin-6, osteoprotegerin (OPG), hemoglobin A1c, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and fetuin-A. CACS and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured by a single 16-slice MDCT and DEXA, respectively. The median value of CACS equaled 256 Agatston units (range 0-4494 units). Stepwise increase in CACS with CKD stage progression was observed (p<0.01 for trend). Simple regression analyses showed that Log (CACS+1) was positively correlated with age, systolic blood pressure, phosphorus and OPG. In addition, it was negatively correlated with nutritional parameters, such as body mass index, albumin, total-cholesterol and 25(OH)D. Fetuin-A and BMD had no impact on CACS. Multiple regression analyses showed that low albumin and high OPG were associated with high CACS. The sensitivity of OPG for detecting CACS>200 was 80%, when the cut-off value was 1.2 ng/mL. In conclusion, CACS increased with CKD stage progression in predialysis DN patients. Serum OPG was positively associated with high CACS and can be a useful screening tool for severe coronary calcification, whereas no association between fetuin-A and CACS was found."

CD008691,0,16968482,0,Steroid-free immunosuppression regime reduces both long-term cardiovascular morbidity and patient mortality in renal transplant recipients.,"The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the impact of steroid therapy on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and patient mortality, in 486 on-CsA renal transplant recipients, with a follow-up of 9.5 +/- 4.3 yr. Two hundred and one patients had their steroids permanently withdrawn at sixth month after transplantation (G1); 285 patients did not (G2) as they were unable (acute rejection after suspension) or unsuitable (because of clinical criteria or immunosuppressive protocols). The CVD considered were coronary artery disease diagnosed by angiography and myocardial infarction. G1 and G2 patients were well-matched regarding CVD risk factors, except for age (G1: 44 +/- 14 yr; G2: 40 +/- 12 yr; p < 0.003), incidence of male (G1: 62%; G2: 72%, p < 0.02) incidence of acute rejection (G1: 39%; G2: 83%, p < 0.0001). Both CVD and deaths occurring during the first year of transplantation were excluded from the analysis. At 20 yr, the cumulative probability of developing a CVD, was 3.8% in G1; 23.8% in G2 (p < 0.0005). Patient survival rate was 95% in G1; 62% in G2 (p < 0.003). Mortality caused by CVD was higher in G2 (4.2% vs. 0.5%; p < 0.03). The Cox analysis identified in steroid therapy the main independent risk factors for both CVD (hazard ratio 9.56 p < 0.0001) and patient mortality (hazard ratio 5.99, p < 0.0001). At 10th and 15th year after transplantation, the mean-daily dose of steroids was 4.2 mg. In the long-term, steroid therapy, even in low-doses, increases significantly both the rate of CVD and patient mortality. This retrospective study suggests that steroid-free regime should always be recommended for the prevention of post-transplant CVD. This relevant statement should be followed by a long-term prospective study."

CD008691,0,20576827,0,Effect of kidney disease on acute coronary syndrome.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent worldwide and is associated with an increased risk for adverse outcomes in patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In studies including thousands of patients admitted with myocardial infarction, CKD consistently determines a poorer prognosis for ACS patients. In contrast with CKD, information about the effect of acute kidney injury (AKI) on clinical outcomes after ACS is limited. Most data come from retrospective registry databank studies of nonconsecutive patients with a significant number of patients excluded from analyses. There are no prospective studies designed to determine whether AKI strictly diagnosed by the new the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) or RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) criteria is a risk factor for death after ACS, and there are no data comparing the RIFLE and AKIN criteria for AKI diagnosis after myocardial infarction. This article reviews the most important data on CKD and ACS and the available data on AKI and ACS. The importance of obtaining an early serum creatinine level after admission for ACS and the importance of renal function monitoring during hospitalization are stressed."
CD008691,0,19775319,0,Evolution of coronary artery calcifications following kidney transplantation: relationship with osteoprotegerin levels.,"We prospectively assessed the evolution of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels after renal transplantation (RT). Eighty-three recipients were followed-up prospectively during 1 year. Blood was collected before (baseline) and after RT for determination of mineral metabolism parameters including OPG. CAC was measured by multidetector computed tomography at transplantation (baseline) and 1 year later. Progression of CAC was defined as a difference between the follow-up square-root transformed volume (SRV) and the baseline SRV >or= 2.5. By multivariate analysis, baseline OPG level, age and low LDL levels were significantly associated with baseline CAC. RT was accompanied by mineral metabolism improvement with a decrease of OPG from 955 [395-5652] to 527 [217-1818] pg/mL and parathyroid hormone from 94 [1-550] to 62 [16-410] pg/mL. Thirty-one percent of patients did not exhibit CAC at baseline. CAC diminished in 14.5%, stabilized in 59.2% and progressed in 26.3% of patients. Baseline CAC was associated with progression (OR 2.92 [1.02-8.36]). No significant association was found between OPG and CAC progression despite a higher baseline OPG level in progressors (1046 [456-3285]) vs. non-progressors (899 [396-5952] pg/mL). CAC at baseline, but not 1 year after RT, is independently associated with baseline OPG; posttransplant CAC progression is predicted by baseline CAC score."

A number of studies suggest that similar pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for development and progression of calcification of atherosclerotic plaque and bone formation. Fetuin-A is a potent calcification inhibitor and is expressed in bone, with not-yet well-defined functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between bone mineral densitometry parameters, coronary artery calcification, and serum fetuin-A levels. In a cross-sectional design, we included 72 maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Serum fetuin-A levels were studied both in maintenance HD patients and healthy controls. Maintenance HD patients had radius, hip, and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and coronary artery calcification score (CACS) measured by electron-beam computed tomography. The associations between site-specific BMD parameters, CACS, and serum fetuin-A levels were studied in maintenance HD patients. CACS, mass, and volume of plaques in coronary arteries were significantly higher in patients with a T-score below -2.5 than above in the proximal region of the radius, neck and trochanter of the femur, and the lumbar spine. Mean serum fetuin-A concentration was 0.636 +/- 0.118 g/L in maintenance HD patients and it was less than healthy controls (0.829 +/- 0.100 g/L, P < 0.0001). CACS, mass, and volume of plaques in coronary arteries correlated significantly with the serum fetuin-A levels. Moreover, significant positive correlations were shown between the serum fetuin-A levels, BMD values, and T-scores of proximal radius, neck, and trochanter of the femur, but not with the lumbar spine. The present study demonstrates an association between serum fetuin-A levels, coronary artery calcification, and bone mineral densities--except for the lumbar spine, in maintenance HD patients. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because of the cross-sectional design of the study."

CD008691,0,11406912,0,Aetiology and treatment of hyperhomocysteinaemia causing ischaemic stroke.,"Recent studies have shown that hyperhomocysteinaemia is a common, independent and easily modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic and thromboembolic diseases such as cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease and venous thrombosis. The vascular risk rises continuously across the spectrum of elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations. It is at least as important as cholesterol, lipoprotein abnormalities and hypertension and should be part of risk assessment, especially those at high risk. Moderately elevated plasma homocysteine concentration is readily correctable by folic acid, betaine, or vitamin B12 supplementation. It seems logical to assume that a reduction in homocysteine concentration will reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke, but there are as yet no published data to prove this. This review will discuss the aetiology and possible treatment of hyperhomocysteinaemia causing ischaemic stroke."

Also reviewed is the emerging database indicating that statins may modulate renal function by altering the response of the kidney to dyslipidemia."
CD008691,0,2226509,1,Cardiac evaluation of candidates for kidney transplantation: value of exercise radionuclide angiocardiography.,"In view of the high incidence and mortality of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with kidney transplantation, a systematic cardiac evaluation was prospectively performed in 103 uraemic patients eligible for transplantation. After clinical examination, 28 patients with symptoms of CAD or diabetes mellitus were referred directly for coronary angiography, whereas the remaining 75 patients had rest and exercise radionuclide angiocardiography for evaluation of possible asymptomatic CAD. Among them, left ventricular ejection fraction was below 40% at rest or fell during exercise by at least 5 EF% in 12 patients; coronary angiography in nine showed CAD in four and hypertensive heart disease in five. In the remaining 63 (of 75) patients without severe resting left ventricular dysfunction or exercise ischaemia, the follow-up of 28 +/- 7 months revealed no clinical manifestation of CAD. Overall incidence of CAD in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients during a follow-up of 27 months after cardiac evaluation was 20 and 25% in nondiabetic and diabetic candidates for kidney transplantation, respectively (P = n.s.). Thus, clinical examination combined with exercise radionuclide angiocardiography in patients without signs or symptoms of heart disease had a high predictive accuracy for presence or absence of late manifestations of CAD. Exercise radionuclide angiocardiography is therefore a useful method for screening kidney transplantation candidates for asymptomatic CAD."

Forty-five patients underwent Holter ECG monitoring for a continuous 48-hour period covering dialysis and the intermediate period of everyday activity at home. ECG criteria for ischemia were found in 15.5% of patients mainly during and immediately after dialysis with a simultaneous increase of R,S,R + S amplitude. There was no correlation of S-T segment deviation with the existence of cardiac dysfunction and coronary artery disease proved by hemodynamic and angiographic studies.

CD008691,0,15291295,0,Sternal osteomyelitis complicating percutaneous coronary artery stenting.,"Hematogenous sternal osteomyelitis is a rare infection that has been associated with i.v drug abuse and blunt thoracic trauma, but iatrogenic infections have also been described following resuscitation and in conjunction with hemodialysis catheters. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common causative organism. Stenting is the preferred treatment for isolated stenosis of the coronary artery and is associated with a low complication rate and high patency rate. Such intravascular procedures are rarely complicated by infections. A 72-year-old man developed hematogenous sternal osteomyelitis following coronary artery stenting. Radiological diagnosis was made using CT scan and MRI, and blood cultures and aspiration fluid from the infected soft tissue were positive for S. aureus. Initial therapy consisted of i.v. second-generation cephalosporin followed by oral cephalexin and later linezolid. Prolonged antibiotic therapy without surgical intervention was successful in controlling this rare complication.

CD008691,0,9738122,0,Minimally invasive left anterior descending coronary artery revascularisation in high-risk patients with three-vessel disease.,"We reviewed our experience over a 12 month period with using minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) for the management of high-risk patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease. Twenty patients (4 females, mean age 67 years) received left internal mammary artery (LIMA) grafts to the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Associated co-morbidity included: severe chronic renal failure, severe extensive arteriopathy, chronic obstructive airway disease, poor general condition and severely impaired left ventricular function. There was one early postoperative mortality and no other cardiac-related morbidity. Graft patency investigated, using angiography was 90%, and 5 patients underwent follow-up angioplasty to other coronary arteries. All patients remain entirely angina free at a follow-up period between 3 and 12 months. We conclude that MIDCAB is a safe and effective approach for managing high-risk patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease."

CD008691,0,12694316,0,Morphology of the heart and arteries in renal failure.,"In patients with renal failure, cardiovascular complications are a major clinical problem; cardiac death is the main cause of death in these patients. Cardiac risk is increased by a factor of 20 in uremic patients, compared with matched segments of the general population. It has been known for a long time that atherosclerosis, particularly plaque in the epicardiac coronary conduit arteries, are more frequent in patients with chronic renal failure. Recently, however, clinical studies showed that myocardial infarction is responsible for only 30% to 50% of all cardiac deaths. In contrast, 30% to 40% of patients with renal failure and ischemic heart disease show patent coronary arteries on coronary angiogram. Thus, it is very likely that in uremic patients myocardial ischemia tolerance is markedly reduced even in the absence of classical atherosclerosis (i.e., relevant stenosis of coronary arteries). This finding in uremic patients can be at least partially explained by structural and metabolic abnormalities of the myocardium, and in part by alterations of the extracardiac vasculature. The present paper focuses on structural changes of the heart and the vasculature, in particular on atherosclerosis of cardiac and extracardiac arteries, and its potential repercussions for cardiovascular function. In 1827 Richard Bright already pointed to the common presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and thickening of the aorta in patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRF). At present, cardiovascular complications account for 45% of all deaths in uremic patients [1]. The recent report of Herzog, Ma, and Colins [2] documented a 59.3% 1-year mortality rate in dialyzed patients who survived myocardial infarction (i.e., mortality was significantly higher than in the general population). It is widely acknowledged that several specific structural and nonstructural alterations of the heart and the extracardiac vasculature are present in patients with renal failure, which presumably contribute to the markedly increased cardiovascular risk in these patients [3]."
CD008691,0,19886337,0,Assessing cardiovascular disease in the dialysis patient.,"Cardiac causes account for nearly half of all deaths in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Coronary artery disease (CAD) is present in 38% - 40% of patients starting dialysis. Both traditional and chronic kidney disease-related cardiovascular risk factors contribute to this high prevalence rate. In patients with ESRD, CAD--particularly acute myocardial infarction--is underdiagnosed. Dobutamine stress echocardiography and, to a lesser extent, stress myocardial perfusion imaging have proved useful in screening for CAD in such patients. Coronary artery calcium scoring is less useful. Acute myocardial infarction is associated with high short- and long-term mortality in dialysis patients. Cardiac troponin I appears to be more specific than cardiac troponin T or CK-MB in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction."
CD008691,0,19886334,0,Utility of echocardiography in the evaluation of coronary artery disease in patients with end-stage renal disease.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of cardiovascular events. Echocardiography is an integral part of the evaluation of coronary artery disease. Chronic kidney disease has a predictable and unique effect on the myocardium and the epicardial circulation that may be detected by echocardiography. In particular dobutamine stress echocardiography has proved to be an invaluable tool in the detection of cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD. Here, we review the usefulness of echocardiography in the detection and evaluation of coronary artery disease in patients with CKD."
CD008691,0,7986481,0,Noninvasive cardiac testing in the end-stage renal disease patient.,Renal transplant candidates are at increased risk for future cardiac death--approximately 5-10% per year. Invasive testing by coronary angiography has been used to assess the cardiac risk. However this is expensive and carries its own risks to residual renal function as well as cardiac morbidity and mortality. Screening of patients by clinical risk factors may obviate the need for invasive or noninvasive testing in a significant number (approximately 50%) of the renal transplant candidates. Further noninvasive testing with exercise or dipyridamole thallium-201 stress testing in the high-risk patients may be a more cost-effective screening test than coronary angiography. Other noninvasive testing modalities may also prove useful in the future but have not yet been proven in this unique patient population. The characterization of a renal transplant candidate's cardiac risk may assist the clinicians in prioritizing the candidate for transplantation. Recent evidence also suggests that revascularization of the diabetic renal transplant candidate with significant coronary artery disease (which is approachable by angioplasty or bypass surgery) may modify their cardiac risk. Randomized studies of the efficacy of revascularization or medical therapy interventions in the nondiabetic renal transplant candidate with coronary artery disease have not been performed.

CD008691,0,17679817,0,High cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes and the cardiometabolic syndrome: mandate for statin therapy.,"Diabetes mellitus confers a high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and requires aggressive management of all cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetic dyslipidemia. Although levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are often normal or only slightly elevated in persons with diabetes, lipid-altering therapy with statins has been shown in large, randomized, controlled trials to decrease the risk of cardiovascular complications in this patient population. A target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of <70 mg/dL is now a therapeutic option in patients at very high risk for coronary heart disease, including patients with diabetes. Diabetes is also a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. In addition to their lipid-modifying effects, statins have been shown to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy and potentially exert other renoprotective effects; these benefits, however, remain to be confirmed in clinical trials."

CD008691,0,15793624,0,Posterior descending coronary artery flow reserve assessment by Doppler echocardiography in children with and without congenital heart defect: comparison with invasive technique.,"To evaluate whether transthoracic Doppler echocardiography can reliably measure coronary flow velocity and coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) in the posterior descending coronary artery (PD) in children, we examined 32 patients who had congenital heart disease (ventricular septal defect in 10, tetralogy of Fallot in 6, tricuspid atresia in 3, double-outlet right ventricle in 2, patent ductus arteriosus in 2, and aortic valve stenosis in 2) and 7 patients who had a history of Kawasaki disease without stenosis or aneurysm formation of the coronary artery. Average peak flow velocity (APV) in the PD was measured by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography at the time of intracoronary Doppler study. CFVR was defined as the ratio of hyperemic to basal APV. Clear envelopes of basal and hyperemic APV in the PD were obtained in 23 of 32 patients by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography. APV obtained from transthoracic Doppler echocardiography correlated highly with that from the Doppler guidewire method (r=0.91). The mean difference between transthoracic Doppler echocardiography and the Doppler guidewire method was 0.1+/-2.9. There was an excellent correlation between transthoracic Doppler echocardiography and the Doppler guidewire method for the measurements of CFVR (r=0.84). The mean difference between transthoracic Doppler echocardiography and Doppler guidewire was -0.016+/-0.198. Noninvasive measurement of coronary flow velocity and CFVR in the PD using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography accurately reflects invasive measurement of coronary flow velocity and CFVR by the Doppler guidewire method in pediatric patients with various heart diseases."
CD008691,0,19088537,0,Right atrial intramural hematoma associated with aortic dissection.,"A 75-year-old male presented with shortness of breath and abdominal pain; he had undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery three months ago and had a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a right atrial mass. A computed axial tomography scan showed an atrial mass and type A aortic dissection. The patient sustained cardiorespiratory arrest and died. An autopsy showed an 8 cm atrial intramural hematoma originating from a dissecting aneurysm. This is the first case of right atrial intramural hematoma associated with aortic dissection exhibiting high mortality. Early diagnosis using multiple imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging and timely surgical intervention may improve survival. Intramural hematomas should be considered in patients presenting with right-sided cardiac lesions."

Bare metal stent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has significantly reduced restenosis and subsequent target lesion revascularization in these patients, although not to the level of non dialysis controls. The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) has dramatically reduced restenosis rates compared with bare metal stents (BMS) in patients with various clinical and angiographic characteristics, however their impact on patients with ESRD on dialysis is unclear due to consistent exclusion of this population from major trials. The purpose of this study was therefore to compare the outcomes of PCI with DES and BMS when used for ESRD patients on dialysis, by meta analytical techniques."

It is shown that cardiac troponins have decreased diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in patients receiving renal replacement therapy. Data regarding serum levels of these cardiac biomarkers, especially those of the cardiac troponins, in patients with a transplanted kidney are limited. Current data show that levels of cardiac troponin I are unaltered in patients who have undergone renal transplantation, while levels of cardiac troponin T may be elevated.We believe that cardiac troponin I should be the biomarker of choice for diagnosis of myocardial injury in these patients. However, further trials are required for conclusive results."
CD008691,0,18086692,0,Early and mid-term results of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with end stage renal disease: surgical outcomes after achievement of complete revascularization.,"End stage renal disease is a risk factor for mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting. We conducted a retrospective review of 37 consecutive dialysis-dependent patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting between April 2001 and July 2004. Complete revascularization was successfully performed in all patients. The mean number of anastomoses was 3.7, and early graft patency was 98.8%. Thirty-day mortality was 2.7%. In-hospital mortality was 8.1%. At a mean follow-up of 26 months, there were six late deaths including one cardiac death, and five cardiac events. Actuarial survival rate at one and three years was 88.8% and 77.0%, respectively. Cardiac event free rate at one and three years was 85.9% and 72.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (P=0.003) and smoking history (P=0.026) were significant predictors for mid-term mortality, and co-existing peripheral vascular disease was a significant predictor for cardiac events (P=0.033). Early and mid-term outcomes after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with end stage renal disease have acceptable mortality rate with excellent early graft patency, while low ejection fraction and smoking history were significant risk factors for mid-term survival, and co-existing peripheral vascular disease was a significant predictor for cardiac events."

CD008691,0,17224890,0,Impact of chronic kidney disease and diabetes on percutaneous coronary intervention outcomes.,"Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and chronic kidney disease (CKD) complicate treatment and outcomes for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Likely causes of the complicating effects of diabetes include hyperglycemia, abnormalities of microvascular perfusion, and a prothrombotic and proinflammatory state. CKD predisposes to atherosclerosis, adds to the mortality and morbidity risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and increases risks for patients undergoing PCI. The complexity of the renal dysmetabolic syndrome and its close association with CVD must be taken into account when developing a therapeutic plan for these patients. Clinical data support the use of abciximab for patients with disturbances of glucose metabolism or with CKD who are undergoing PCI. The use of drug-eluting stents reduces the rate of target vessel revascularization and restenosis."

CD008691,0,8604709,0,Electron beam computed tomography in the evaluation of cardiac calcification in chronic dialysis patients.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the value of electron beam computed tomography in the detection of cardiac calcifications in coronaries and valves of dialysis patients and to determine the rate at which calcification progresses. Forty-nine chronic hemodialysis patients aged 28 to 74 years were compared with 102 non-dialysis patients aged 32 to 73 years with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, all of whom underwent coronary angiography. We used high-resolution electron beam computed tomography scanning to make 30 axial slices with a distance of 3 mm between each slice. The number of calcifications, the surface area, and the average and highest density values were measured. We calculated a quantitative coronary artery calcium score and assessed calcification of mitral and aortic valves. In dialysis patients, the measurements were repeated after 12 months. The coronary artery calcium score was from 2.5-fold to fivefold higher in the dialysis patients than in the non-dialysis patients. Hypertensive dialysis patients had higher calcium scores than non-hypertensive dialysis patients (P < 0.05). A stepwise, multiple regression analysis confirmed the importance of age and hypertension. No correlation between calcium, phosphate, or parathyroid hormone values and the coronary calcium score was identified; however, the calcium score was inversely correlated with bone mass in the dialysis patients (r = 0.47, P < 0.05). The mitral valve was calcified in 59% of dialysis patients, while the aortic valve was calcified in 55%. The coronary artery calcium score was correlated with aortic valvular, but not mitral valvular calcification. A repeat examination of the dialysis patients at an interval of 1 year showed a disturbing tendency for progression. Our data under-score the frequency and severity of coronary and valvular calcifications in dialysis patients, and illustrate the rapid progression of this calcification. Finally, they draw attention to hypertension as an important risk factor in this process."

Reports on arterial aneurysms in other locations have not been conclusive. The present study was initiated to investigate the prevalence of coronary aneurysms. Thirty ADPKD patients who had undergone coronary angiography on clinical indication were identified, 15 after renal transplantation. For each ADPKD patient, a control patient was identified with end-stage renal disease, investigated by coronary angiography, and matched for age, sex, and time relation to transplantation. All angiograms were retrieved and reevaluated with respect to aneurysms, defined as an increase in artery diameter by 50% or more, as well as to pathologic ectasias not fulfilling this criterion. Aneurysms were detected in four ADPKD patients and two control subjects. Five more ADPKD patients, but none of the control subjects, had minor ectasias. One ADPKD patient had a dissecting aortic aneurysm, and another died of aortic dissection during bypass surgery.

This study was designed to determine whether the severity of preprocedural renal failure influences the outcomes of patients with renal failure undergoing PCI. We compared the immediate and long-term outcomes of 192 patients with mild renal failure (creatinine 1.6 to 2.0 mg/dl, mean 1.76) with those of 131 patients with severe renal failure (creatinine >2.0 mg/dl, mean 2.90), selected from 3,334 consecutive patients undergoing PCI between 1994 and 1997. Although the overall population with renal failure represents a high-risk group, the severe renal failure cohort had a higher incidence of hypertension, multivessel disease, prior coronary bypass surgery, vascular disease, and congestive heart failure (all p values <0.05), yet had similar angiographic characteristics. Procedural success was higher in the group with severe renal failure (93.7% vs 87.7%, p = 0.04). There were no statistically significant differences in in-hospital mortality (11.5% vs 9.9%, p = 0.7), Q-wave myocardial infarction (0.5% vs 0%, p = 0.4), emergent bypass surgery (0% vs 0%, p = 1.0), and in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (11.5% vs 9.9%, p = 0.7) between the mild and severe renal groups, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed no statistically significant difference in long-term survival (log rank test, p = 0.1) or event-free survival (log rank test, p = 0.3) between the 2 groups. Finally, creatinine was not identified as an independent predictor of in-hospital or long-term follow-up major adverse cardiac events. In our high-risk population, patients with mild renal insufficiency undergoing PCI experience major adverse outcomes in the hospital and at long-term follow-up similar to those of patients with severe renal failure."

Amoxycillin was started. Ten days later he was admitted to hospital because of persistent high fever, cervical adenopathy, erythema of the pharynx and tongue and lip fissuration. The most important interventions of his first hospitalization were endotracheal intubation because of increasing dyspnoea due to adult respiratory distress syndrome and haemodialysis for renal insufficiency. His admission to our hospital was marked by the echocardiographic discovery of giant coronary aneurysms in the first few centimeters of both right and left coronary arteries. Coronary angiography confirmed giant aneurysm formation of the right and left coronary arteries. Similarly, medium sized arteries (cerebral, hepatic, mesenteric, iliac) presented abnormalities and laboratory findings. This is the first description of adult-onset Kawasaki disease with giant coronary aneurysm formation and more generalized arterial involvement. The severity of the clinical symptoms and the severity of the coronary disease indicates that Kawasaki disease of the adult does not always have a benign course."

CD008691,0,12522700,0,Optimal operative strategies in repair of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms.,"In an effort to identify preoperative and perioperative factors impacting outcome in repair of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (JRAAA), hospital records and CT scans (for calcification, intraluminal thrombus, and aortic diameter) of all patients undergoing JRAAA repair over the past 10 years were reviewed. The 87 men and 25 women had a mean age of 72, and a mean maximal aortic diameter of 6.2 cm. Renal artery stenosis (RAS) and iliac disease were present in 13 (11%) and 40 patients (35%), respectively. Comorbidities included coronary artery disease (n = 49, 44%), COPD (n = 28, 25%), diabetes mellitus (n = 10, 9%), and preoperative renal insufficiency (PRI; Cr >1.4 mg/dL; n = 14, 12%). A midline incision was used in most of the patients (n = 98, 88%). The proximal aortic clamp was placed in the supraceliac (SC) position in 92 (82%) patients, and directly above one or both renal arteries in 20 (18%) patients. The overall mortality was 6% (n = 7). Cardiac complications occurred in 26 patients (23%); pulmonary, in 22 (20%); renal, in 14 (12%); and gastrointestinal, in 10 (9%). No patient experienced mesenteric ischemia. Mean elevation in creatinine was greater in patients with PRI (1.8 mg/dL vs. 0.13 mg/dL, p = 0.04). Mean blood loss (EBL) was 2701 +/- 189 cc, and mean LOS was 16.1 +/- 1.7 days. Age >70 was associated with increased length of stay (LOS) (12.1 days vs. 18.6 days, p = 0.05) and higher mortality (0 vs. 10%, p = 0.02); otherwise there were no significant relationships between pre- and perioperative parameters and any of the measured outcomes including death, postoperative RI, and LOS. Preferential SC clamping may substantially reduce complications of JRAAA repair (such as mesenteric and renal ischemia) related to proximal cuff disease, but cannot overcome the deleterious affects of advanced age and PRI."

CD008691,0,12584890,0,[Hyperhomocysteinemia--a risk factor for development of occlusive vascular diseases].,"Occlusive vascular diseases take the first places on lists of diseases in general population today. In spite of this, all risk factors which contribute to development of these diseases are not yet known. Recent studies have shown that homocysteine plays a critical role in it and is established as a new risk factor. WHAT IS HOMOCYSTEINE?: Homocysteine is a sulfur containing amino acid formed in the metabolism of methionine. Reference values of homocysteine in circulation and different forms in plasma are described. HYPERHOMOCYSTEINEMIA--A RISK FACTOR: Homocysteine was associated with atherosclerosis and occlusive vascular disease in 1960s for the first time. Since then, many studies--prospective and retrospective, have confirmed the role of hyperhomocysteinemia as a risk factor in 42% of patients with cerebrovascular disease, 28% with peripheral vascular and 30% with coronary artery disease. The Physician's Health Study, a prospective study in which 15,000 male physicians took part, revealed that increase in homocysteine concentration of 1.7 mumol/l above normal values was associated by threefold higher risk for myocardial infarction. The risk for carotid artery stenosis also increases with elevation of homocysteine concentration. Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with poor prognosis in patients with angiographically established coronary disease. Stroke, venous thromboembolism, and atherosclerosis in chronic renal failure are some of the complications of hyperhomocysteinemia."

After a 12-month follow-up, the incidence of CIN was 8.3% (n = 5) in patients with mild renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 60-89 mL/min per 1.73 m²), 34.4% (n = 10) in those with moderate renal insufficiency (eGFR 30-59 mL/min per 1.73 m²), and 100% (n = 3) in those with severe renal insufficiency (eGFR 15-29 mL/min per 1.73 m²). The sensitivity was 81.8% and specificity was 90.9% at the cutoff level of serum cystatin C >1.18 mg/L. Serum cystatin C levels were significantly (P < .001) higher in the patients with moderate renal insufficiency in the CIN group than those in the non-CIN group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that baseline serum cystatin C independently predicted short-term mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.311; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.058-0.538; P = .026).

CD008691,0,6862803,0,Variations in the blood supply of the left ventricular apex.,"Contraction or perfusion abnormalities of the left ventricular apex are generally assumed to result from left anterior descending (LAD) artery disease since this vessel is the usual source of blood supply to this area of myocardium. Such an assumption may be erroneous since the left ventricular apex may be supplied by the LAD alone, both the LAD and posterior descending (PD) branch of the right coronary artery, or the PD alone. Blood supply of the left ventricular apex was prospectively studied angiographically in 431 adult patients. In 77.7%, the apex was totally supplied by the LAD. In 12.1%, the apex received dual blood supply from both the LAD and PD. In 10.2%, the LAD terminated well before the apex, which was totally supplied by the PD. With the latter two anatomic variations, the LAD tended to be shorter and smaller in caliber than usual, while the PD was longer and larger than usual. A short, narrow LAD therefore does not necessarily indicate coronary disease if the left ventricular apex is partially or completely supplied by the PD. Dysfunction or perfusion abnormalities of the apex do not necessarily indicate LAD disease."

The 21 cases including 2 women and 19 men who underwent coronary angiography were retrospectively studied for age at transplantation and at diagnosis of coronary disease; risk factors; angio findings; serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values before and after angio; and revascularization procedures. The mean ages at transplantation and at diagnosis were 40 +/- 7 years and 44 +/- 7 years, respectively. Eighteen patients (86%) had hypertension, 16 (76%) exhibited hyperlipidemia, and 5 (24%) diabetes mellitus. Coronary angiography revealed three-vessel disease in 10 patients, two-vessel disease in 3 patients, one-vessel disease in 4 patients, ectatic vessels in 2 patients, and normal coronary arteries in 2 patients. The mean serum creatinine and BUN levels after angio were not significantly different from the baseline values (pre creatinine and BUN 1.7 +/- 0.5 mg/dL and 33.8 +/- 8.6 mg/dL versus post 1.8 +/- 0.6 mg/dL and 32.8 +/- 10.0 mg/dL, respectively). Ten patients with three-vessel disease underwent coronary artery bypass surgery; 4 patients, coronary angioplasty. The other patients received medical therapy. The study showed an increased likelihood of three-vessel disease among recipients compared with the general population and confirmed that coronary artery bypass surgery may be performed successfully in these patients. In conclusion coronary angiography is a safe diagnostic procedure with respect to allograft function."

It could be shown that coronary artery disease was underestimated by clinical symptoms, 55 per cent of patients had abnormal Tl-201 scintigrams, whereas typical or atypical chest pain was present in only 33 per cent of the patients. Eleven patients died within a year of the scintigraphic study, which resulted in an average mortality rate of 7.7 per cent/year. The risk of developing fatal cardiovascular complications was higher in patients with an abnormal Tl-201 perfusion (7 of 18) than in those with a normal scintigram (1 of 15). Thus nuclear medicine procedures appear to be of diagnostic value in haemodialysis patients, which in addition may have prognostic implications."

CD008691,0,19712254,0,Review article: Coronary artery stenoses: detection and revascularization in renal disease.,"Cardiovascular events are markedly elevated in those with all degrees of renal impairment compared to the general population. There are well established guidelines in the general population for the management of coronary artery disease, however, similar guidelines have not been established in the renal population. This review examines the current published work on the detection of coronary artery stenoses in addition to summarizing the outcomes of revascularization in patients with kidney disease. Testing for coronary artery disease in the renal population most commonly occurs in dialysis patients as part of their assessment for renal transplantation. While a positive myocardial stress test for the detection of significant coronary artery stenoses is associated with an increased risk of cardiac events, there is no clear information currently showing that cardiovascular testing itself reduces the rate of adverse cardiac events after transplantation. Revascularization of coronary artery stenoses is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in all groups with kidney disease than in the general population, with the exception of renal transplant recipients where the mortality is likely to be similar to that of the general population. There appears to be a benefit in coronary artery bypass surgery compared to percutaneous intervention in those on dialysis and after renal transplant. Currently, there is little data to support coronary artery intervention prior to transplantation in those with asymptomatic coronary artery disease."
CD008691,0,16871241,0,Risk factors for de novo acute cardiac events in patients initiating hemodialysis with no previous cardiac symptom.,"An initial major adverse cardiac event (MACE) is an important predictor of future cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We sought to identify factors influencing occurrence of initial MACE in new maintenance hemodialysis patients without previous cardiac symptoms during the predialysis phase of CKD. Among 112 participating patients with no predialysis cardiac history, 57 underwent coronary angiography, whereas the other 55 underwent stress thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography within 1 month of beginning hemodialysis to detect asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). In subsequent follow-up for a median of 24 months, subjects experiencing an initial MACE were compared with those who did not have such an event based on several clinical parameters at the end of predialysis phase. Asymptomatic CAD was present in 47 patients (42%), who had a higher cumulative MACE rate, than subjects without CAD (49 vs 3%, P<0.001). Multivariate Cox's regression analysis showed that three variables independently predicted initial MACE: asymptomatic CAD (hazard ratio or HR, 611.31; 95% confidence interval or CI, 14.07-26549.23; P<0.001), diabetes (HR, 20.41; 95% CI, 2.07-200.00; P=0.010), and each 1 mg/l increment in C-reactive protein (CRP) (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.27-2.94; P=0.002). In conclusion, detection of asymptomatic CAD, presence of diabetes, or elevated CRP at the end of the predialysis phase were significantly associated with occurrence of an initial MACE in CKD patients starting hemodialysis who had no CAD symptoms."
CD008691,0,7847356,0,A comparison of coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting outcomes in chronic dialysis patients.,"The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of angina, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac death, and all-cause death following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The study design was based on retrospective, nonrandomized analysis and was set in referral teaching hospitals and community hospitals. Eighty-four chronic dialysis patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease without prior revascularization were included in the study. Twenty-four patients underwent PTCA of one or more vessels, and 60 patients underwent CABG. Recurrence of angina, MI, cardiac death, and all-cause death following revascularization as well as the number of inpatient days preprocedure and postprocedure were recorded. The two patient groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, history of MI, left ventricular mass and function, and angina severity. Diabetes mellitus was more prevalent in the PTCA group. The CABG group had more severe coronary artery disease. The 2-year survival rate of the CABG patients (66%; 95% confidence interval = 53.79) did not differ from that of the PTCA patients (51%; 95% confidence interval = 27.65). Thirteen PTCA patients were restudied 106 +/- 108 days after recurrence of angina; nine (69%) of these patients were found to have angiographic restenosis. The postprocedure risk of angina and the combined endpoints of angina, MI, and cardiovascular death were significantly greater following PTCA than CABG. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was the only consistent predictor of outcomes; the adjusted relative risks (compared with CABG) of postprocedure angina and combined endpoints were 16.4 and 10.2, respectively, and were several-fold higher than the unadjusted risks. We conclude that in chronic dialysis patients with symptomatic coronary disease, patients undergoing PTCA have a higher risk of subsequent angina and combined angina, MI, and cardiovascular death than those undergoing CABG. The optimal approach to coronary revascularization in this patient population remains to be determined."
CD008691,0,2528654,0,Impact of left ventricular hypertrophy on survival in end-stage renal disease.,"We examined the prognostic significance of left ventricular hypertrophy determined by echocardiography in a cohort beginning renal replacement therapy. No patient had hemodynamically significant valvular disease or echocardiographic signs of obstructive cardiomyopathy. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, left ventricular hypertrophy was significantly associated with survival. The relative risk, based on comparison of upper and lower quintiles of left ventricular mass index, was 3.7 (95% confidence intervals, 1.6 to 8.3) for all-cause mortality and 3.7 (95% confidence intervals, 1.2 to 11.1) for cardiac mortality. The independent risk, adjusted for age, known coronary artery disease, diabetes, level of systolic blood pressure, and treatment (dialysis or transplantation), was 2.9 (95% confidence intervals, 1.3 to 6.9) for all-cause mortality and 2.7 (95% confidence intervals, 0.9 to 8.2) for cardiac mortality. Therefore, left ventricular hypertrophy appears to be an important, independent, determinant of survival in patients receiving therapy for end-stage renal failure."

CD008691,0,16437333,0,[Peritoneal dialysis and cardiopulmonary comorbidity].,"The number of patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) throughout the world continues to increase. The unacceptably high mortality in this population has led to current efforts to optimize dialysis treatment and has focused attention on comorbidities and their interaction with dialysis treatment. Cardiovascular morbidity is the most important cause of death in patients with ESRD. The advantages of hemodynamic stability and volume regulation offered by peritoneal dialysis (PD), compared with hemodialysis (HD), have made PD preferable for patients with cardiovascular comorbidity. However, recent studies on PD have shown a higher mortality in patients with coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure than in similar patients receiving HD. Nevertheless, the validity of the studies is limited by their retrospective study design and, furthermore, at the time of data collection, new dialysis solutions were not available and the percentage of patients on automated PD was low. Little is known about the frequency of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the ESRD population, but COPD data on the general population without kidney disease suggest that significant underestimation of both prevalence and mortality of this disease can be supposed in the ESRD population. Data currently available do not suggest that PD is contraindicated in patients with cardiac diseases. However, consequent diagnostic and therapeutic interventions of cardiac comorbidities and corresponding risk factors are required. Patients suffering from mild COPD should not be generally excluded from PD as renal replacement therapy, although individually tailored modifications of dialysate volume and frequency of exchanges are often required."

The preoperative examination showed renal dysfunction, BUN: 61.6 mg/ml, Cr: 21. mg/ml, 24 hr Ccr: 15.2 ml/min. At the operation, the fistula was closed from the inside of the pulmonary artery and MVR (27 SJM) and TAP (Kay-Reed method) were performed associated with the intra-operative hemodialysis.

A successful surgical repair of bilateral coronary artery-pulmonary artery fistula associated with valvular disease and severe renal dysfunction was reported."
CD008691,0,16437335,0,[Comparison of clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis].,"In addition to kidney transplantation, peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis represent two options for renal replacement therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Given that most patients are suitable for both types of dialysis and that many of them require lifelong therapy, differences in clinical outcome between these treatments are of major interest. Differences between the two dialysis treatments have been described in single clinical aspects (e.g., hyperkalemia, volume status, blood pressure control, cardiac complications), the relevance of which are reflected by mortality rates. Data available so far indicate that overall outcome of patients with ESRD is comparable in the two types of dialysis. However, there are significant differences in subgroups of patients, such as those with diabetes or coronary heart disease. In order to achieve the best possible survival and quality of life in ESRD, the optimal sequence of dialysis treatments during the course of renal replacement therapy, rather than a single type of treatment, has to be considered. The ""integrated care concept"" takes into account this sequence of dialysis treatments, suggesting that patients should start on PD but be transferred to hemodialysis as soon as PD is no longer adequate. This concept allows longer preservation of residual renal function, better early survival on dialysis and better short-term results of graft survival after kidney transplantation. Thus, if medically suitable, PD should be the first treatment option in patients with ESRD who need renal replacement therapy."

CD008691,0,6965831,0,Coronary-artery surgery in patients with end-stage renal disease.,"Between 1975 and 1979 we performed coronary arteriography on 15 patients with end-stage renal failure and clinical evidence of severe ischemic heart disease. One patient died after the procedure of severe pump failure. Ten patients subsequently received coronary-artery bypass grafts, and two of these patients also received mitral-valve replacement. One patient, a diabetic, died of sepsis after surgery. Eight of the nine surviving patients, including the two patients who had undergone mitral-valve replacement, are markedly improved as a result of surgery. Our experience indicates that these patients can undergo angiography and coronary-artery bypass surgery at an increased but acceptable risk, provided dialysis is done before and after cardiac catheterization and surgery to control extracellular volume overload and hyperkalemia. The operation benefits patients with end-stage renal failure and severe ischemic heart disease by relieving angina and improving their level of activity. It is unclear whether survival is improved for these patients."
CD008691,0,12451678,0,"[Discrepancies in the measurement of serum pancreatic lipase activities by non-enzymatic and enzymatic assays, and relationships to pseudohyperlipasemia].","I have observed discrepancies in the measurement of serum pancreatic lipase(LIP, Triacylglycerol acylhydrolase, EC 3.1.1.3) activities by non-enzymatic and enzymatic methods using diglyceride(1,2-dilinoleoyl-2-palmitoyl-glycerol, DLPG) as a substrate. The greatest discrepancies were seen in the post-heparin sera of patients with acute coronary syndrome(ACS). It is well-known that serum levels of lipoprotein lipase(LPL, EC 3.1.1.34) and hepatic triglyceride lipase(HTL, EC 3.1.1.3) show a significant increase after the administration of heparin in hemodialysis patients, and even larger quantities of heparin are administered before cardioangiography for ACS. Moreover, inhibitors of LPL and HTL induce almost complete reduction of increased LIP activity in post-heparin serum as measured by enzymatic assays. Pseudohyperlipasemia and positive interference from post-heparin serum LIP activity in enzymatic assays are considered to largely reflect LPL and HTL activities. Therefore, enzymatic reagent kits need improvement."

CD008691,0,12601961,0,[Pediatric renal transplantation from related living donor].,"Living related donor (LRD) provides significant advantages when compared with cadaveric donor (CAD) in term of improved patient and graft survival and shorten waiting time. From 1985, 176 kidney transplants were performed at our Center. Of these, 156 (89%) were from CAD and 20 (11%) were from LRD, first degree. The purpose of this paper is to show our experience at 5 years with use of LRD. All donors underwent standardized metabolic workup, angiography assessed and renal function test. Twelve children received their first transplant and 8 were retransplant (6-second, 1-third and 1-fourth). Immunosuppressive therapy consisted of globulin antithymocyte, azathioprine, cyclosporine and prednisolone, using FK506 and mycophenolate mofetil in some of them. Four kidneys with multiple renal arteries were reconstructed ex vivo with microsurgical technique before transplantation. The most significant morbidity was due to FK506-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) with graft lost. All patients (donor and recipient) survived. Five years graft survival rate is 95% and mean glomerular filtration rate is 81.33 ml/min/1.73 m2."

CD008691,0,16623672,0,Large variations in prescriptions of gastrointestinal medications in hemodialysis patients on three continents: the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS).,"Little is known about proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H(2) receptor antagonist (HA) prescription patterns or regarding use of predictors in hemodialysis patients. Proton pump inhibitor and HA prescribing patterns were investigated in 8628 hemodialysis patients from seven countries enrolled in the prospective, observational Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study. Logistic regression examined predictors associated with PPI and HA use, adjusting for age, sex, country, time with end-stage renal disease, medications, 14 comorbid conditions, and the association between the number of comorbid conditions and the prescription of gastrointestinal (GI) medications. In a cross-section from February 1, 2000, 3.4% to 36.9% of patients received an HA and 0.8% to 26.9% took a PPI, depending upon the country. From 1996 to 2001, the prescription of HAs declined while PPI use increased. Facility use of HAs and PPIs ranged from 0% to 94% of patients. H2 receptor antagonist or PPI use was significantly and independently associated with age, narcotic use, corticosteroids, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, coronary artery disease history, cardiovascular diseases other than hypertension or congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary disease, and GI bleed. Proton pump inhibitors or HAs were more likely to be prescribed in Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom than in the United States. The odds of PPI prescription increased if serum phosphorus <5.5 mEq/L or serum albumin <3.5 g/dL. Prescription of GI medications was associated with many comorbidities and use of several medications. Extreme variability of prescription patterns suggests that there is no standard approach in treatment practices."

However, diagnostic tools that can identify asymptomatic CAS have not yet been established.

However, in patients on hemodialysis, adverse cardiac events are frequently seen even if treated with drug-eluting stents.

CD008691,0,19833903,0,Effect of elective coronary angiography on glomerular filtration rate in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.,"Preemptive transplantation is ideal for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). The practice has been to perform coronary angiography (CA) on all patients aged >50, all diabetics, and all patients with cardiac symptoms or disease with a view to revascularization before transplantation. Historically patients have delayed CA until established on renal replacement therapy due to concerns of precipitating the need for chronic dialysis. The objectives of this study were to establish the risk of contrast nephropathy in patients with advanced CKD who undergo screening CA, and to determine whether or not preemptive transplantation is achievable."
CD008691,0,15492470,0,Assessment of coronary artery calcification in hemodialysis patients using multi-detector spiral CT scan.,"Cardiovascular disease in association with coronary artery calcification (CAC) is the leading cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The evaluation of CAC has been performed by electron beam CT scan. The purpose of the present study was to assess CAC using multi-detector spiral CT (MDCT) and to evaluate contributors to CAC in these patients. Fifty-three patients on chronic hemodialysis participated in this study. Their mean age was 61.0+/-9.6 years, and the mean duration of dialysis therapy was 6.7+/-5.4 years. We used an automatic device to measure arterial pulse wave velocity (PWV) as an index of arterial wall stiffness. The aortic calcification index (ACI) was quantified morphometrically by CT scan. The CAC score correlated positively with ACI score (r =0.863, p <0.0001). Linear regression analysis indicated that the CAC scores correlated positively with age (r =0.406, p =0.0023), C-reactive protein (r =0.38, p =0.0047) and PWV (r =0.303, p =0.0271). Stepwise regression analysis indicated that ACI (beta-coefficient=0.862, p <0.0001) and arterial PWV (beta-coefficient=0.303, p <0.0001) were independently associated with CAC score. The mean CAC score of patients with cardiac events (2,568.5+/-2,575.1 mm3) was significantly higher than that (258.0+/-409.2 mm3) of patients without cardiac events. In conclusion, our results showed clearly that assessment of CAC score using MDCT may be predictive for detecting the presence of coronary artery disease. CAC is indirectly associated with increased arterial stiffness and the extent of aortic calcification in hemodialysis patients. We did not find a significant correlation between CAC score and parameters of mineral metabolism, including serum levels of calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone. A longitudinal prospective study is required to assess the predictive value of this technique in determining cardiac events in large numbers of hemodialysis patients."
CD008691,0,3308409,0,"l-Carnitine. A preliminary review of its pharmacokinetics, and its therapeutic use in ischaemic cardiac disease and primary and secondary carnitine deficiencies in relationship to its role in fatty acid metabolism.","l-Carnitine occurs naturally as an essential cofactor of fatty acid metabolism which is synthesised endogenously or obtained from dietary sources. In patients with primary carnitine deficiencies, which may be life-threatening, and some secondary deficiencies such as organic acidurias, the exogenously administered compound is clearly beneficial: by abolishing hypotonia, motor skills are improved, as are muscle weakness and wasting. In preliminary clinical trials in patients with ischaemic cardiac disease, therapy with l-carnitine has shown beneficial effects on myocardial function and metabolism and has improved exercise tolerance in patients with angina pectoris-findings which require further substantiation in larger controlled studies. Moreover, while some interesting evidence suggests that l-carnitine may find potential use in such diverse conditions as carnitine deficiencies secondary to prolonged total parenteral nutrition supplementation or chronic haemodialysis, hyperlipidaemias and the prevention of toxicity induced by anthracyclines and valproate, such findings must be regarded as preliminary. Exogenously administered l-carnitine is very well tolerated. Thus, while its role in primary deficiencies is established, with its profile of negligible toxicity l-carnitine is worthy of further investigation to more clearly define its therapeutic applications in a variety of conditions which may be indirectly related to alterations in fatty acid metabolism."

A retrospective analysis was conducted to compare the epidemiology and outcomes between community-associated (CA) and healthcare-associated (HA) USA300 MRSA infections. The study enrolled 160 subjects with USA300 MRSA infections (47.5% CA-MRSA and 52.5% HA-MRSA). Failure in the HA group was higher (38.1%) compared with the CA group (23.7%) (P=0.05). Predictors of failure included male gender, age, presence of any co-morbidity, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, history of MRSA, previous admission, fluoroquinolone exposure, HA infection and osteomyelitis (P<or=0.05). Independent predictors of failure were osteomyelitis, history of MRSA, male gender and pneumonia. Recurrent disease was found in 32.6% of cases. Overall, USA300 MRSA most commonly causes infection of the skin and skin structure, however, 20% of subjects can experience more invasive disease with infection of the bloodstream, lung or bone. Failure rates are higher in subjects with healthcare risk factors or if the infection was acquired in the hospital, with these subjects experiencing more invasive infections such as bacteraemia, pneumonia or osteomyelitis."

Single-vessel disease was present in 71 (9%) patients, double-vessel disease in 204 (25%), and triple-vessel disease in 528 (66%). An ejection fraction < 30% was found in 127 (16%) cases. Angiography was carried out before discharge in 204 (25%) patients. Grafts included left and right internal mammary arteries and the radial artery. There were 2,661 grafts placed with a mean of 3.31 grafts per patient (range, 1 to 6). Operative mortality was 0.5%. There was no postoperative stroke and few incidences of renal impairment, even in patients with chronic renal failure. Blood transfusion was not required in 558 (69%) patients. Mean hospital stay was 5.6 days. Overall angiographic patency was 98.6%. Total arterial revascularization on the beating heart was found to be safe, effective, and reproducible in almost all patients, with excellent short-term patency rates and minimal morbidity."
CD008691,0,9361933,0,Assessment of long-term risks for living related kidney donors by 24-h blood pressure monitoring and testing for microalbuminuria.,"Our aim was to assess the long-term risks for kidney donors of developing arterial hypertension and hypertension-associated diseases or hyperfiltration injury of the remaining solitary kidney. We conducted a cross-sectional study in which 29 donors who were nephrectomized at our center between October 1973 and March 1990 were enrolled. At the time of evaluation median age was 54 (37-70) yr. Since kidney donation an average time interval of 11.1 +/- 3.8 yr had elapsed. Body weight, casual blood pressure, S-creatinine and proteinuria were recorded. In 28/29 donors 24-h blood pressure monitoring was performed; all 29 were tested for microalbuminuria (MAU). The patient history was checked for treatment with antihypertensives, coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus. From all 29 kidney donors surveyed up to 19.8 yr none developed marked renal insufficiency: median S-creatinine was 1.0 mg/dl (range 0.7-1.6), only 3 donors had a S-creatinine > 1.3 mg/dl. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased in an age-dependent manner. While all donors had been normotensive without an antihypertensive treatment at time of nephrectomy, actually 29% proved to be hypertensive with average values > 130/80 mmHg in the 24-h assessment. 5/29 donors received antihypertensives, 3 of whom nevertheless were hypertensive. Day-night profile was lost in 2 patients. After donation one patient developed coronary heart disease. 7/29 donors (24%) displayed positive testing for MAU, furthermore one had proteinuria (approx. 300 mg/l). MAU was associated in one case with slightly elevated S-creatinine (1.3 mg/dl) and in 3 cases with arterial hypertension. In the long-term course living related kidney donors do not seem to be at risk for developing hypertensive disorders more often than the general population. The prevalence of MAU in the 29 cases studied was higher than so far described for healthy subjects. This may reflect subclinical hyperfiltration damage of the glomerulus. Progressive renal insufficiency with clinical relevant function loss of the remaining solitary organ, however, was not observed up to 19.8 yr after kidney donation."
CD008691,0,19765448,0,Effect of renal transplantation on coronary artery calcification in hemodialysis patients.,"Vascular calcification is a strong predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Coronary artery calcification is more frequent, more extensive, and progresses more rapidly among subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) than in the general population. It is also considered to be a marker of coronary heart disease, the main cause of increased morbidity and mortality among patients either on maintenance hemodialysis or after transplantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of renal transplantation on the calcium scores of coronary arteries among hemodialysis patients."
CD008691,0,19190822,0,Uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (ucMGP) is associated with coronary artery calcification in haemodialysis patients.,"Matrix gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) protein (MGP) is a potent local inhibitor of cardiovascular calcification and accumulates at areas of calcification in its uncarboxylated form (ucMGP). We previously found significantly lower circulating ucMGP levels in patients with a high vascular calcification burden. Here we report on the potential of circulating ucMGP to serve as a biomarker for vascular calcification in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Circulating ucMGP levels were measured with an ELISA-based assay in 40 HD patients who underwent multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) scanning to quantify the extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC). The mean ucMGP level in HD patients (193 +/- 65 nM) was significantly lower as compared to apparently healthy subjects of the same age (441 +/- 97 nM; p < 0.001) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) without CAC (560 +/- 140 nM; p < 0.001). Additionally, ucMGP levels correlated inversely with CAC scores (r = -0.41; p = 0.009), and this correlation persisted after adjustment for age, dialysis vintage and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Since circulating ucMGP levels are significantly and inversely correlated with the extent of CAC in HD patients, ucMGP may become a tool for identifying HD patients with a high probability of cardiovascular calcification."
CD008691,0,9216132,0,Closed-loop drug infusion for control of heart-rate trajectory in pharmacological stress tests.,"The diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) is an important task in the management of cardiology patients. Recently, the use of pharmacological stress testing has become available as an alternative to exercise stress testing (ETT). A new system (device-drug combination) was developed specifically for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The system uses a novel catecholamine, arbutamine, which is infused intravenously to increase heart rate (HR) and cardiac contractility in order to evoke signs of ischemia. The development of a closed-loop control algorithm for the delivery of this drug and a pharmacodynamic (PD) model representing the HR response to arbutamine infusions are presented. Model parameters are estimated from clinical data on normal volunteers and patients. Based on this mathematical model, a rule-based control algorithm is designed. The structure of the control algorithm is discussed and testing of the algorithm based on simulations and animal and human trials are summarized. Results from clinical trials shows that the algorithm controls the HR increase according to a selected trajectory. The automated delivery of the drug can provide the cardiologist with an efficient, effective, and safe method for administering a pharmacological stress test."
CD008691,0,20224838,0,The simplified modification of diet in renal disease equation as a predictor of renal function after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.,"After open-heart surgery, a percentage of patients have impaired renal function. This deterioration is even seen in patients with serum creatinine (s-creatinine) values that fall within the normal laboratory range, therefore s-creatinine is not an accurate reflection of renal function. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a better indication of renal status. GFR can be calculated with the simplified modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation - a formula that takes age, gender, race and s-creatinine level into account. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between estimated GFR pre-operatively and renal impairment postoperatively."
CD008691,0,11146683,0,Clinical outcomes of PTCA in chronic renal failure: a case-control study for comorbid features and evaluation of dialysis dependence.,"We compared clinical outcomes following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for 77 chronic renal failure (CRF) (dialysis and nondialysis) patients and a control group matched for history of myocardial revascularization, specific revascularization procedure, gender, age, diabetes, number of native vessels diseased, number of vessels dilated, and the specific vessel(s) dilated. CRF patients had a higher incidence of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and more complex PTCA target lesion types than controls: 5% vs. 16% Type A, 12% vs. 28% Type B1, 44% vs. 41% Type B2, 39% vs. 15% Type C (p < 0.001). The primary success rate for PTCA in CRF patients and controls was 89% and 97% (p < 0.05). Survival analysis 24 months following PTCA showed a lower composite cardiac event-free survival (angiographic restenosis, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery, and cardiac death) for those with CRF than controls, 54% vs. 69% (p = 0.002). Over the study period, 26 CRF patients died (11 from cardiac causes) compared to only 3 control patients (one from a cardiac cause); p < 0.001 for all cause and p < 0.003 for cardiac mortality. We also compared PTCA results between two categories of CRF patients. The first consisted of 49 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on dialysis and the second included 28 patients not on dialysis (13 with creatinine > 2. 0 mg/dL and 15 with ESRD post-renal transplant). Both subgroups had similar coronary anatomy, including PTCA, target lesion type, and acute and long-term outcomes. In conclusion, we observed acceptable primary success and complication rates for PTCA in CRF patients compared with controls matched for comorbid features despite more complex target lesion morphology. Poorer long-term outcomes, however, were apparent for those with CRF regardless of dialysis dependence and likely relate to more extensive atherosclerosis and complex target coronary lesions at index PTCA as well as other features related to CRF."
CD008691,0,6372457,0,Postinfectious glomerulonephritis in a renal allograft associated with a mycotic aneurysm of a coronary artery.,"Postinfectious glomerulonephritis is well known to occur after various infections but is rare in renal allografts, perhaps as a result of immunosuppressive therapy. This report describes a 47-year-old man who, seven years after receiving a cadaveric renal transplant, had biopsy-proved crescentic glomerulonephritis presenting with gross hematuria and rapidly progressive renal failure. The patient underwent cardiac surgery to define an abnormal structure shown on echocardiography, and a mycotic aneurysm of the left circumflex artery was discovered. Such aneurysms are uncommon and rarely diagnosed during life. This case appears to be the first report of glomerulonephritis associated with a mycotic aneurysm of a coronary artery and one of the few reports of postinfectious glomerulonephritis in a renal allograft."
CD008691,0,18638601,0,Incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with chronic renal insufficiency undergoing multidetector computed tomographic angiography treated with preventive measures.,"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is associated with adverse outcomes. Strategies for its prevention have been evaluated for patients undergoing invasive coronary and peripheral angiography, including treatment with N-acetylcysteine, sodium bicarbonate, and use of iso-osmolar nonionic contrast. Recently, multidetector computed tomographic angiography (MDCTA) of the coronary and peripheral arteries has been introduced as an accurate method for assessing vascular stenosis and has been widely adopted for assessment of outpatients with suspected coronary artery disease or peripheral arterial disease. To date, the incidence of CIN in outpatients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) treated with CIN-preventive strategies undergoing MDCTA remains unknown. Thus, we evaluated the incidence of CIN in outpatients with CRI (creatinine 1.5 to 2.5 mg/dl) undergoing MDCTA using CIN-preventive measures; 400 patients with CRI (78.5% men, mean age 76 years, 41% with diabetes) underwent MDCTA with iodixanol for detection of coronary artery disease or peripheral arterial disease (mean contrast volume 101 cc). CIN was defined as a nonallergic creatinine increase of >0.5 mg/dl. Creatinine levels were obtained before and 3 to 5 days after MDCTA; the average creatinine levels were 1.80 mg/dl and 1.75 mg/dl, respectively (p = NS), with an average change of -0.03 mg/dl. In the study cohort, only 7 patients (1.75%) experienced a creatinine increase >0.5 mg/dl, satisfying the definition of CIN. In conclusion, multivariate analysis, diabetes was the only predictor for CIN (odds ratio 5.9, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 33.3, p = 0.045). No patient required hemodialysis. In conclusion, in patients with CRI undergoing MDCTA and receiving CIN-preventive measures, the incidence of CIN is low."
CD008691,0,20237457,0,Coronary artery calcification and mortality in diabetic patients with proteinuria.,"Vascular calcification is one of the mechanisms mediating the higher mortality risk associated with the hyperphosphatemia of chronic kidney disease. Though common, and often severe in non-dialyzed proteinuric diabetics, there are no studies on the prognostic significance of coronary artery calcification in early stage type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Here we determine this significance in 225 proteinuric diabetic patients (mean age 57 years, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 52 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a median urine protein-creatinine ratio of 2.7). Coronary artery calcification, measured by electron beam computed tomography, was diagnosed in 86% of the patients, the severity of which correlated with older age, male gender, and white ethnicity. However, no association was found between eGFR, serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, or 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Over an average follow-up of 39 months, 54 patients died. A graded relationship between the severity of calcification and all-cause mortality was consistently demonstrated on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients in the highest quartile of calcification score had a 2.5-fold higher risk for death. Our results show the severity of coronary artery calcification early in the course of chronic kidney disease is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Additional studies need to determine whether altering the natural history of coronary artery calcification in early chronic kidney disease prolongs survival."

Dipyridamole thallium-201 (Tl-201) perfusion imaging revealed myocardial perfusion defects in 8 patients (61%) from group A, 4 (50%) from group B and 1 (12.5%) from group C. These defects were localized in the inferior, posterior and septal segments of the left ventricle. Abnormal myocardial perfusion was associated with age over 50 years and aortic calcifications (p less than 0.05). Eight patients died within the following four years. All had aortic calcifications (p less than 0.001). Our results show that myocardial perfusion defects are frequent even in non-symptomatic HD patients. This suggests that ischemic heart disease could be more frequent than estimated by clinical symptoms alone. Tl-201 scintigraphy may be a useful non-invasive procedure in cardiological evaluation of HD patients."

CD008691,0,7750623,0,[A case report of aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma complicated with chronic renal failure associated with nephrocalcinosis: review of APAs complicated with chronic renal failure].,"A 57-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of dyspnea due to congestive heart failure caused by hypertensive heart disease in September, 1992. Twenty years ago, he was diagnosed to be hypertensive, and in 1980, he was diagnosed to at our hospital to have primary aldosteronism (PA) due to a right aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma (APA). There were no hypertensive vascular complications at that time. He refused surgical removal, and anti-hypertensive drugs including spironolactone were administered. However, his drug compliance was very inaccurate. On this recent admission, left ventricular hypertrophy associated with impaired contractivity, hypertensive retinal change and mild protein uria were noted, but no hematuria was detected. His renal function was impaired (Ccr: 15.2ml/min). An abdominal CT scan showed a typical right APA, bilateral renal atrophy and fine granular calcification at renal medulla, even though he had no hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. In addition, multiple cerebral infarction was demonstrated by a brain CT scan, along with coronary artery stenoses at the right coronary artery and left circumflex branch by coronary angiography and bilateral multiple renal artery stenoses by renal angiography. Right adrenalectomy and renal biopsy were performed. Histological examinations revealed a yellow tan-colored APA, many sclerotic glomerulus, and severely hyarinized renal arterioles. After adrenalectomy, blood pressure was not normalized but was controlled easily by hypotensive agents. Impaired renal function was not improved and deteriorated slightly but did not get worse there after. Since 1959, including ours, 22 cases of APAs complicated with chronic renal failure were reported in Japan. In conclusion, surgical removal should be recommended for APA, even if the patient's condition is complicated with chronic renal failure."
CD008691,0,17826390,0,Predictors of survival in patients with end-stage renal disease evaluated for kidney transplantation.,"Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This study examined the all-cause mortality in 3,698 patients with ESRD evaluated for kidney transplantation at our institution from 2001 to 2004. Mean age for the cohort was 48+/-12 years, and 42% were women. Stress myocardial perfusion imaging was done in 2,207 patients (60%) and coronary angiography in 260 patients (7%). There were 622 deaths (17%) during a mean follow-up period of 30+/-15 months. The presence and severity of coronary disease on angiography was not predictive of survival. Coronary revascularization did not impact survival (p=0.6) except in patients with 3-vessel disease (p=0.05). The best predictor of death was left ventricular ejection fraction, measured by gated myocardial perfusion imaging, with 2.7% mortality increase for each 1% ejection fraction decrease. In conclusion, left ventricular ejection fraction is a strong predictor of survival in patients with ESRD awaiting renal transplantation.

Ischemic heart disease is responsible for many cardiovascular deaths, with myocardial infarction accounting for approximately 15% and sudden cardiac death or severe left ventricular dysfunction accounting for much of the remainder. The markedly increased prevalence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients with ESRD is influenced, at least in part, by numerous risk factors for atherosclerosis, with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia being particularly important. Because atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD), whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, is associated with an increased incidence of allograft failure and mortality, the results of this study suggest the need for careful evaluation for the presence of CAD in those persons who are under consideration for renal transplantation. Candidates with angina pectoris, previous myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure are at particularly high risk of a cardiac event, and, therefore, should routinely undergo pretransplant coronary angiography and subsequent surgical revascularization if angina is refractory to medical therapy or CAD is extensive. In contrast, although young, nondiabetic transplant candidates without symptoms or electrocardiographic evidence of CAD have an increased relative risk of cardiac death when compared with age-matched control subjects, their absolute risk of such an event is very low. As a result, they do not require a cardiac evaluation before transplantation. For the remaining transplant candidates at neither low nor high risk of a fatal or nonfatal cardiac event (i.e., those at intermediate risk), the authors of this study routinely perform (1) thallium imaging with dipyridamole or (2) two-dimensional echocardiography with intravenous dobutamine. If the result of these investigations are normal, transplantation proceeds; if abnormal, coronary angiography is performed, followed by surgical revascularization if CAD is extensive. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is not recommended in patients with ESRD because it appears to be accompanied by a high likelihood of acute and chronic complications. Although it is hoped that surgical revascularization before renal transplantation improves allograft and patient survival, prospectively obtained data proving that this, in fact, is true do not exist."

CD008691,0,17699259,0,Coronary artery and other vascular calcifications in patients with cystinosis after kidney transplantation.,"Cystinosis, an autosomal recessive disorder of lysosomal cystine accumulation, results from mutations in the CTNS gene that encodes the lysosomal cystine transporter, cystinosin. Renal tubular Fanconi syndrome occurs in infancy, followed by rickets, growth retardation, photophobia, and renal failure, which requires renal transplantation at approximately 10 yr of age. Treatment with cysteamine decreases cellular cystine levels, retards renal deterioration, and allows for normal growth. Patients with a history of inadequate cystine depletion therapy may survive, after renal transplantation, into the third to fifth decades but will experience other, extrarenal complications of the disease. Routine chest and head computed tomography scans of 41 posttransplantation patients with cystinosis were reviewed for vascular calcification. The radiologic procedures had been performed to examine lung and brain parenchyma, so there was little ascertainment bias. Thirteen of the 41 patients had vascular calcification, including 11 with coronary artery calcification. One 25-yr-old man required three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery. There were no significant differences between the 13 patients with calcification and the 28 without calcification in the following parameters: Time on dialysis, frequency of transplantation, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, homozygosity for the 57-kb deletion in CTNS, serum creatinine, and calcium-phosphate product. However, the finding of vascular calcification correlated directly with duration of life without cysteamine therapy and inversely with duration of life under good cystine-depleting therapy. The accumulation of intracellular cystine itself maybe a risk factor for vascular calcifications, and older patients with cystinosis should be screened for this complication."

There were 30 implant patients (18 men, 12 women), with ages ranging from 32 to 83 years. Diagnoses included calcified aortic stenosis (n = 16), pure aortic insufficiency (n = 9), and mixed aortic stenosis and insufficiency (n = 5). Associated diagnoses have included chronic renal failure treated with dialysis (n = 1), coronary artery disease requiring concomitant coronary bypass (n = 1), ascending aortic aneurysm requiring resection (n = 3), and mitral insufficiency requiring concomitant mitral valvuloplasty (n = 2). All of the valve replacements were in the aortic position. These implanted patients are being followed up carefully according to the protocol that requires examination every 6 months for the first year and every 12 months subsequently. No patient has been lost to follow-up. Twenty-seven patients are alive and well from 1 to 22 months postoperatively. There were three deaths: two perioperative deaths (one perivalvular leak and one hemorrhage) and one infective endocarditis 1.3 years after valve replacement. All surviving patients were followed up by echocardiographic examination (mean gradient, 15.5 +/- 6.8 mm Hg at 1 year). In conclusion, the feasibility of this method and concept has been demonstrated with implants in 30 patients. The validity of the technique will be judged by clinical results and experiences in children."
CD008691,0,20200622,0,Revascularization options in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients who have chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease and are undergoing hemodialysis. Chronic kidney disease is a recognized risk factor for premature atherosclerosis. Unfortunately, most major randomized clinical trials that form the basis for evidence-based use of revascularization procedures exclude patients who have renal insufficiency. Retrospective, observational studies suggest that patients with end-stage renal disease and severe coronary occlusive disease have a lower risk of death if they undergo coronary revascularization rather than medical therapy alone. Due to a lack of prospective studies, however, the relative merits of percutaneous versus surgical revascularization are merely a matter of opinion. Several small, retrospective studies have shown that coronary artery bypass grafting is associated with higher procedural death but better long-term survival than is percutaneous coronary intervention. This difference appears to result from poor long-term results of percutaneous coronary intervention in patients who have chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.Because randomized trials comparing percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting have included patients undergoing balloon angioplasty and placement of bare-metal stents, their conclusions are suspect in the era of drug-eluting stents. In this review, we discuss different revascularization options for patients with chronic kidney disease, the outcomes of revascularization procedures, and the risk factors for adverse outcomes."

CD008691,0,8861439,0,Coronary artery bypass grafting without cardiopulmonary bypass for high-risk patients.,"Between January 1991 and June 1993, coronary artery bypass grafting was performed without either cardiopulmonary bypass or cardiac arrest in 23 patients. Most patients had several surgical risk factors, including age > or = 70 years, poor left ventricular function, left main coronary artery stenosis, chronic renal failure, and aortic aneurysm. Distal anastomoses were made under temporary interruption of coronary flow. A total of 37 distal anastomoses to the left anterior descending coronary artery and/or right coronary artery (mean 1.6 per patient) were made, 24 of which were internal thoracic arteries. The coronary occlusion time ranged from 7-14 min (mean 9.8 min). Combined cardiac or vascular operations were carried out in six patients (abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, thoracic aortic aneurysm repair, carotid endarterectomy, and coronary endarterectomy). There was one hospital death. Postoperative angiography was performed in 22 patients and showed a patency rate of 89%. In summary, coronary artery bypass grafting without cardiopulmonary bypass may improve the postoperative outcome of high-risk patients."

CD008691,0,19128934,0,Impact of chronic kidney disease on outcomes of superficial femoral artery endoluminal interventions.,"While aggressive endoluminal therapy for superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease is commonplace, the implications of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on long-term outcomes in this population are unclear. We examined the consequences of endovascular treatment of the SFA in patients with and without varying stages of CKD. A database of patients undergoing endovascular treatment of the SFA between 1986 and 2007 was queried, and two groups were defined: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <or=60 and >60 mL/min/1.73 cm(2). Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results were standardized to TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC-II) and Society for Vascular Surgery criteria. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Factor analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazard model for time-dependent variables. Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation where appropriate. There were 525 limbs in 535 patients (68% male, average age 66 +/- 14 years) that underwent endovascular treatment for claudication or chronic critical limb ischemia (51%). Patients with eGFR <or=60 were older and had significantly more coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. TASC-II lesion distribution was equivalent (37% for TASC-II C and D), but tibial runoff was significantly worse in the eGFR <or=60 group. In addition, there were more inflow and outflow interventions in the eGFR <or=60 group. In patients with claudication, there was no difference in patency or limb salvage between those with eGFR <or=60 and >60. In patients with critical limb ischemia, there was no difference in patency between those with eGFR <or=60 and >60. Limb salvage was worse in patients with eGFR <or=60 compared to eGFR >60. With respect to limb salvage, six factors were significantly associated with a reduction in rates: presence of tissue loss at presentation (relative risk [RR] = 6.45, p = 0.003), 0 or 1 vessel tibial runoff (RR = 2.56, p < 0.01), progression of distal disease noted in follow-up (RR = 4.62, p < 0.01), embolization at the initial intervention (RR = 2.70, p < 0.05), diabetes mellitus (RR = 3.71, p < 0.01), and a history of congestive heart disease (RR = 2.42, p < 0.01). Notable factors that were not significantly associated included lesion calcification (p = 0.64), TASC C or D lesion categorization (p = 0.99), acute occlusion at initial intervention (p = 0.40), and adjuvant stenting (p = 0.67). CKD does not impact the patency of SFA interventions. Limb salvage in patients with critical ischemia is significantly worse when the eGFR is <or=60 mL/min/1.73 cm(2)."

CD008691,0,16298262,0,Erythropoietin in heart failure.,"The incidence of both congestive heart failure (CHF) and end-stage renal disease both are increasing. Anemia is common in both conditions and is associated with a marked increase in mortality and morbidity in both CHF and chronic kidney insufficiency (CKI). Each of these 3 conditions can cause or worsen the other 2. In other words, a vicious circle frequently is present in which CHF can cause or worsen both anemia and CKI, in which CKI can cause or worsen both anemia and CHF, and in which anemia can cause or worsen both CHF and CKI. We have called this vicious circle the cardio renal anemia syndrome. Optimal treatment of CHF with all the recommended CHF medications at their recommended doses will, in our experience, frequently fail to improve the CHF and CKI if anemia is present and is not corrected. On the other hand, correction of the anemia with subcutaneous erythropoietin and intravenous iron has caused a great improvement in the CHF including a marked improvement in patient and cardiac function and a marked reduction in the need for hospitalization and for high-dose diuretics. It also frequently has caused renal function to improve or at least stabilize. In addition, patients' quality of life and exercise capacity also have improved with the correction of the anemia. In CKI patients, anemia also may play an important role in increasing the risk for death, coronary heart disease, stroke, and progression to end-stage renal disease. Erythropoietin may have a direct positive effect on the heart and brain unrelated to correction of the anemia by reducing cell apoptosis and by increasing neovascularization, both of which could prevent tissue damage. This could have profound therapeutic implications not only in CHF but in the future treatment of myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, strokes, and renal failure."

CD008691,0,8039226,0,High incidence of renal artery stenosis in patients with coronary artery disease.,"The incidence of renal artery stenosis (RAS) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been well documented.

There were 68 females and 128 males with a mean age of 63 years (range 35-85). Angiographically significant CAD was present in 152 patients (78%). Of the total patient cohort, 29 patients (15%) had mild RAS (< 50%), and 36 patients (18%) had significant RAS (> or = 50%). In patients with normal coronary arteries, only three patients (7%) had RAS. Thirty-three patients (92%) with severe RAS also had CAD. Of these 33 patients, 45% had hypertension, 30% had hyperlipidemia, 24% had diabetes mellitus, 24% had renal insufficiency (creatinine > or = 1.5), and 51% were smokers. In addition, it was noted that 20 of these patients (61%) had two or more of the above-listed clinical parameters. However, univariate analysis using the chi-square test revealed that only CAD (22% P < 0.03) and renal insufficiency (29% P < 0.15) were reliable clinical predictors of RAS. In conclusion, RAS is a frequent finding in patients with CAD, particularly when renal insufficiency is also present."

CD008691,0,12547989,0,Noninvasive coronary artery imaging by multislice spiral computed tomography.,"Although the excellent spatial resolution of multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) enables the coronary arteries to be visualized, its limited temporal resolution results in poor image reproducibility because of cardiac motion artifact (CMA) and hence limits its widespread clinical use. A novel retrospectively ECG-gated reconstruction method has been developed to minimize CMA. In 88 consecutive patients, the scan data were reconstructed using 2 retrospectively ECG-gated reconstruction methods. Method 1: the end of the reconstruction window (250 ms) was positioned at the peak of the P wave on ECG, which corresponded to the end of the slow filling phase during diastole immediately before atrial contraction. Method 2 (conventional method): relative retrospective gating with 50% referred to the R-R interval was performed so that the beginning of the reconstruction window (250 ms) was positioned at the halfway point between the R-R intervals of the heart cycle. The quality of the coronary artery images was evaluated according to the presence or absence of CMA. The assessment was applied to the left main coronary artery (LMCA), the left anterior descending artery (LAD, segments #6, #7 and #8), the left circumflex artery (LCx, segments #11 and #13) and the right coronary artery (RCA, segments #1, #2 and #3). The first diagonal artery (#9-1), the obtuse marginal artery (#12-1), the posterior descending artery (#4-PD), the atrioventricular node branch (#4-AV) and the first right ventricular branch (RV) were also evaluated. Of the 88 patients, 85 were eligible for image evaluation. Method 1 allowed visualization of the major coronary arteries without CMA in the majority of patients. The LCA system (segments #5-7, #11 and #13) and the proximal portion of the RCA were visualized in more than 94% of patients. Artifact-free visualization of the distal portion of the LAD (segment #8) and RCA (#4PD and #4AV), and side branches (#9-1, #12-1 and RV) was also achieved in more than 80% of patients. On the other hand, CMA occurred frequently on images obtained by Method 2. The LCx and RCA systems were the most affected by CMA, revealing only 41% artifact-free visualization of the segment #13, 39% of #1, 15% of #2 and 32% of #3. Thus, Method 1, which avoids the ventricular motion occurring during the rapid filling and atrial contraction phases, gives superior image quality over the conventional ECG-gated reconstruction method."
CD008691,0,18381881,0,Current status of off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.,"The expanding indications for angioplasty coupled with the successful short and mid-term results of randomized controlled trials of drug-eluting stents have already had an unquestionable impact on the practice of coronary revascularization operations. However, coronary artery bypass grafting remains a major mode of therapy for coronary artery disease. It is likely that surgery will continue to be preferred for more complex subsets and that surgeons will have to continue to maintain good results in patients with more complex problems. Concerns regarding morbidity associated with conventional surgical myocardial revascularization on cardiopulmonary bypass have led to a resurgence of interest in off-pump bypass surgery during the last decade, with the expectation that it would be safer if cardiopulmonary bypass could be avoided. This review summarizes the impact of off-pump bypass surgery in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with conventional coronary artery bypass on cardiopulmonary bypass by evaluating the current best-available evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses comparing off-pump surgery with conventional bypass grafting."

Though symptomatic ischemic heart disease (IHD) was present in 33% of HD patients and in 17% of TRs, 50% and 39%, respectively, had Tl-201 findings indicative of IHD. The duration of HD treatment was similar for patients with an abnormal or normal scintigraphic finding. Abnormal Tl-201 results were seen more frequently in older patients. During follow-up, 27 of 36 HD-patients died, 16 had an abnormal and 11 a normal Tl-201-DPM finding; cardiovascular complications were the cause of death in 88% and 18% of these patients, respectively. Thus the incidence of death from fatal cardiac events was 12% per year at risk for the former and 1.9% per year at risk for the latter. In TRs survival was not different for patients with an abnormal or normal Tl-201 finding (56% vs. 64%). However, fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events were seen more frequently in patients with an abnormal Tl-201 results (78% versus 7%; p less than 0.0001). Stepwise logistic analysis and survival analysis demonstrated Tl-201-DPM stress/redistribution scintigraphy to be the only predictor for identifying patients at increased risk for cardiovascular events.

However, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the important risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), and the interpretation of normal stress MPI has not been well established in CKD patients with no evidence of CAD. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term prognostic value of stress MPI in CKD patients with no evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction."
CD008691,0,15462104,1,Pretransplant cardiac investigations in the Irish renal transplant population--the effectiveness of our current screening techniques in predicting cardiac events.,Coronary artery disease (CAD) is prevalent among endstage renal failure patients and remains the major cause of mortality following renal transplantation. Death with a functioning transplant institute remains the most common cause of kidney graft failure. In this study we attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of the clinical history and current screening techniques available in predicting posttransplant CAD and also assess the role of coronary angiography as a pretransplant screening technique.
CD008691,0,9113492,0,Post-transplant diabetes mellitus. The role of immunosuppression.,"Immunosuppressive agents increase the risk of death due to coronary disease or stroke by their ability to cause 3 different adverse effects: dyslipidaemia, hypertension and hyperglycaemia. Post-transplant diabetes mellitus has emerged as a major adverse effect of immunosuppressants. As recipients of organ transplants survive longer, the secondary complications of diabetes mellitus have assumed greater importance. There is a need for a precise definition of post-transplant diabetes mellitus to facilitate inter-centre comparison and to study the natural history of post-transplant diabetes mellitus. We recommend broad criteria to define hyperglycaemia, as a fasting blood glucose level of > 400 mg/dl at any point or > 200 mg/dl for 2 weeks, or a need for insulin treatment for at least 2 weeks. We also recommend serial measurements of HbA1c. Cyclosporin and tacrolimus cause post-transplant diabetes mellitus by a number of mechanisms, including decreased insulin secretion, increased insulin resistance or a direct toxic effect on the beta cell. For corticosteroids, the induction of insulin resistance seems to be the predominant factor. However, few studies have examined the mechanism of diabetogenicity at the molecular level. This may hold the key for pharmacological manipulation of current immunosuppressive regimens which may result in decreased metabolic complications. Corticosteroid sparing regimens have been shown to reduce the metabolic complications of immunosuppressants including post-transplant diabetes mellitus. However, their use should be balanced against the increased incidence of transplant rejections. Post-transplant diabetes mellitus may be organ-specific irrespective of the immunosuppressant used. Tacrolimus causes a high incidence of post-transplant diabetes mellitus in recipients of kidney transplants (upto 20% in some reports); the diabetogenicity of cyclosporin-based regimens is comparable with that of tacrolimus-based regimens in recipients of liver transplants. A few clinical studies in which attempts were made to discontinue cyclosporin resulted in an unacceptable loss of the transplant. In the case of tacrolimus, complete withdrawal of immunosuppression may be possible in selected patients with liver transplants. However, post-transplant recipients who may benefit from this approach are difficult to identify. In some early series, patients received doses of tacrolimus that were approximately 2 to 3 times higher than those currently used, which may have resulted in a higher incidence of post-transplant diabetes mellitus. More recently, it has been shown that tacrolimus was successful in salvaging whole pancreatic grafts which were maintained on cyclosporin. Tacrolimus-based immunosuppression as primary therapy was also used with remarkable success in solitary whole pancreas transplants. Strategies to reduce the metabolic complications of immunosuppressants should be pursued aggressively as this will directly lead to a decrease in long term cardiovascular adverse effects."

CD008691,0,15736585,0,Cardiac troponins in renal insufficiency and other non-ischemic cardiac conditions.,"The emergence of cardiac troponins has been an interesting step in the diagnosis of ACS. It has clearly helped us to better triage patients toward a more aggressive posture in performing early cardiac catheterization, and in some cases, early use of adjunctive Gp IIb/IIIa antagonists and percutaneous or surgical myocardial revascularization. However, with this step forward has come uncertainty and many cardiology consults regarding positive cardiac troponins in patients without ACS or myocardial infarction. In general, increased cardiac troponins imply a worse prognosis. This is clearly true of patients with ESRD and advanced heart failure. It is also true of patients with severe, noncardiac illnesses. In other situations, such as acute pericarditis and cardiac surgery, slightly elevated cardiac troponins do not seem to predict a worse prognosis, and can probably be disregarded. The elevation of cardiac troponins after successful percutaneous coronary interventions is not unexpected, and the level of cardiac troponin release seems to predict problems, but lively controversy persists. Last, monitoring cardiac troponins in cardiac transplant recipients and those receiving certain cardiotoxic chemotherapies may be of some diagnostic value, but clearly more experience and clinical research are needed."
CD008691,0,10870011,0,Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting using the saphenous vein in redo CABG.,"We describe a patient who underwent minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB), who had previously undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) through a median sternotomy with a left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and a right gastroepiploic artery (GEA) graft to the posterior descending artery. MIDCAB was less invasive and was an effective alternative procedure for the second operation. Because the patient had no LIMA or GEA available for a graft because of prior use, we used a saphenous vein graft (SVG) for bypassing from the left subclavian artery to the coronary artery by MIDCAB via a left minithoracotomy. The left subclavian artery was selected as the proximal anastomotic site because this artery was less diseased and was easier to reach. The SVG-to-coronary artery anastomosis was facilitated by firm adhesion between the epicardium and the pericardium, which reduced the motion of the epicardium itself. These results suggest that the procedure is safe and promising in selected cases of redo CABG."
CD008691,0,18818684,0,Location of acute coronary artery thromboses in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease have high rates of myocardial infarction and death following an initial attack. Proximal location of coronary atherosclerotic lesions has been linked to the risk of acute myocardial infarction and to infarction-associated mortality. To examine if the spatial distribution of lesions differs in patients with and without chronic kidney disease, we used quantitative coronary angiography to measure this in patients with acute coronary thromboses who were having angiography following acute myocardial infarction. Multivariable linear regression was used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics. Among 82 patients with stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease, 55.6% of lesions were located within 30 mm and 87.7% were within 50 mm of the coronary ostia. This compared to 34.7 and 71.8%, respectively, among 299 patients without significant kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease was independently and significantly associated with a 7.0 mm decrease in the distance from the coronary ostia to the problem lesion. Our study suggests that a causal link between a more proximal culprit lesion location in patients with chronic kidney disease and their high mortality rates after myocardial infarct is possible and may have important implications for interventions to prevent infarction."

CD008691,0,11052267,1,Noninvasive assessment of cardiac risk in type I diabetic patients being evaluated for combined pancreas-kidney transplantation using dipyridamole-MIBI perfusion tomographic scintigraphy.,"This study was performed to determine the value of dipyridamole-99m Tc-methoxy-isobutyl isonitrile perfusion (99mTC-MIBI) tomographic scintigraphy in the assessment of cardiac risk in patients being evaluated prior to combined pancreas-kidney transplantation (PKT). We performed perfusion tomographic scintigraphy using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) on 77 patients. The tomographic images did not show clinically relevant findings in 65 patients. In the remaining 12 patients, coronary arteriography was performed: 2 showed normal results, 4 showed no stenosis, and 6 showed significant stenosis ( > or = 70%). Seventy-two patients underwent PKT. During the follow-up (6-48 months), there were seven cardiac events, 4 patients with significant stenosis, and 3 with nonsignificant stenosis upon coronary arteriography, and all had pathological tomographic images. 99mTc-MIBI tomographic scintigraphy may be useful in identifying patients at low risk of incurring cardiac events after PKT and may, in a large group of patients, obviate the need for routine coronary angiography."
CD008691,0,19469885,0,Long-term effects of magnesium carbonate on coronary artery calcification and bone mineral density in hemodialysis patients: a pilot study.,"Observational data suggest that elevated magnesium levels in dialysis patients may prevent vascular calcification and in vitro magnesium can prevent hydroxyapatite crystal growth. However, the effects of magnesium on vascular calcification and bone mineral density have not been studied prospectively. Seven chronic hemodialysis patients participated in this open label, prospective pilot study to evaluate the effects of a magnesium-based phosphate binder on coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores and vertebral bone mineral density (V-BMD) in patients with baseline CAC scores >30. Magnesium carbonate/calcium carbonate (elemental Mg: 86 mg/elemental Ca 100 mg) was administered as the principal phosphate binder for a period of 18 months and changes in CAC and V-BMD were measured at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Serum magnesium levels averaged 2.2+/-0.4 mEq/L (range: 1.3-3.9 mEq/L). Phosphorus levels (4.5+/-0.6 mg/dL) were well controlled throughout the 18 months study. Electron beam computed tomography results demonstrated a small not statically significant increase in absolute CAC scores, no significant change in median percent change, and a small none significant change in V-BMD. Magnesium may have a favorable effect on CAC. The long-term effect on bone mineral density remains unclear. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."

CD008691,0,20345390,0,Dialysis patients treated with Epoetin alfa show improved anemia symptoms: A new analysis of the Canadian Erythropoietin Study Group trial.,"The health-related quality of life (HRQOL) claims in the current Epoetin alfa label are based on the reanalyses of the exercise and physical function data from the Canadian Erythropoietin Study Group trial. The reanalysis was done to comply with the Food and Drug Administration's requirement of using statistical methods that are currently standard in evaluating clinical trial data. Presented here are HRQOL results associated with anemia. The Canadian Erythropoietin Study Group trial was a multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effects of Epoetin alfa on HRQOL in anemic hemodialysis patients. A total of 118 patients who were 18-75 years old, on hemodialysis for >3 months, who had a hemoglobin <9.0 g/dL, and did not have coronary artery disease or diabetes mellitus, were randomized to either receive placebo (n=40), or receive intravenous Epoetin alfa to achieve a target hemoglobin of 9.5-11.0 g/dL (n=40) or a target of 11.5-13.0 g/dL (n=38). Patients were followed for 6 months. The two Epoetin alfa-treatment groups were combined for all analyses performed. This post hoc analysis was conducted using an intent-to-treat repeated measures mixed model analysis of variance using Bonferroni's multiplicity correction. The Epoetin alfa-treated group showed a statistically significant improvement in the Kidney Disease Questionnaire symptom of fatigue in comparison with placebo. Additionally, the change in hemoglobin at 2 months was correlated with change in fatigue, energy, shortness of breath, and weakness, but had minimal effect on depression. These analyses confirm previously reported results, which indicate that treating hemodialysis patients with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent improves HRQOL."

CD008691,0,15600258,0,Elevated cardiac troponin T in hemodialysis patients receiving more intravenous iron sucrose.,"Elevated cardiac troponin T (cTnT) has been associated with shorter survival in hemodialysis patients. Moreover, intravenous (IV) iron treatment has been held responsible for oxidative stress and accelerated atherosclerosis in these patients. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between cTnT concentration, IV iron treatment, and parameters of iron status. In addition, parameters of oxidative stress, inflammation, and atherosclerosis were evaluated. Predialysis blood samples of 78 chronic hemodialysis patients were analyzed for cTnT, malondialdehyde, creatine kinase (CK), and CK-isoenzyme MB (CK-MB). In addition, the mean value of predialysis serum samples collected during the last year, were considered for homocysteine, ferritin, iron, iron binding capacity, blood cell counts, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), calcium, phosphate, iPTH, cholesterol, and triglyceride. The quantity of IV iron sucrose administered during the last two years was counted from the patients' files. Echocardiography, all events related to ischemic heart disease, and urine volume were also recorded. Elevated cTnT levels (> or =0.10 ng/mL) were found in 18 patients (23.1%). The amount of iron administered was 2264+/-1871 mg with a range 0-7000 mg. Patients with elevated cTnT levels received more IV iron than those with normal cTnT (3692+/-1771 vs. 1761+/-1595 mg, p<0.001). The serum ferritin level was higher in patients with elevated cTnT (median levels; 477 vs. 288 ng/mL; P<0.05). Patients with elevated cTnT were longer on dialysis compared to those with normal levels (median times; 35.5 vs. 15 months, P<0.01) and regression analysis identified the amount of administered iron as an independent factor for elevated cTnT (P<0.01). Intravenous iron treatment and high ferritin concentration are related to high cTnT level, which has previously been incriminated as a survival marker in hemodialysis patients."
CD008691,0,16534221,0,Percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with end-stage renal disease.,"Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) represent a growing number of patients in the cardiac catheterization laboratories worldwide. This is a consequence of the growing absolute number of ESRD patients in developed countries, better noninvasive diagnostic tools, better catheterization facilities and last-but-not-least better education of referring physicians about the incidence and prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) for patients with ESRD. There is growing evidence of the positive impact of coronary revascularization on long-term outcome of these patients. ESRD patients have a high comorbidity and are therefore better candidates for the less invasive approach using percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) rather than coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). From the view of the interventional cardiologist, ESRD patients represent one of the most challenging patient cohort concerning technical challenges and potential risk of complication for the patient. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) including debulking techniques and stent implantation is the current standard therapy for patients with symptomatic single-vessel disease (SVD) and the preferred therapy for most patients with focal, polyfocal or even diffuse multi-vessel disease (MVD). Coronary bypass surgery is reserved for a decreasing number of patients with mechanically untreatable coronary lesions and unprotected left main stem stenosis. The problem of restenosis and subsequent target lesion revascularization has been decreased to a minimum by the use of drug-eluting stents (DES), even though prospective randomized trials including ESRD patients are lacking. In case of acute coronary syndromes, the need for immediate coronary angiography and subsequent revascularization by means of PCI should be pointed out."
CD008691,0,8379318,0,Radionuclide assessment of left ventricular performance on exercise after external conduit operation.,"Only limited information is available concerning left ventricular (LV) response to exercise after an external conduit operation for cyanotic congenital heart disease. Sixteen patients who had undergone external conduit repair (EC group) were studied with multi-gated cardiac pool imaging using a supine bicycle ergometer on 20 occasions. Six patients with a history of Kawasaki disease without coronary artery stenosis served as controls (control group). Myocardial imaging and cardiac catheterization were also performed in the EC group. There was no significant difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest between the groups. However, on exercise, LVEF of the EC group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Nine patients in the EC group showed a perfusion defect (PD) on 12 occasions. LVEF on exercise of the patients with PD was significantly lower than that of the patients without PD. Furthermore, only the patients with PD showed a LVEF decrease of 5% or more in response to exercise. In the EC group, a significant inverse relationship was demonstrated between right ventricular systolic pressure (RVP) and LVEF response to exercise. However, two out of four patients who underwent external conduit replacement improved their LVEF response to exercise with successful reduction of RVP. These findings indicate that an impaired left ventricular response to exercise was common in patients after external conduit operations. Myocardial damage and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction could be the causes of this left ventricular dysfunction."

CD008691,0,3532789,1,Evaluation of cardiovascular risk for renal transplantation in diabetic patients.,"Cardiovascular disease contributes in a major way to morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease. Sixty patients with type I diabetes were evaluated prior to renal transplantation to determine the risk of cardiovascular complications. On the basis of results of thallium stress testing and/or cardiac catheterization, each patient was assigned to one of five categories. There were no cardiovascular events in the seven patients who had negative results on stress testing. Of the remaining 53 patients, all of whom underwent cardiac catheterization, 30 had normal coronary arteries. None of these 30 patients had any cardiac morbidity, and the two deaths that occurred in this group were not attributable to cardiac causes. Significant coronary artery disease was present in 38 percent of the patients. The overall mortality rate was 5.4 percent in those patients without coronary artery disease and 43.5 percent in those with the disease. In addition, the mortality rate in patients with coronary disease classified as severe was 62 percent, whereas it was 20 percent in those categorized as having moderate disease. The data indicate that patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease who are at highest risk for cardiovascular events can be identified, and these patients probably should not undergo renal transplantation."

They had been on hemodialysis for 1 to 47 months and were being considered for renal transplantation. The controls were 11 normotensive patients (6 men) aged 46.1 +/- 11 years without coronary artery disease (CAD). Ten (31%) patients had significant CAD (5 single vessel, 3 double vessel, 2 triple vessel). Cardiac index (4.57 +/- 1.3 l/min/m2), LV mass (140 +/- 43 g/m2), mean aortic pressure (103 +/- 20 mm Hg), and LV stroke work index (72 +/- 30 g X m/m2) were significantly elevated while stroke index, heart rate, LV ejection fraction, maximum dP/dT, LV end-diastolic volume and LV end-diastolic pressure were normal. The hemodynamic changes did not correlate with the time on maintenance dialysis nor with the duration of treatment for hypertension. Patients with CAD had higher LV mass and mean aortic pressure than those without CAD. The cardiac changes are thought to result from a combination of pressure and volume loads and anemia."
CD008691,0,6482169,0,Dialysis-associated ischemic heart disease: insights from coronary angiography.,"We reviewed the records of 44 dialysis patients who had undergone one or more coronary angiograms to determine the frequency with which symptomatic ischemic heart disease (IHD) and significant coronary artery narrowing coincided and to determine those factors which were associated with the coronary atherosclerotic process. Thirty-four patients were catheterized for angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. Of this group, 53% were found to have significant narrowing of coronary arteries. This group was older than the group with trivial or no coronary artery occlusion and their duration of dialysis was shorter. All the patients with significant coronary occlusion were white and the majority were adult males. Discriminant function analysis revealed that the presence of significant coronary artery occlusion could be predicted with high sensitivity and specificity by the following variables: older age, white race, male sex, the presence of symptomatic IHD prior to the onset of dialysis, increased total serum cholesterol, abnormal left ventricular wall motion, and reduced alkaline phosphatase. We also found that the occurrence of symptomatic IHD far exceeded the presence of significant atherosclerotic coronary artery narrowing. We suggest that this may result from several dialysis-associated alterations in oxygen delivery and myocardial oxygen consumption."
CD008691,0,15577064,0,[Evaluation of coronary artery calcification in ESRD patients].,"Coronary artery calcification (CAC), observed in most end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, has been reported to influence mortality and complications of cardiovascular diseases. Depend on the these reports, K/DOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) guideline recommended to control serum Ca and phosphorus levels strictly in ESRD patients, in order to inhibit the progression of CAC. And then, we have been able to use new phosphate binder, sevelamer which dose not contain calcium and will able to use calcimimetics for secondary hyperparathyroidism as soon. Now, we should evaluate the diseases of bone as well as cardiovascular diseases according to the change of paradigms for renal osteodystrophy. It is undoubted that imaging methods play a main role on the management of CAC and coronary stenosis in end stage renal failure patients. Multidetector-row CT (MDCT) is a most useful imaging method, which has high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution. We may obtain adequate image quality for diagnosis and evaluate in 26 cases (87%), except for 4 cases not evaluated due to severe calcification. Therefore, this study suggested that 16-row MSCT is useful as a screening test for coronary angiography (CAG) even in dialysis patients."

Arterial catheterisms are a common cause. However, the association with an aortic dissection has been exceptionally reported. We report the observation of a 70 year-old man, with coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia. Six months before hospitalization, a coronary angioplasty was performed due to recurrent angina. The association of purpuric lesions on the feet, with acute renal failure confirmed cholesterol embolism syndrome. Transoesophageal echocardiography showed a dissection of the descending thoracic aorta associated with complex atheroma. The evolution was marked by the pulpar necrosis of a toe and by a worsening of the renal failure, requiring definitive hemodialysis. Further echographic control highlighted the rupture of the intimal veil of the dissection. Cholesterol embolism syndrome may reveal an aortic dissection in patients without thoracic symptoms. In such cases, transoesophageal echocardiography is a useful and non-invasive examination."

CD008691,0,18971545,0,Is it time to treat prehypertension?,"Prehypertension, defined as blood pressure between 120-139/80-89 mmHg, is a major public health concern. The condition is very prevalent (30% of the adult population), is often associated with other cardiovascular risk factors and independently increases the risk of hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular events. The mechanism of elevated risk for cardiovascular events associated with prehypertension is presumed to be the same as that of hypertension. In the general population, prehypertension can be lowered by lifestyle modifications, but often not reliably. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7) recommendation for prehypertension management with optimal weight control (largely through diet and exercise) remains the mainstay, except for individuals with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and perhaps known coronary artery disease, because of the shot-term cost considerations and unproven long-term prognosis. The recently published Trial of Preventing Hypertension (TROPHY) is the first study of pharmacologic intervention among those with prehypertension. Results from this trial demonstrated that angiotensin receptor blockade (ARB) retards age-related blood pressure increases in prehypertensive patients. In this review, we discuss the options for pharmacologic intervention of prehypertension, with a focus on the TROPHY trial results."

The cardiovascular mortality of dialysis patients is 10-15 times higher compared with the general population. The aim of our study was to evaluate the morphological progression of coronary arteriosclerosis in this cardiovascular high-risk group by visual assessment and quantitative coronary angiography. Methods and results. In 26 patients with chronic renal failure (age, 47+/-11 years; 15 male; duration of dialysis, 23+/-25 months) the severity of CAD and degree of coronary stenoses were assessed in two coronary angiograms after a mean follow-up interval of 30+/-15 months (12-60). Baseline angiography revealed CAD in 13/22 patients (59%). The second angiography was performed as screening procedure prior to renal transplantation (n=20) and/or as follow-up angiography after coronary angioplasty (n=10). Visual assessment showed a progression defined by the development of haemodynamically relevant stenosis of >50% luminal diameter in 13 patients. Quantitative angiographic evaluation was performed in a total of 45 segments showing >25% narrowing at the second angiogram. A progression (>15% luminal reduction) was found in 17 of 45 segments, a new lesion (initial luminal diameter <20%) was detected in nine segments, resulting in progression or new lesion in 16 patients (62%). Patients with or without progression did not differ in age, duration of dialysis treatment, number of cardiovascular risk factors, or serum total cholesterol and fibrinogen levels. After percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) a restenosis was seen in seven of 16 primarily successfully dilated segments. After the second angiography, myocardial revascularization was performed in eight patients (1 PTCA, 7 coronary artery bypass graft)."
CD008691,0,8023826,1,Prospective risk stratification in renal transplant candidates for cardiac death.,"In previous studies to predict future cardiac death of patients undergoing evaluation for renal transplantation, noninvasive or invasive testing of all, or nearly all, patients has been used. In an attempt to decrease the cost of cardiac risk assessment, we prospectively used a two-tiered cardiac risk assessment algorithm on 189 consecutive patients referred for renal transplant evaluation. First, patients were stratified by clinical characteristics of age > or = 50 years, history of angina, insulin-dependent diabetes, congestive heart failure, or abnormal electrocardiogram (excluding left ventricular hypertrophy). Patients having none of these risk factors (n = 94) were considered at low risk for cardiac events and underwent no further cardiac evaluation. Patients with one or more of the cardiac risk factors (n = 95) were considered to be in a high-risk group and were required to undergo further evaluation with thallium myocardial scintigraphy. Follow-up of patients was for 46 +/- 16 months. Cardiac mortality was significantly higher in the clinical high-risk group compared with the clinical low-risk group (17% v 1%, respectively; P < 0.001). Further cardiac risk stratification was evident by thallium myocardial scintigraphy. Patients with reversible thallium defects had significantly higher cardiac mortality rates than patients with no thallium defects (23% v 5%, respectively; P < 0.05). Fixed thallium defects also had predictive value for cardiac mortality (29%,; P < 0.05), but deaths in this fixed defect group tended to occur later in the follow-up period.

CD008691,0,8546087,1,Evaluation using dobutamine stress echocardiography in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus before kidney and/or pancreas transplantation.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of dobutamine stress echocardiography to stratify patients with juvenile onset, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who are being considered for kidney and/or pancreas transplantation, into high-or low-risk groups for future cardiac events. Fifty-three such patients underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography before kidney and/or pancreas transplantation. Cardiac events, including cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and need for coronary revascularization, occurring between the time of the dobutamine stress echocardiogram and the last patient follow-up contact were retrospectively identified. Twenty patients 938%) had an abnormal dobutamine stress echocardiogram. Eleven patients had 15 cardiac events over a mean (+/- SD) follow-up period of 418 +/- 269 days. Event rates were 45% among those with an abnormal, versus 6% among those with a normal dobutamine stress echocardiogram (p = 0.002). The result of the dobutamine stress test independently predicted prognosis in a multivariate analysis (p = 0.003, odds ratio = 12.7). We conclude that dobutamine stress echocardiography accurately stratifies patients with juvenile onset, insulin-dependent diabetes being considered for kidney and/or pancreas transplantation for risk of future cardiac events."

CD008691,0,7566298,0,"Comparison of Lp(a) concentrations and some potential effects in hemodialysis, CAPD, transplantation, and control groups, and review of the literature.","Apolipoprotein (a)-Lp(a)-is reported to be an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease and for hemodialysis (HD) access occlusion. Homology with plasminogen may predispose to thrombosis. High concentrations usually have been reported in patients on HD and on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), but near-normal values in many kidney transplants (TP). We used Pharmacia immunoradiometric assay in 52 patients on HD, 58 on CAPD, 94 after TP, and 56 controls. The Lp(a) mean levels for CAPD, HD, TP, and control groups were 738, 647, 348, and 368 U/l and the medians were 542, 537, 96 and 143 U/l, respectively. The means and medians for CAPD and HD were significantly greater than those for TP and controls (p < 0.003 for means and < 0.005 for medians). We found no significant difference between: (1) Lp(a) means or medians comparing HD and CAPD or TP and controls; (2) Lp(a) means for the 33 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and the 171 without; (3) number of occlusions of HD fistulae or grafts in patients with high Lp(a) values and without; (4) mean Lp(a) for CAPD patients on gemfibrozil and also for TP patients on 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme 1 reductase inhibitors, or diet alone, before and after treatment, and (5) mean Lp(a) values for HD and CAPD patients with and without myocardial infarction. Lp(a) did not correlate significantly with fractional shortening or left ventricular end systolic or diastolic diameter by echocardiogram or with ejection fraction. For TP patients, Lp(a) and serum creatinine correlated (p = 0.004), and mean Lp(a) for 71 TP on ciclosporin A exceeded that for the other 23 patients (p < 0.03). Lp(a) fell in 13 of 14 patients after TP (mean fall 77%). The dominant Apo(a) isoform in 10 of 13 patients on CAPD or HD with high Lp(a) values was the equivalent of S2 (Utermann). Lp(a) in HD or CAPD is often elevated and regulated by both genetic and renal failure factors, but falls after TP with return of renal function and mainly genetic regulation. Lp(a) was not a risk factor for coronary artery disease in HD or CAPD patients and did not fall significantly with two drugs or diet."
CD008691,0,12819248,0,Is a single time point C-reactive protein predictive of outcome in peritoneal dialysis patients?,"C-reactive protein is the prototype marker of inflammation and has been shown to predict mortality in hemodialysis patients. However, it remains uncertain as to whether a single C-reactive protein level has similar prognostic significance in peritoneal dialysis patients. A single high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level was measured in 246 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients without active infections at study baseline together with indices of dialysis adequacy, echocardiographic parameters (left ventricular mass index, left ventricular dimensions, and ejection fraction), nutrition markers (serum albumin, dietary intake, and subjective global assessment) and biochemical parameters (hemoglobin, lipids, calcium, and phosphate). The cohort was then followed-up prospectively for a median of 24 mo (range, 2 to 34 mo), and outcomes were studied in relation to these parameters. Fifty-nine patients died (36 from cardiovascular causes) during the follow-up period. The median hs-CRP level was 2.84 mg/L (range, 0.20 to 94.24 mg/L). Patients were stratified into tertiles according to baseline hs-CRP, namely those with hs-CRP < or = 1.26 mg/L, 1.27 to 5.54 mg/L, and > or = 5.55 mg/L. Those with higher hs-CRP were significantly older (P < 0.001), had greater body mass index (P < 0.001), higher prevalence of coronary artery disease (P = 0.003), and greater left ventricular mass index (P < 0.001). One-year overall mortality was 3.9% (lower) versus 8.8% (middle) versus 21.3% (upper tertile) (P < 0.0001). Cardiovascular death rate was 2.7% (lower) versus 5.2% (middle) versus 16.2% (upper tertile) (P < 0.0001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that every 1 mg/L increase in hs-CRP was independently predictive of higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.04; P = 0.002) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.05; P = 0.001) in peritoneal dialysis patients. Other significant predictors for all-cause mortality included age (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.10), gender (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.90), atherosclerotic vascular disease (HR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.46 to 4.80), left ventricular mass index (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.01) and residual GFR (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.75). Age (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.10), history of heart failure (HR, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.36 to 8.08), atherosclerotic vascular disease (HR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.43 to 7.13), and residual GFR (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.86) were also independently predictive of cardiovascular mortality. In conclusion, a single, random hs-CRP level has significant and independent prognostic value in PD patients."
CD008691,0,11840363,0,Hemodialysis-associated hypertension: pathophysiology and therapy.,"The majority of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are hypertensive. Hypertension in the hemodialysis patient population is multifactorial. Further, hypertension is associated with an increased risk for left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular complications, and mortality. Antihypertensive medications alone do not adequately control blood pressure (BP) in hemodialysis patients. There are, however, several therapeutic options available to normalize BP in these patients, often without the need for additional drug therapy (eg, long, slow hemodialysis; short, daily hemodialysis; nocturnal hemodialysis; or, most effectively, dietary salt and fluid restriction in combination with reduction of dialysate sodium concentration). Optimal BP in dialysis patients is not different from recommendations for the general population, even though definite evidence is not yet available. Predialysis systolic and diastolic BPs are of particular importance. Left ventricular mass correlates with predialysis systolic BP. Survival is better in hemodialysis patients with a mean arterial pressure below 99 mm Hg as compared with those with higher BP. Low predialysis systolic BP (<110 mm Hg) and low predialysis diastolic BP (<70 mm Hg) are associated with increased mortality, primarily because of severe congestive heart failure or coronary artery disease. Patients that experience repeated intradialytic hypotensive episodes should also be viewed with caution, and predialytic BP values should be reevaluated. A possible treatment option for these patients may be slow, long hemodialysis; short, daily hemodialysis; or nocturnal hemodialysis. Among the antihypertensive agents currently available, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to have the greatest ability to reduce left ventricular mass. Pressure load can be satisfactorily determined by using the average value of predialysis BP measurements over 1 month. In selected hemodialysis patients, interdialytic ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) may help to determine if the patient is in fact hypertensive. In addition, ABPM provides important information about the change in BP between day and night. Regular home BP monitoring, yearly echocardiography, and treatment of traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease are recommended."

CD008691,0,17573191,0,Inhibition of caspases but not of calpains temporarily protect against C2-ceramide-induced death of CAD cells.,"Evidence has implicated apoptosis as a mechanism underlying cell death in diverse neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). Endogenous agents such as TNF-alpha, INF-gamma, IL-1beta and others stress signals activate the sphingomyelin pathway increasing ceramide levels. Ceramide triggers apoptotic pathways while inhibiting survival signalling, and is involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and compartmentalisation. The contribution of caspases in neuronal apoptosis has been highlighted by the increased survival exerted by caspase inhibition, but the involvement of calpains during neuronal apoptosis and the potential benefit of their inhibition is still controversial. In the present paper, we have analysed the contribution of caspases and calpains to cell death of CAD cells, a catecholaminergic cell line of mesencephalic origin, following C2-ceramide exposure. Ceramide caused CAD cell death by a dose and time dependant mechanism. 25microM of C2-ceramide caused apoptosis. Analysis of activation of caspases and calpains by differential cleavage of alpha-fodrin showed that although calpains are activated before caspases following C2-ceramide exposure, only caspase inhibition increased cell survival. These results demonstrate the activation of caspases and calpains in C2-ceramide-induced cell death, and support the role of caspase inhibition as a neuroprotective strategy and a plausible therapeutic approach to decrease catecholaminergic cell death."

An average of 3.9 distal anastomoses (AN) per patient was undertaken, 2.8 using arterial grafts. Two hundred sixty-nine patients (67.2%) received exclusively arterial grafts. Right internal mammary artery (RIMA) grafts were predominantly directed to the left coronary system (348 AN = 78%) and particularly to the circumflex (CX) area. Postoperative myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 16 patients (4%). Reoperation was required for early myocardial ischemia in 12 patients (3%) and for excessive bleeding in 23 patients (5.8%).

No thrombotic or hemorrhagic episode was recorded. Control angiography indicating partial lysis of the left and right intracoronary thrombi led to exact evaluation of the residual underlying stenoses.

It is generally accepted that HUS is, in part, caused by endothelial cell dysfunction. Endothelial cells modulate blood flow, blood pressure, and myointimal proliferation. Endothelial cells synthesize and release products that modulate vascular tone and regulate vascular smooth muscle cell growth. We describe a patient who developed HUS secondary to mitomycin C, resulting in end-stage renal disease and necessitating chronic hemodialysis. Over several months, the patient subsequently developed multisystem organ failure involving the heart, liver, and intestine that was associated with angiographically documented small, distal vessel occlusive disease and ultrasonographically identified coronary artery intimal hyperplasia. We propose that a diffuse ongoing endothelial cell dysfunction (ie, endotheliopathy) is the putative mechanism for this patient's clinical course.

CD008691,0,9914952,0,[Elevated levels of plasma homocysteine related to saphenous vein graft disease after coronary artery bypass graft surgery].,"Elevated levels of plasma homocysteine may be an independent risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis. This study investigated whether plasma homocysteine levels are related to atherosclerotic lesions of saphenous vein grafts after coronary artery bypass surgery. Homocysteine levels were measured in fasting plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography and total cholesterol, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein (a) were also evaluated in 40 patients (mean age 65 +/- 8 years, mean interval after bypass surgery: 6.1 +/- 3.1 years, range 1-13 years). The vein graft disease group was defined as patients with angiographical stenosis of > or = 50% in any vein graft (n = 23). The other patients were defined as the no-vein graft disease group (n = 17). Patients who had a history of chronic renal failure or anatomic lesions of saphenous vein grafts were excluded. The distributions of homocysteine were skewed. Median homocysteine levels were 11.9 nmol/ml in all subjects. Homocysteine levels in the vein graft disease group were significantly higher than in the no-vein graft disease group (median 15.1 vs 10.6 nmol/ml, p = 0.01). In the analysis of plasma lipids, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly lower in the vein graft disease group than in the no-vein graft disease group (mean 37 +/- 11 vs 48 +/- 13 mg/dl, p = 0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed that elevated levels of homocysteine were an independent risk factor for saphenous vein graft disease after coronary artery bypass surgery. These findings indicate that elevated levels of plasma homocysteine are related to atherosclerotic lesions of saphenous vein grafts after coronary artery bypass surgery as well as coronary atherosclerosis."

CD008691,0,20715464,0,[Usefulness of photo dynamic eye system for detection of graft spasm in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting].,"A 54-year-old-man on hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital because of effort angina. A coronary angiography revealed multiple stenoses including 90% stenosis in the left main trunk. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed with Y-composite grafts constructed by the right internal thoracic artery (RITA) and the free gastroepiploic artery (GEA) which were anastomosed to left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the diagonal branch (D1) using the off-pump technique. After completion of anastomosis, Photo Dynamic Eye (PDE) system showed fluorescence not in the free GEA but at the anastomotic site of GEA to D1. Because the graft spasm of GEA was diagnosed by PDE, papaverine solution was sprayed to the graft, which resolved the spasm and re-anastomosis was avoided. PDE system is a useful tool for the diagnosis of graft spasm, and may contribute to improvement of quality of CABG."
CD008691,0,2787845,0,Value of rest-stress myocardial positron tomography using nitrogen-13 ammonia for the preoperative prediction of reversible asynergy.,"To determine the predictive value of stress [13N]ammonia positron emission tomography (PET) for reversible ischemia, 31 patients with coronary artery disease underwent rest-stress [13N]ammonia PET before and after coronary artery bypass surgery. The circumferential profile analysis was applied to determine the presence of transient defect (TD) and persistent defect (PD) preoperatively, and the fate of perfusion abnormality and asynergy after the surgery was assessed. Preoperative PET demonstrated 100 segments with perfusion abnormalities, including 69 TD and 31 PD. Fifty-six of the 69 TD (81%) improved in regional perfusion, while only four of 31 PD (13%) improved in perfusion postoperatively (p less than 0.001). Of 75 segments showing regional asynergy on contrast or radionuclide ventriculography preoperatively, 34 of 48 segments with TD (71%) improved in asynergy, while only five of 27 segments with PD (19%) improved in asynergy postoperatively (p less than 0.001). Stress-delayed 201TI tomography was performed in 22 of them. The predictive values for improvement in perfusion (77%) and asynergy (65%) were similar as those by [13N]ammonia PET (81% and 71%, respectively). However, the predictive values for no improvement in perfusion and asynergy by 201TI tended to be low (66% and 58%, respectively), as compared to those in 13N ammonia PET (87%; p less than 0.05 and 81%; p = 0.09, respectively). We conclude that an accurate prediction of reversible ischemia and asynergy can be achieved with rest-stress [13N]ammonia PET. Particularly, it can identify irreversible areas more accurately than the commonly performed stress-delayed 201TI imaging."
CD008691,0,1934671,0,Myocardial revascularization in patients on renal replacement therapy.,"Coronary disease is the main cause of mortality and morbidity among long-term survivors on renal replacement therapy (RRT). Despite the additional risk factors, myocardial revascularization has been recently attempted with various success in some patients on RRT. We report on 26 patients (13 dialyzed and 13 transplanted, mean age: 50 years [range 38-66]) who have undergone either surgical aorto-coronary bypass (CABG) (n = 16) with mammary artery grafts, or percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) (n = 9), or both procedures (n = 2). Indication was angina pectoris in all but three patients with painless ischemia. Eight patients had unstable angina (NYHA class IV). A previous myocardial infarction was documented in 11 cases. Coronary angiography disclosed mainly multiple vessel disease (81%). Post CABG complications consisted of severe intrathoracic bleeding (n = 3) resulting in death in 2 cases. PTCA entailed no major complication. After the critical postoperative period, the long-term survival was the same as that of non-uremic patients and the clinical improvement, according to the NYHA classification, was highly satisfactory at 6 months and persists up to 2 years. We conclude that coronary angiography and myocardial revascularization should be considered in patients on long-term RRT developing coronary disease."
CD008691,0,8657415,0,[Simultaneous heart valve implantation and coronary bypass following kidney transplantation].,"The authors report simultaneous aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery successfully performed in a patient with functioning transplanted kidney. The patient's cardiac status was classified as NYHA class III. The indication of the cardiac operation was a heavily calcified, stenotic and insufficient aortic valve and severe coronary artery disease. Renal function and blood biochemistry tests did not show significant changes in the postoperative period. The patient was discharged on the 15. postoperative day after an uneventful postoperative period. He remained asymptotic for two and a half years after operation. His cardiac status judged by postoperative treadmill stress was NYHA class I. The outcome of this case in accordance with results found in the literature further confirms that, if the clinical indications are appropriate, a kidney transplant patient can survive and benefit from cardiac surgery. To our knowledge our patient has been the only one who has survived aortic valve replacement and double coronary artery bypass grafting after kidney transplantation, and this is the first case that has ever been reported in Hungary."

CD008691,0,18489931,0,"Incidence, predictors, and outcomes of post-percutaneous coronary intervention nephropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus and normal baseline serum creatinine levels.","Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of nephropathy after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The outcomes of patients with diabetes with normal baseline serum creatinine who undergo PCI remain underevaluated. The aim of the present study was to assess the incidence, outcomes, and correlates of post-PCI nephropathy in this subset. The study cohort consisted of 570 patients with diabetes with normal serum creatinine (< or =1.3 mg/dl) who underwent PCI from August 2004 to December 2006. Patients aged >75 years and those presenting with either acute myocardial infarctions or cardiogenic shock were excluded. Post-PCI nephropathy was defined as a > or =25% increase in baseline creatinine. The study end points were post-PCI nephropathy and major adverse cardiac events at 6 months. Logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors. Post-PCI nephropathy occurred in 70 patients (incidence 12.3%). These patients were more likely to be women (55.7% vs 35.5%, p = 0.001) and to have histories of congestive heart failure (24.2% vs 14.7%, p = 0.048). Entry-site complications (hematoma, pseudoaneurysm) and the need for blood transfusion (16.7% vs 1.7%, p <0.001) were more common in this group. In-hospital mortality (8.6% vs 0.2%, p <0.001) and length of stay (4.51 +/- 5.2 vs 2.23 +/- 2.9 days, p <0.001) were significantly higher in the group with post-PCI nephropathy. No study patient required dialysis. At 6 months, major adverse cardiac events were markedly higher in patients with post-PCI nephropathy (21.4% vs 6.0%, p <0.001), driven by death and revascularization. Independent predictors of post-PCI nephropathy were lower body mass index and blood transfusion. Post-PCI nephropathy independently predicted major adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval 2.1 to 8.6, p <0.001). In conclusion, post-PCI nephropathy occurred in 12.3% of patients with diabetes with normal baseline serum creatinine and carried a significant detrimental impact on prognosis. The requirement for blood transfusions was the strongest correlate identified."

Thirty-three patients at high risk for coronary artery disease were selected from a cohort of 133 renal transplant candidates and underwent both DSE and CA. In this study, the value of DSE was found to exist in its strong negative predictive value (92%). A negative DSE coupled with a negative clinical cardiac evaluation was found to practicably exclude the necessity for CA. DSE can thus serve as a non-invasive, low cost screening test."
CD008691,0,20186233,0,Mesenchymal stem cells: a new therapeutic tool for AKI.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical complication, associated with poor outcomes and the development of chronic kidney disease. Despite major advances in the understanding of its pathophysiology, available therapies for AKI are only supportive; therefore, adequate functional recovery from AKI must predominantly rely on the kidney's own reparative ability. An extensive body of preclinical data from our own and from other laboratories has shown that administration of adult multipotent marrow stromal cells (commonly referred to as mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs]), effectively ameliorates experimental AKI by exerting paracrine renoprotective effects and by stimulating tissue repair. Based on these findings, a clinical trial has been conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of MSCs administered to open-heart surgery patients who are at high risk of postoperative AKI. In this Perspectives article, we discuss some of the early data from this trial and describe potential applications for stem cell therapies in other fields of nephrology."

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of CAD in a national random sample of new ESRD in the United States in 1996/1997 (n = 4025). Data on demographic characteristics and comorbidities were obtained from the Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study, Wave 2. The principal outcome was CAD, defined as the presence of a previous history of CAD, myocardial infarction, or angina, coronary artery bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty, or abnormal coronary angiographic findings. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship of conventional factors and proposed uremic factors to the presence of CAD. CAD was present in 38% of patients. Of the total cohort, 17% had a history of myocardial infarction and 23% had angina. Several conventional risk factors, including advancing age, male gender, diabetes mellitus, and smoking, were significantly associated with CAD. Of the proposed uremic factors, lower serum albumin levels but higher residual renal function and higher hematocrit values were significantly associated with the presence of CAD. Vascular comorbid conditions, structural cardiac abnormalities, white race, and geographic location were also strongly correlated with the presence of CAD. This national study suggests that several conventional CAD risk factors may also be risk factors for CAD among the ESRD population. This study identifies nonconventional factors such as serum albumin levels, vascular comorbid conditions, and structural cardiac abnormalities as important disease correlates. Future logitudinal studies are required to explore the relative importance of the relationships observed here."
CD008691,0,16988062,0,Risk equation determining unsuccessful cannulation events and failure to maturation in arteriovenous fistulas (REDUCE FTM I).,"Fistulas are the preferred permanent hemodialysis vascular access but a significant obstacle to increasing their prevalence is the fistula's high ""failure to mature"" (FTM) rate. This study aimed to (1) identify preoperative clinical characteristics that are predictive of fistula FTM and (2) use these predictive factors to develop and validate a scoring system to stratify the patient's risk for FTM. From a derivation set of 422 patients who had a first fistula created, a prediction rule was created using multivariate stepwise logistic regression. The model was internally validated using split-half cross-validation and bootstrapping techniques. A simple scoring system was derived and externally validated on 445 different, prospective patients who received a new fistula at five large North American dialysis centers. The clinical predictors that were associated with FTM were aged > or =65 yr (odds ratio [OR] 2.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25 to 3.96), peripheral vascular disease (OR 2.97; 95% CI 1.34 to 6.57), coronary artery disease (OR 2.83; 95% CI 1.60 to 5.00), and white race (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.75). The resulting scoring system, which was externally validated in 445 patients, had four risk categories for fistula FTM: low (24%), moderate (34%), high (50%), and very high (69%; trend P < 0.0001). A preoperative, clinical prediction rule to determine fistulas that are likely to fail maturation was created and rigorously validated. It was found to be simple and easily reproducible and applied to predictive risk categories. These categories predicted risk of FTM to be 24, 34, 50, and 69% and are dependent on age, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and race. The clinical utility of these risk categories in increasing rates of permanent accesses requires further clinical evaluation."

We determined the relationship between ethnic and sex differences in access to cardiac procedures as patients progress to ESRD and acquire Medicare insurance. We performed a cohort study of a nationwide random sample of 4,987 patients who progressed to ESRD in 1986 to 1987 and were followed up for 7 years was used. Data were collected from medical charts and Medicare administrative records. Pre-ESRD, the odds of cardiac procedure use were much lower for white women (adjusted odds 0.67 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-0.92]), black men (adjusted odds 0.32 [95% CI 0.20-0.49]), and black women (adjusted odds 0.30 [95%CI 0.18-0.50]) compared with white men. After initiating dialysis therapy, the ethnic and sex differences decreased with odds of receiving a cardiac procedure compared with white men 0.88 (95% CI 0.63-1.21) for white women, 0.66 (95% CI 0.47-0.92) for black men, and 0.75 (95% CI 0.53-1.08) for black women. Patients uninsured pre-ESRD had the largest increase in procedure rates at follow-up. The wide pre-ESRD disparities in cardiac procedure use between white women, black men, and black women compared with white men narrowed substantially with acquisition of Medicare and entry into comprehensive dialysis care. Health insurance contributed to the narrowing of differences. Procedure use for black men still lagged behind the other groups, suggesting the need for closer examination of health needs in this potentially vulnerable group."

Children who have undergone successful kidney transplantation are entering young adulthood; however, the prevalence and extent of CAD in this population is unknown. We conducted a pilot study in young adults with stable allograft function, who received kidney transplants as children to measure coronary artery calcification (CAC), a marker of coronary artery atherosclerosis and CAD. We evaluated 19 young adults after successful pediatric kidney transplantation for known CAD risk factors; these patients underwent noninvasive imaging with electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) for measurement of CAC. Prevalence and quantity of CAC were then compared to asymptomatic individuals from the community. All patients had multiple risk factors for CAD. Mean age at evaluation was 32 years (range: 21-48 years). CAC is uncommon in individuals in the community in this age range; however, nearly half of our patients had CAC detected with the quantity of CAC comparable to asymptomatic individuals from the community 10-40 years older. These data suggest young adults who received pediatric kidney transplants are at increased risk for developing early CAC and need close monitoring to detect early CAD so as to prevent premature cardiac morbidity and mortality."

CD008691,0,16269994,0,Cardiovascular risk in patients with mild renal insufficiency: implications for the use of ACE inhibitors.,"We review the evidence linking mild renal insufficiency (MRI) with increased cardiovascular risk. MRI is associated with a number of cardiovascular risk factors, including nighttime hypertension, and increased levels of lipoprotein (a), homocysteine, asymmetric dimethyl-arginine, and inflammation and insulin resistance markers and mediators. Epidemiologic evidence associates coronary artery disease and nephrosclerosis, a frequent cause of early renal insufficiency in the elderly. In a middle-aged general population MRI was found in 8% of women and 9% of men, but was not associated with cardiovascular disease. Nonetheless, in a representative sample of middle-aged British men the risk of stroke was 60% higher for the sub-group with MRI: in people at high cardiovascular risk (mostly coronary disease), the HOPE study found a 2-fold (unadjusted) or 1.4-fold (adjusted) higher incidence of cardiovascular outcomes with MRI. The combined incidence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke increased with the level of serum creatinine. Several studies have examined the cardiovascular risk associated with MRI in hypertension. In HDFP, as in HOPE, cardiovascular mortality increased with serum creatinine (five-fold difference in cardiovascular mortality between the lowest and the highest creatinine strata). The risk associated with renal insufficiency was independent of other classic cardiovascular risk factors. Two trials of hypertensives with low risk (HOT and a small Italian trial) found that cardiovascular outcomes approximately doubled in subjects with MRI. Another study (MRFIT) found that it was not baseline creatinine, but its increase on follow-up that predicted future cardiovascular disease. These observational data suggest that regardless of etiology MRI is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease and is found in 10% of populations at low cardiovascular risk and in up to 30% of those at high risk. No prospective therapeutic trials aimed at reducing the cardiovascular burden in people with MRI are available. Subgroup analyses of the HOPE study indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with ramipril is beneficial and does not increase the risk of such side effects as acute renal failure or hyperkalemia. Thus the frequent practice of withholding ACE inhibitors from patients with mild renal insufficiency is unwarranted, especially since MRI identifies a group at high risk that appears to benefit most from treatment. Moreover, there is evidence that ACE inhibitors improve renal outcomes in renal insufficiency. Prospective studies should test the predictive power of early renal insufficiency for cardiovascular disease and prognosis with various therapeutic options."
CD008691,0,8159304,0,"Long-term efficiency, biocompatibility, and clinical safety of combined simultaneous LDL-apheresis and haemodialysis in patients with hypercholesterolaemia and end-stage renal failure.","Three hypercholesterolaemic patients on maintenance haemodialysis with angiographically proven coronary artery disease were treated in a once-a-week schedule by combined, synchronous lipid apheresis (using heparin-induced extracorporeal LDL precipitation) and haemodialysis (HELP/HD) for 65-104 weeks. Clinical side-effects were few and mostly related to high ultrafiltration rates in patients with low compliance regarding interdialytic fluid restriction. Biocompatibility of the procedure was shown to be good and blood cell losses, leukocyte (elastase release) and thrombocyte (beta-thromboglobulin extrusion) as well as complement (C3a formation) activation were minimal. Interestingly, most of the C3a generated in the extracorporeal HELP circuit was immediately removed again in the precipitate filter. In the pseudo-steady-state after 3 months of regular therapy, acute haematocrit-corrected reduction of plasma components after the session compared to pre values were about 55% for the risk factors LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), and fibrinogen (FIB) with good recovery of HDL-C and other proteins. Urea, creatinine, and phosphate elimination was similar to normal haemodialysis. Mean interapheresis values of risk factors after one (n = 2) and two (n = 1) years of treatment were crucially dependent upon ultrafiltration (UF); thus, in two patients with high UF LDL-C concentrations amounting to 185 and 220 mg/dl at baseline and were reduced to about 135 mg/dl LDL-C, while in the patient with low UF the reduction was from 231 mg/dl to 80 mg/dl.

CD008691,0,9893112,0,Renal disease and hypertension in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.,"Recent epidemiologic data demonstrate a dramatic increase in the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), thus dispelling the mistaken belief that renal prognosis is benign in NIDDM. Currently, the leading cause of ESRD in the United States, Japan, and in most industrialized Europe is NIDDM, accounting for nearly 90% of all cases of diabetes. In addition to profound economic costs, patients with NIDDM and diabetic nephropathy have a dramatically increased morbidity and premature mortality. NIDDM-related nephropathy varies widely among racial and ethnic groups, genders and lifestyles; and gender may interact with race to affect the disease progression. While the course of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) progresses through well-defined stages, the natural history of NIDDM is less well characterized. NIDDM patients with coronary heart disease have a higher urinary albumin excretion rate at the time of diagnosis and follow-up. This greater risk may also be associated with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and genes involved in blood pressure are obvious candidate genes for diabetic nephropathy. Hyperglycemia appears to be an important factor in the development of proteinuria in NIDDM, but its role and the influence of diet are not yet clear. Tobacco smoking can also be deleterious to the diabetic patient, and is also associated with disease progression. Maintaining euglycemia, stopping smoking and controlling blood pressure may prevent or slow the progression of NIDDM-related nephropathy and reduce extrarenal injury. Treatment recommendations include early screening for hyperlipidemia, appropriate exercise and a healthy diet. Cornerstones of management should also include: (1) educating the medical community and more widely disseminating data supporting the value of early treatment of microalbuminuria; (2) developing a comprehensive, multidisciplinary team approach that involves physicians, nurses, diabetes educators and behavioral therapists; and (3) intensifying research in this field."
CD008691,0,16214439,0,Myocardial perfusion study of panic attacks in patients with coronary artery disease.,"Panic disorder (PD) and panic-like anxiety have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death. No study has specifically examined the association between panic attacks and ischemia in patients who have coronary artery disease (CAD). We hypothesized that panic attacks would induce myocardial perfusion defects in patients who have CAD and PD. Sixty-five patients who had CAD and positive results with nuclear exercise stress testing (35 with PD and 30 without PD served as controls) underwent a well-established panic challenge test (1 vital capacity inhalation of a gas mixture containing 35% carbon dioxide and 65% oxygen) and were injected with technetium-99m sestamibi at inhalation. Single-photon emission computed tomography was used to assess per-panic challenge perfusion defects, and heart rate, blood pressure, and 12-lead electrocardiogram were continuously measured during the procedure. Patients were not withdrawn from their cardiac medications. Patients who had PD were significantly younger than the controls; otherwise groups did not differ with respect to gender, cardiac medications, nuclear exercise test results, and baseline heart rate and blood pressure. Seventy-four percent of patients (26 of 35) who had PD had a panic attack at inhalation versus 6.7% of controls (2 of 30, p <0.001). As hypothesized, patients who had PD and demonstrated a panic attack were more likely to develop a reversible myocardial perfusion defect than were controls who did not have an attack (80.9% vs 46.4% p = 0.009). Thus, despite being on their cardiac medications, panic attacks preferentially induced significant perfusion defects in patients who had CAD and PD. In conclusion, panic attacks in patients who have CAD appear to be bad for the heart."

There is substantial support to the hypothesis that low levels of serum PTH in haemodialysis patients are associated with increased vascular and cardiac calcium deposits, due to decreased buffering capacity of bone in low turnover osteodystrophy. The present study has been carried out on a cohort of patients on haemodialysis, with exclusion of previously parathyroidectomized patients, with the aim to evaluate the association between PTH serum levels and coronary calcifications."
CD008691,0,15799174,0,The prevalence and clinical predictors of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients undergoing coronary angiography.,"Renal artery stenosis is an important cause of secondary hypertension as well as ischemic nephropathy. The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical predictors in patients with renal artery stenosis in a population referred for coronary angiography. From March 1998 to July 1999, 1459 patients undergoing coronary angiography for various indications were routinely screened for renal artery stenosis by undergoing abdominal aortography. Coronary angiography, carotid angiography, and abdominal aortography was performed via either the radial or the femoral approach. The data were analyzed retrospectively. Out of 1459 patients undergoing abdominal aortography, 158 (10.8%) were found to have significant renal artery stenosis with 24 of the patients having bilateral stenosis. Significant coronary artery diseases were found in 994 of the 1459 study population (68.1%), with 134 (13.5%) of these patients having concomitant renal artery stenosis. Multivariate logistic regression showed that extracranial carotid artery stenosis odds ratio [(OR) 4.89 (95% confidence interval 2.57-9.33), P < 0.001], peripheral artery disease [OR 4.64 (2.65-9.33), P < 0.001], renal insufficiency [OR 2.68 (1.43-5.02), P = 0.002], significant coronary artery disease [OR 2.01 (1.12-3.59), P = 0.019], hypercholesterolemia [OR 1.92 (1.07-3.43), P = 0.028], hypertension [OR 1.85 (1.16-2.95), P = 0.010], and old age (> 60 years) [OR 1.64 (1.01-2.64), P = 0.044] were significant clinical predictors of renovascular disease. The prevalence of indolent atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is relatively high in selected groups of patients with high clincial risk factors for this underdiagnosed disease. Renal artery stenosis should be highly suspected in patients who have these risk factors because early detection of this disease may reverse the progression to chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease."

CD008691,0,20653359,0,Effects of lipid-lowering therapy on reduction of cardiovascular events in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis.,"In the general population, dyslipidemia is an established independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), comorbid cardiovascular disease is present at alarming rates, and those who require hemodialysis and have cardiovascular disease continue to have a high mortality rate. Lipid abnormalities associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) vary depending on the stage of disease (stages 1-5), but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) has been established as the primary lipid treatment target. Guidelines support an LDL level of less than 100 mg/dl in patients with all stages of CKD, except when the triglyceride level is above 500 mg/dl. As patients progress to stage 5 CKD (ESRD with hemodialysis), the high triglyceride, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased lipoprotein(a) levels of the early stages become more pronounced, with increases in small dense LDL particles; however, total cholesterol and LDL values remain normal or decrease. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, lipid abnormalities are driven by an increase in hepatic secretion and delayed catabolism of very low-density lipoproteins, as well as a reduction in lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase. Epidemiologic data support the role of cholesterol lowering as a means to lower cardiovascular events in the hemodialysis population. We conducted a literature search of various databases (1966-September 2009) to identify relevant clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of multiple lipid-lowering agents for the treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis. Only those trials that used clinical primary end points of coronary heart disease (e.g., cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke) were included in this review. Evidence demonstrates that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy (i.e., atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) significantly reduces surrogate cardiovascular markers, particularly LDL, in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis; however, no statin has proved to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in this population. Trials evaluating omega-3 fatty acids did not show significant reductions in LDL or cardiovascular events in this population. Clinicians should appreciate these limitations when deciding whether to continue lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy in these patients, depending on their overall cardiovascular risk assessment."

CD008691,0,2143353,0,"Outcome of congestive heart failure, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic hyperkinetic disease, and ischemic heart disease in dialysis patients.","Congestive heart failure in dialysis patients is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic hyperkinetic disease and ischemic heart disease. To determine the natural history of these four diseases, 150 dialysis patients were prospectively followed for 3-5 years. The 2-year cumulative survival rate was 33% in those with recurrent or persistent congestive heart failure vs. 80% in dialysis patients without. Survival was significantly worse in patients with an echocardiographic diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy compared to patients with normal echo-cardiogram (2-year survival rate 67 vs. 90%). In hypertrophic hyperkinetic disease the 2-year survival rate was 30% after entry into the study, and 43% after first admission with congestive heart failure. Symptomatic ischemic heart disease did not have an adverse impact on mortality when compared to those without ischemic heart disease. We conclude that congestive heart failure in dialysis patients has a bad prognosis. Its associated disorders include dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic hyperkinetic disease, the latter being associated with a high mortality. As the prognosis for patients with overt ischemic heart disease was not different from patients without, it is likely that the underlying cardiomyopathy directly influenced survival."

CD008691,0,2525969,0,Atheroembolic renal disease: association with renal arterial stenosis.,"In elderly patients with generalized atherosclerosis and longstanding hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency should suggest renal artery occlusive disease and/or renal cholesterol embolization. Renal cholesterol embolization is not an absolute contraindication to successful surgical revascularization. Renal cholesterol emboli were identified in biopsy specimens obtained in 24 cases at the Cleveland Clinic from 1978 to 1986, and renal artery stenosis was an associated finding in 19. Clinical manifestations of generalized atherosclerosis were common, including ileofemoral atherosclerosis (18), coronary artery disease (16), carotid occlusive disease (15), and carotid occlusive disease with a history of stroke (8). Evidence of embolic events in other organs was common. Hypertension worsened before biopsy in 21 patients with and without renal artery stenosis. Surgery or angiography definitely or probably contributed to renal failure in 16. Of 12 who underwent surgical revascularization of a renal artery, renal function improved in five, remained stable in five, and worsened in one. Renal function improved in the three patients undergoing dialysis before revascularization, and two were able to discontinue dialysis."

The aim of the study was to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of thallium myocardial imaging after dipyridamole combined with exercise. Forty two chronic dialysis patients (34 men, 8 women) aged 55 +/- 11 years (range: 36 to 75) without symptom of angina nor myocardial infarction were studied. In each patient, an echocardiography, a myocardial scintigraphy with dipyridamole combined with symptom-limited exercise, and coronarography were performed. A coronary heart disease was diagnosed by coronarography in 10 patients (4.5 and 1 respectively with 1, 2 and 3 vessels diseased). Echocardiography detected a left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in 26 patients and a regional asynergia in 14 patients. A positive scintigraphy was present in 11 patients. Three false-positive and 2 false-negative on scintigraphy were noted. Sensibility, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were respectively evaluated at 80, 73, 73 and 93%. All the five patients with either false-positive or false-negative scintigraphy exhibited a LVH. CONCLUSION. In chronic dialysis patients, coronary heart disease may be detected by thallium myocardial imaging after dipyridamole combined with exercise."

CD008691,0,1837116,0,[Coronary ischemia after kidney transplantation in patients over 60 years of age].,"Many elderly patients (aged over 60) are waiting for renal allograft but are considered a risk population for myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death. Between 1987 and January 1st, 1990, 22 elderly patients (16 men and 6 women; mean age 63.4 +/- 0.7 years; range 60-69 years) underwent cadaveric kidney transplantation. Twenty patients had been on haemodialysis for 4.8 +/- 1 years (range: 1-16.3), one had been on peritoneal dialysis for 5 years and one had developed chronic rejection of a previous cadaveric allograft. Among these 22 patients, 6 (27 percent) developed antibodies directed against the random lymphocyte panel and one had a second transplant. Cardiovascular risk factors were systematically estimated, including medical history, cervical arterial Doppler, echocardiography and stress thallium testing (STT). Coronary angiography was performed if there was evidence of myocardial ischaemia. STT did not show any coronary disease in 16 patients and was not maximal (less than 60 percent of maximal theoretical stress) in 4 patients. In 2 patients, STT showed myocardial ischaemia: one, with a history of angina, underwent coronary angiography and angioplasty; the other had silent ischaemia and refused coronary angiography. Two patients died of myocardial infarction. One of them was the patient with silent ischaemia and positive STT test. The patient with angioplasty had a successful transplantation 20 months later, without any cardiovascular complication. After 9 to 32 months of follow-up, 19 patients have functioning allografts (mean serum creatinine level 151 +/- 6 mumol/l). One patient lost his kidney from urinary fistula. Eight patients (36 percent) developed acute rejection and all responded to intravenous corticosteroids. No immunological transplant loss was observed. After 18 months, the graft actuarial survival rate was 85 percent. We conclude that elderly patients free of clinical or silent myocardial ischaemia are good transplant recipients. The cardiovascular risk could be prevented by using STT during the pretransplant screening. If the STT is not maximal or shows coronary ischaemia, coronary angiography is mandatory."
CD008691,0,7982418,0,Hyperhomocysteinaemia in heart transplant recipients.,"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinaemia in cardiac transplant recipients. Three groups of subjects were studied: 27 heart transplant recipients, 14 to 63 months (mean = 36.5) after transplantation; 10 patients with moderate chronic renal insufficiency without clinical evidence of vascular disease; 17 apparently healthy individuals. Twenty-five out of 27 transplanted patients had a coronaroangiography within 6 months of homocysteine measurement. Plasma homocysteine was measured both while the subject was fasting (t0) and 6 h after administration of 0.1 g.kg-1 of methionine (t6). Hyperhomocysteinaemia was present in 14/27 fasting transplanted patients and after methionine loading. Mean plasma levels of homocysteine at t0 were higher (P = 0.03) in transplanted heart recipients (15.4 +/- 7 mumol.l-1) than in the renal patients (9.9 +/- 5 mumol.l-1) despite similar mean plasma creatinin. In eight transplanted patients with angiographic coronary abnormalities of the cardiac graft, homocysteinaemia was at t0 17.1 +/- 9 mumol.l-1 and at t6 47.8 +/- 25 mumol.l-1. In 17 transplanted patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries, plasma homocysteine levels were at t0, 13.2 +/- 4 mumol.l-1 and at t6, 46.8 +/- 25 mumol.l-1. We conclude that hyperhomocysteinaemia is common in transplanted heart recipients, and partly related to renal insufficiency. No correlation was found between hyperhomocysteinaemia and angiographic evidence of coronary atherosclerosis of the graft, but the population of the study was possibly too small to establish this correlation."
CD008691,0,12617333,1,Relationship between elevated serum troponin values in end-stage renal disease patients and abnormal isotopic cardiac scans following stress.,"One hundred asymptomatic high-risk renal transplant candidates were screened for asymptomatic coronary artery disease using stress cardiac isotopic imaging. The cardiac markers, serum cTnT, cTnI, and CKMB, were collected pre and post stress testing. Of the 99 patients whose cardiac scans were technically satisfactory, 32 were normal, 49 had a definite imaging abnormality and the scan was indeterminate in the remaining 18 patients. Based on these results, patients were stratified into either normal, indeterminate or abnormal scan groups. They then were analyzed to detect any correlations between cardiac perfusion defects and either elevated pre-stress cardiac markers or consistent changes 24h after stress testing. While the mean pre-stress serum values for both cardiac troponin T (0.117 +/- 0.12 microgram/L) and cardiac troponin I (0.235 +/- 0.89 microgram/L) were increased in the abnormal cardiac scan group, only the cTnT value proved to differ significantly from the normal group (p < 0.01). For the indeterminate group neither marker was different from the normal scan group. Only an elevated serum cTnT > 0.1 microgram/L (OR 3.042, p = 0.030) proved to discriminate an abnormal scan in this population. It is concluded that the increase in pre-stress serum cTnT encountered in patients with chronic renal failure, with or without evidence of overt, symptomatic coronary artery disease, may represent a combination of subclinical myocardial damage and a prolonged half-life of the marker in the serum. Because of the frequency of elevated serum concentrations of cTnT and, to a lesser degree cTnI, the physician should exercise caution when interpreting a single elevated Troponin value during the evaluation of chest pain in patients with end-stage renal disease. A cTnT > 0.1 microgram/L increases the likelihood of finding significant coronary artery disease three fold in high-risk ESRD patients being evaluated for renal transplantation."

Natural history based on 52 histologically proven cases.,"Atheromatous plaque material containing cholesterol crystals may dislodge and cause distal ischemia. To characterize atheroembolic renal failure, we retrospectively evaluated all patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital from 1981 to 1990 with both renal failure and histologically proven atheroembolism after angiography or cardiovascular surgery. Over the 10-year period, 52 patients were identified. They tended to be elderly men with a history of hypertension (81%), coronary artery disease (73%), peripheral vascular disease (69%), and current smoking (50%). Within 30 days of their procedure, only 50% of patients had cutaneous signs of atheroembolism, and 14% had documented blood eosinophilia. Urinalysis was often abnormal. Hemodynamically unstable patients died shortly after their procedure, yet renal function in the remainder continued to decline over 3 to 8 weeks. Patients who received dialysis had a higher baseline serum creatinine than those who did not (168 +/- 44 mumol/L versus 133 +/- 18 mumol/L, p = 0.02), with dialysis starting a median of 29 days after the procedure. Patients with renal failure due to atheroembolism alone, as opposed to multiple renal insults, were more likely to recover renal function (24% versus 3%, p = 0.03) and had a lower risk of death during the 6 months after their procedure (log-rank p = 0.002). Renal failure due to procedure-induced AE is characterized by a decline in renal function over 3 to 8 weeks. This time course is not consistent with most other iatrogenic causes of renal failure, such as radiocontrast or nephrotoxic medications, which present earlier and often resolve within 2 to 3 weeks after appropriate intervention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

COLD was diagnosed in 346 patients (group 1), COLD and CHD in 402 (group 2), CHD in 211 (group 3). The methods included X-ray studies (survey and excretory urography), functional diagnostics (ECG, Doppler cardiography, assessment of external respiration, abdominal, renal, and bladder ultrasound, measurements of residual urine, transrectal and transabdominal examination of prostate). The glomerular filtration rate was estimated using Cockcrofft-Gault and MDRD formulas and Rerberg- Tareev method, renal hemodynamics by duplex scanning of renal arteries. Inflammatory urogenital diseases were most frequently diagnosed in group 2 (chronic cystitis 83.8%, chronic pyelonephritis 73.9%). Diabetic nephropathy common in this group (25.4%) was related to the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in these patients (37.8%) compared with 26.3 and 29.9% in groups 1 and 3 respectively. Ischemic renal disease occurred in every tenth patient of group 2 or much more frequently than in groups 1 and 3. This suggests additive COLD and CHD effect on the atherosclerotic process. The combination of these diseases was responsible for a large fraction of patients with chronic renal insufficiency in group 2 (45%). It is concluded that concomitant urogenital pathology in patients with COLD results in mutual aggravation of the clinical course of the two diseases and requires additional examination and obligatory medicamentous correction."

The patients were stratified into quartile groups (Q1 to Q4) defined by baseline corrected creatinine clearance (cCrCl) values of 51.4, 63.8, and 76.8 mg/min/72 kg. The proportions of patients with a discharge diagnosis of AMI increased with declining cCrCl, from 35.5% in Q4 to 46.0% in Q1 (p <0.0001). The frequency of left ventricular (LV) failure (Q4 4.5%, Q1 31.0%, p <0.0001) and cardiac death (Q4 0.5%, Q1 9.5%, p <0.0001) also increased linearly with decreasing cCrCl, with no evidence that the prognostic impact of renal dysfunction was different in AMI or UAP (p for interaction 0.15). Logistic regression analysis confirmed the independent effects of cCrCl on outcome, with odds of LV failure and cardiac death for patients in Q4 being 0.34 (95% confidence intervals 0.16 to 0.72) and 0.14 (95% confidence intervals 0.03 to 0.74), respectively, relative to patients in Q1. No threshold was detected for the adverse effects of renal dysfunction on outcomes; the log odds of LV failure and cardiac death against quartiles of cCrCl both showed significant linear trends (p <0.0001) with each change in quartile, resulting in risk reductions of 55% (odds [SE] 0.45 [0.03]) and 65% (odds [SE]: 0.35 [0.05]), respectively. In conclusion, renal function showed a graded association with LV failure and hospital death that was independent of diagnosis (UAP or AMI) and other baseline variables. There was no detectable threshold of renal dysfunction for these adverse prognostic effects."
CD008691,0,7900665,1,Usefulness of dobutamine stress echocardiography in detecting coronary artery disease in end-stage renal disease.,"The cardiovascular evaluation of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and specificity of currently employed diagnostic tests. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a recently developed technique which is accurate for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in general populations. The purpose of this study was to assess its diagnostic accuracy and prognostic implications in patients with ESRD. Patients with ESRD (n = 97) underwent DSE as part of a preoperative evaluation before being listed for renal transplantation. Patients were followed for 12 +/- 6 months (range 1 to 24) after the study. Rest and dobutamine stress echocardiograms were analyzed for regional and global function. Coronary angiography was performed in 30 patients, and 25 underwent renal transplantation in the follow-up period. DSE had a sensitivity of 95% (92% for 1-vessel, 100% for > or = 2-vessel disease), specificity of 86%, and accuracy of 90% for the detection of CAD. During the follow-up period, 6 patients died; DSE revealed inducible ischemia in 4, and catheterization before death revealed multivessel CAD in 2. Conversely, a normal DSE identified a very low risk population, with a 97% probability of being free of cardiac complications or death during the follow-up period. We conclude that DSE accurately identifies CAD in patients with ESRD and identifies a cohort of patients at low risk for cardiac complications."

CD008691,0,11226084,0,Predicting the risk of death from heart failure after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.,"Heart failure is the most common cause of death among coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients. In addition, most variation in observed mortality rates for CABG surgery is explained by fatal heart failure. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinical risk assessment tool so that clinicians can rapidly and easily assess the risk of fatal heart failure while caring for individual patients. Using prospective data for 8,641 CABG patients, we used logistic regression analysis to predict the risk of fatal heart failure. In multivariate analysis, female sex, prior CABG surgery, ejection fraction <40%, urgent or emergency surgery, advanced age (70-79 yr and >80 yr), peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, dialysis-dependent renal failure and three-vessel coronary disease were significant predictors of fatal postoperative heart failure.

CD008691,0,9857935,0,Biochemical differences between cTnT and cTnI and their significance for diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes.,"Although assays for cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) exhibit similar clinical performance in patients with acute coronary syndromes for diagnosis and risk stratification, there are differences in the release and clearance of these proteins from damaged myocytes. There are also differences in the percentages of patients with chronic renal failure and skeletal muscle myopathies that have abnormal results. A review of the biochemistry of these proteins may provide insights as to the nature of these differences. Cardiac troponin T has a higher overall tissue concentration and free cytoplasmic concentrations than cTnI, and appears in blood of patients with acute myocardial infarction as a mixture of complexed (cTnT-I-C) and free cTnT. Cardiac troponin I is more hydrophobic and appears in blood predominately in the binary complex (I-C) form, with smaller amounts of the ternary (T-I-C) complex. Degradation of the complex will lead to faster clearance of the protein. There are also differences in standardization and availability of commercial troponin kits. Cardiac troponin T assays are available from only one manufacturer and are standardized to a single material, whereas cTnI is available from multiple vendors. While there is some degree of correlation between assays, there are significant proportional biases between results which can be problematical when different tests are made on the same patient."

Recognizing the likely integral role that inflammation plays in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, many hospital laboratories have tests to measure CRP concentration in the clinical setting. However, the clinical use of these tests still need definition. To date, of the plasma-based markers investigated, CRP provides the strongest risk prediction for cardiovascular disease in men and women.

Patients with end-stage renal disease have an annual mortality of 18%. Previous studies have shown that elevated cardiac troponins T and I and hs-CRP predict increased mortality, although these studies have not taken clinical parameters into account. Stable patients with end-stage renal disease (n = 173) were divided into 2 groups: 115 patients with coronary disease equivalent (known coronary or peripheral vascular disease or diabetes mellitus) and 58 patients without it. The 2 groups were then stratified by biomarkers (cardiac troponins T and I and hs-CRP) and followed for 27 months. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Patients with coronary disease equivalent had twofold greater annual mortality than those without (20.4% vs 9.8%, p = 0.003). Among patients with coronary disease equivalent, those with elevated troponins had a further increase in the risk for death relative to patients with normal troponins (25% vs 9% with cardiac troponin I elevation, p <0.001; 24% vs 12% with cardiac troponin T elevation, p = 0.04). hs-CRP did not add to the risk stratification of patients with coronary disease equivalent. Conversely, in patients without coronary disease equivalent, neither troponin further predicted the risk for death. In the small subset of patients without coronary disease equivalent who had hs-CRP >or=3 mg/L, mortality was significantly increased (p = 0.01). In conclusion, initial clinical assessment, followed by the addition of biomarkers, can be used to risk-stratify stable patients with end-stage renal disease."
CD008691,0,15012725,0,Even moderate chronic renal failure is associated with impaired acute and long-term outcome after coronary angioplasty.,"End-stage renal failure requiring maintenance haemodialysis is known to be a strong independent predictor of mortality and complications after coronary interventions. In contrast, data about the outcome of patients with moderate chronic renal failure is very limited and was therefore evaluated in this study in patients with coronary angioplasty (PTCA). This was a retrospective case-control study of 66 patients with moderate chronic renal failure who underwent PTCA, and who were matched to 66 PTCA patients with normal renal function and followed up by telephone interviews. In hospital, patients with renal failure suffered significantly more often from local complications (12.1 vs 0%, P = 0.004) and acute deterioration of renal function after PTCA (7.6 vs 0%, P = 0.023) than their matched controls. Angiographic success after PTCA was not significantly different (85 vs 83%, n.s.) as was the case with in-hospital mortality (6.1 vs 3.0%, n.s.). During follow up (100% complete), 18 patients (27.3%) with renal failure had died compared with seven controls (10.6%; OR 3.2, P = 0.015). Even if deaths from non-cardiac causes in three patients with renal failure were excluded, death after PTCA occurred significantly more often in the renal failure group (P = 0.015, log rang test). Multivariate analyses with stepwise logistic regression identified impaired left ventricular function (OR 2.24, 95%CI 1.33-3.77), elevated serum creatinine (OR 2.02, 95%CI 1.24-3.31) and smaller height (OR 0.91, 95%CI 0.86-0.98) to be independently associated with death. In conclusion, in this matched-pair study, patients with chronic renal failure suffered from more in-hospital complications and from markedly increased long-term mortality after PTCA."

The mechanism through which this mortality risk is mediated is unclear. Data from two national random samples of HD patients (n = 12,833) was used to test the hypothesis that elevated serum PO(4) contributes mainly to cardiac causes of death. During a 2-yr follow-up, the cause-specific relative risk (RR) of death for patients was analyzed separately for several categories of cause of death, including coronary artery disease (CAD), sudden death, and other cardiac causes, cerebrovascular and infection. Cox regression models were fit for each of the eight cause of death categories, adjusting for patient demographics and non-cardiovascular comorbid conditions. Time at risk for each cause-specific model was censored at death that resulted from any of the other causes. Higher mortality risk was seen for patients in the high PO(4) group (>6.5mg/dl) compared with the lower PO(4) group (< or =6.5mg/dl) for death resulting from CAD (RR 1.41; P < 0.0005), sudden death (RR 1.20; P < 0.01), infection (RR 1.20; P < 0.05), and unknown causes (RR 1.25; P < 0.05). Patients in the high PO(4) group also had non-significantly increased RR of death from other cardiac and cerebrovascular causes of death. The RR of sudden death was also strongly associated with elevated Ca x PO(4) product (RR 1.07 per 10 mg(2)/dl(2); P < 0.005) and serum parathyroid hormone levels greater than 495 pg/ml (RR 1.25; P < 0.05).

CD008691,0,15599628,0,Current outcome of elective open repair for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"The outcome of conventional elective open repair for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has improved mainly as a result of screening to detect coronary artery disease, the main risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Our group's policy is to perform routine coronary angiography in patients scheduled to undergo elective AAA repair. The purpose of this study was to evaluate morbidity and mortality in our department using this work-up strategy. From January 1990 to December 2000 we performed elective open repair on 632 patients, including 580 men (92%) and 52 women (8%). Preoperative coronary angiography performed in 607 cases (96%) revealed significant coronary disease in 53% of patients and led to the decision to propose prior myocardial revascularization in 12.5% of cases. Mortality and morbidity in the first 30 days after AAA repair were 1.4% and 15%, respectively. Analysis with the Cox model showed that the only risk factor for mortality was chronic renal insufficiency. Our data support routine use of coronary angiography prior to AAA repair. Screening and, if necessary, treatment of coronary artery disease that is commonly associated with AAA enhances the outcome of open AAA repair."
CD008691,0,7942820,0,"Renal vascular disease causing end-stage renal disease, incidence, clinical correlates, and outcomes: a 20-year clinical experience.","In the United States, the incidence of end-stage renal disease to hypertension has increased sharply over the last 8 years, especially in elderly white dialysis patients who demonstrate very poor survival rates. The 5-year survival rates were near 20% for patients 65 to 74 years old and 9% for those > or = 75 years of age. Our program experienced a sharp increase in cases of end-stage renal disease due to renal vascular disease after 1982. Renal vascular disease was characterized clinically in 83 of 683 dialysis patients either by angiography or asymmetric kidney size in patients with evidence of systemic atherosclerosis, hypertension, insignificant proteinuria, and a benign urinary sediment. The median age was 70 years, with 84% of the patients being older than 61 years. These patients had 56% 2-year, 18% 5-year, and 5% 10-year survival rates, which are quite similar to the 1992 US Renal Data System data. Patients with renal vascular disease have a significantly worse prognosis than other diagnostic groups, most likely due to their older age, underlying vascular disease, and coronary artery disease. We feel that a significant number of elderly white hypertensive patients described in the 1992 US Renal Data Service report have renal vascular disease as a cause of end-stage renal disease, highlighting the need to establish correct renal diagnoses. Hypertension should not be the end-stage renal disease diagnosis in elderly white hypertensive patients if clinical criteria suggest a diagnosis of renal vascular disease."

CD008691,0,9100051,1,Atherosclerotic vascular complications in diabetic transplant candidates.,"Serious vascular complications limit the success of renal transplantation in diabetic patients. Nearly half of diabetic transplant recipients die within 3 years after transplantation from a vascular complication. However, it has been difficult to determine before transplantation which patients are likely to do poorly. Because atherosclerosis is a systemic disease, we hypothesized that diabetic transplant candidates with pretransplant coronary artery disease would be at high risk for vascular complications even if asymptomatic at the time of pretransplant evaluation. Our hypothesis was that insulin-dependent (IDDM) transplant candidates with coronary artery disease identified with pretransplant coronary angiography would have an increased number of vascular events (amputation, cerebral vascular accident [CVA], or myocardial infarction [MI]) within 3 years of follow-up. We prospectively studied 198 consecutive diabetic transplant candidates grouped on the basis of coronary artery disease. Group 1 patients had no stenosis that was 50% or greater, group 2 patients had one or more stenoses between 50% and 74%, and group 3 patients had one or more stenoses of 75% or greater. During median follow-up of 41 months, 64 patients experienced 98 amputations, 28 MIs, and seven CVAs. At 36 months of follow-up, 55% of group 3 patients, 30% of group 2 patients, and 11% of group 1 patients had experienced a vascular event (P < 0.001). Cox regression confirmed the association of coronary artery disease with subsequent vascular events. Patients with coronary artery disease had a sevenfold increased risk of amputation and a fourfold increased risk of myocardial infarction. Six of seven CVAs occurred in patients with coronary artery disease. We conclude that coronary artery disease identified at pretransplant evaluation is associated with an increased risk of noncoronary vascular complications within 3 years after evaluation."

A total of 81 CRF patients were divided into three groups; pre-dialysis (group I, n = 35), hemodialysis (group II, n = 31) and peritoneal dialysis (group III, n = 15). The several serum biochemical markers and calcium score levels by EBCT were determined. The Ca x P products were significantly higher in groups II (p < 0.05) and III (p < 0.01) than in group I. The serum calcium levels were significantly higher in group III than in both group I (p < 0.01) and II (p < 0.05). The serum calcium level in 15 patients with a calcium score > 400 was significantly higher than the 66 patients with a score < or =400 (p < 0.01). The calcium score was significantly higher in the 15 patients with cardiovascular complications than in the 66 patients without cardiovascular complications (628.9+/-904.8 vs. 150.4+/-350.9, p < 0.01).

One hundred forty-four patients with mild renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >1.1 to <2.0 mg/dl) undergoing an elective coronary procedure were randomly assigned to the following 2 groups: standard hydration with sodium chloride plus single-bolus intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate (20 mEq) immediately before contrast exposure (group A, n = 72) and standard hydration alone (group B, n = 72). The primary end point was development of CIN, defined as an increase >25% or >0.5 mg/dl in serum creatinine within 3 days after the procedure. Incidence of the primary end point was lower in group A than in group B (1.4% vs 12.5%, p = 0.017). Incidence of adverse clinical events (acute pulmonary edema, acute renal failure requiring dialysis, and death within 7 days of procedure) did not differ between the 2 groups (0% vs 1.4%).

The most common comorbidities were hypertension (75%), coronary artery disease (50%), diabetes (42.2%), hyperlipidemia (34.9%), and peripheral vascular disease (27.2%), which are all established risk factors for peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Twenty-one percent of subjects were current smokers; 28% were former smokers. Nearly 13.4% of subjects had undergone amputations ranging from single toes to bilateral above knee amputations. Only 31% of subjects had both bilateral palpable pedal pulses present. Neuropathy, as evidenced by the inability to feel the application of monofilaments to 10 sites on each foot or the presence of symptoms, was present in 74.6% of subjects.

CD008691,0,15666478,0,[Specificity of the management of atheromatous disease in diabetic renal failure].,"Atheromatous disease is particularly common and severe in diabetics with renal failure. The prognosis depends on specific therapeutic measures: in this article, the authors will limit the discussion to the management of coronary artery disease. The cardiovascular risk factors must be treated intensively and corrected. The outlook of these patients also depends on the diagnosis of silent ischaemia with a stress test every two years and the prevention of acute renal failure after coronary angiography. Myocardial revascularisation improves the prognosis of high risk coronary patients. The choice of mode of revascularisation depends on the anatomy of the coronary lesions, the surgical risk and the presence of associated valve disease. The results of coronary angioplasty have been improved by the optimisation of anti-thrombotic treatment and the use of active stents. Despite revascularisation, short and medium-term mortality remains much higher than that of non-diabetics with normal renal function. Non-invasive investigations for residual ischaemia are justified 6 months after angioplasty for diagnosing restenosis and, thereafter, every year to detect progression of the atherosclerosis."
CD008691,0,17704043,0,Coronary calcification in patients with end-stage renal disease: a novel endocrine disorder?,"Cardiovascular mortality is significantly increased among patients with end-stage renal disease. The commonly observed vascular calcification in such patients has been considered as one of the causative factors. In patients undergoing dialysis, the incidence of coronary artery calcification is 2-5 times higher compared to patients with normal renal function and angiographically demonstrated coronary artery disease. Moreover, epidemiological studies have revealed a significant correlation of the extent of coronary artery calcification with the severity of underlying atherosclerotic lesions. Vascular calcification was initially considered as a passive process of hydroxyapatite deposition due to elevated plasma concentrations of calcium and phosphate. Nevertheless, there is a growing body of evidence that vascular calcification is an actively regulated and cell-mediated process. This phenomenon includes phenotypic alterations of vascular smooth muscle cells mainly resulting from an imbalance between promoters (such as increased Ca x P product) and inhibitors (fetuin-A, GLA protein, osteoprotegerin) of mineral deposition. With regard to the therapeutic approach, despite the evident effectiveness of both traditional and innovative remedies in the management of metabolic and electrolytic abnormalities of patients with end-stage renal disease, an individualized intervention based on etiopathogenesis is really required."

Analyses were based on data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, a community-based study of risk factors for CHD in middle-aged people. People with known CHD at baseline were excluded from the analysis. Participants were followed for 9 yr for the occurrence of CHD. Anemia was defined as Hgb <13 g/dl in men and <12 g/dl in women. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the relative risk (RR) of CHD occurrence according to Hgb status, after adjusting for other risk factors (demographics, lipids, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, body mass index, and carotid intima-media thickness). A total of 13,329 participants were included. The interaction between Hgb concentration and serum creatinine (Scr) was significant (P = 0.02). Among people with anemia, a Scr >/=1.2 mg/dl in women or >/=1.5 mg/dl in men was associated with a higher risk of CHD (RR, 2.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.42 to 5.28) than those with normal Scr. In contrast, among those without anemia, this association was not noted (RR, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.67). In conclusion, this study indicates that high Scr is associated with almost a threefold risk of CHD among middle-aged people with anemia, whereas no increased risk is found in people with high Scr in the absence of anemia."

CD008691,0,18192951,0,Acute decompensated heart failure: challenges and opportunities.,"Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) represents the most common discharge diagnosis in patients over age 65, and has an exceptionally high mortality and read-mission risk. ADHF is characterized by abnormal hemodynamics, including increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and peripheral vasoconstriction, although cardiac index may be reduced, normal, or increased. Myocardial injury, which may be related to decreased coronary perfusion, activation of neurohormones, and/or renal dysfunction, may contribute to short-term and postdischarge cardiovascular events. Recent ADHF registries have provided valuable insights into the characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes of these patients. Most patients with ADHF present with either normal systolic blood pressure or elevated blood pressures; hypotension is relatively uncommon. These patients have significant cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities that may contribute to the pathogenesis and/or adverse outcomes in ADHF. Therapies for ADHF have been targeted to improve symptoms and hemodynamics, as well as preserve or improve renal function, prevent myocardial damage, modulate neurohumoral and inflammatory activation, and manage other comorbidities that may cause and/or contribute to the progression of this syndrome. Concomitant therapies proven to provide long-term benefits in chronic heart failure are also essential. There remains an unmet need for therapeutic approaches for the early management of ADHF that may improve short- and long-term outcomes. Ongoing clinical trials are intended to provide data that will better define the benefits and risks of therapies for ADHF."

CD008691,0,15541787,0,Heart rate variability in coronary artery disease patients with and without panic disorder.,"Panic disorder (PD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) often co-occur, and CAD patients with comorbid PD suffer greater cardiovascular morbidity and mortality relative to CAD patients without PD. However, the mechanisms underlying these associations are still unknown. Reduced heart rate variability (HRV), a non-invasive measure of cardiac autonomic modulation, is an important predictor of adverse cardiac events. Interestingly, reduced HRV has been observed in patients with panic-like anxiety and PD, as well as in various CAD populations. However, the extent to which HRV is altered in patients with both PD and CAD is unknown. This study evaluated HRV in 42 CAD patients with (n=20) and without (n=22) PD. Patients underwent 48-h electrocardiographic monitoring. Power spectral analysis of HRV indicated that CAD patients with PD exhibited significantly lower LF/HF ratios, which may reflect lower sympathetic modulation, compared with non-PD patients. Additionally, total power in PD patients was made up of a significantly higher proportion of HF power and a significantly lower proportion of VLF power than in non-PD patients. No other significant differences in HRV indices were observed. Results suggest that contrary to what has been observed in the majority of PD-only and CAD-only populations; patients with both PD and CAD appear to exhibit lower sympathetic modulation during ordinary daily life conditions. Though preliminary, these findings suggest that changes in HRV may not be the mechanism underlying greater cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among CAD patients with PD."
CD008691,0,14696151,0,Subclavian artery stenting: factors influencing long-term outcome.,"This study provides extended follow-up of a nonrandomized series of symptomatic patients who underwent subclavian stent-supported angioplasty (SSA) with emphasis on preprocedure factors that may have influenced outcome. The endpoints of mortality and restenosis were analyzed using backward stepwise logistic regression with the following clinical variables: coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal insufficiency/failure, and hypothyroidism. Restenosis is reported based on prospective serial noninvasive studies and/or angiography. Mortality was evaluated by retrospective database review and inquiry to the State Department of Health and Human Services' statistical registry in patients who were lost to follow-up. Over a 9-year period (mean follow-up, 36.1 +/- 30.4 months; maximum observation, 109.5 months), 101 stents were placed in 91 consecutive patients (37 male, 54 female). The mean age at intervention was 62.03 +/- 9.3. The procedure was technically successful in 89 patients 97% (mean pre- and postoperative stenosis and pressure gradients were 90.2% +/- 9.4% vs. 3.7% +/- 6.6%, P < 0.001, and 59.9 +/- 35.2 vs. 0 mm Hg, P < 0.001, respectively), with 13 minor complications and no immediate major complications. One patient died of unrelated causes within 30 days. Per Kaplan-Meier method, for years 1 through 5, the rates of overall patency were 96%, 91%, 86%, 77%, and 72%; likewise, overall patient survival was 93%, 88%, 8%4, 81%, and 76%. No clear predictors for restenosis were discovered, although a trend toward higher recurrence was noted in women (18.5% in female vs. and 8.6% in male; P > 0.05), but the same were less likely to die during follow-up (P > 0.001). Also, the presence of hypothyroidism (P = 0.004) and increasing age (P = 0.068) were positively correlated with all-cause mortality. This study suggests that SSA is predictable, safe, and durable. The diagnosis of symptomatic subclavian disease is of prognostic importance, with age and male gender representing important predictors of all-cause long-term mortality. The strong association of increased mortality with hypothyroidism is difficult to discard and raises the question of a yet to be described thyroid steal phenomena."
CD008691,0,19538490,0,Extent and severity of coronary disease and mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure evaluated for renal transplantation.,"The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD), transplantation status and subsequent mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing evaluation for renal transplantation. Two hundred fifty-three ESRD patients at high risk for CAD underwent coronary angiography as part of a renal transplant evaluation. The cohort was divided into three groups: Group 1 (n = 127) had no vessels with >or=50% stenosis, Group 2 (n = 56) had one vessel with >or=50% stenosis and Group 3 (n = 70) had two or more vessels with >or=50% stenosis. Long-term survival was determined; median follow-up was 3.3 years. The baseline characteristics were similar except for older age and higher proportion of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and peripheral vascular disease in Groups 2 and 3 patients as compared to Group 1. Survival was worse in Group 3 compared to Group 1 (p < 0.0001). Each of the three subgroups had better survival with renal transplantation than those who did not undergo transplantation (p < 0.0001). Although the degree of CAD is related to subsequent mortality, transplantation is associated with better survival regardless of the extent and severity of CAD. Thus, the presence of CAD should not exclude ESRD patients from consideration for this therapy."

The studies were carried out in 9 patients group before and after 3 months of TMZ treatment in doses 3 x 20 mg. Additionally we measured MDA concentration in the blood, as a oxidative stress marker, before and after 2 and 3 months of TMZ treatment. At the start of the study impairment of relaxation as a sign of diastolic dysfunction was detected. This abnormality persisted up to the end of the study. After 3 months of TMZ treatment we observed elevation of ejection fraction from 59.17 +/- 5.99 to 65.33 +/- 8.7% (p = 0.05). Also occurred statistically significant decrease in MDA level after 2 (0.674 +/- 0.029 vs 0.627 +/- 0.034; p < 0.001) and 3 (0.674 +/- 0.029 vs 0.567 +/- 0.063 mumol/L; p = 0.001) months of TMZ treatment.

Invasive investigation may identify those at risk of cardiac death during or after renal transplantation, but which patients should undergo cardiac catheterization is currently not clear. In 95 patients awaiting renal transplantation we assessed the ability of echocardiography and exercise electrocardiography to identify patients at risk of cardiac death. Echocardiography identified impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function in 20%, severe in 8%. Of the patients with severe LV dysfunction, 25% died before transplantation. Of those undergoing exercise electrocardiography, 44% did not achieve 85% of maximum predicted heart rate. No coronary artery disease requiring intervention was identified by exercise testing. These findings indicate that echocardiography, but not exercise electrocardiography, should be part of the assessment for renal transplantation."

CD008691,0,19026294,1,Role of myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing coronary angiography.,"Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at high risk of cardiovascular events. This study examined the prognostic power of stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in 150 patients with ESRD (mean age 53 +/- 9 years; 30% women; 66% with diabetes mellitus) being evaluated for renal transplantation with known coronary anatomy using angiography. Baseline data in addition to perfusion and angiographic parameters were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. All-cause mortality was defined as the outcome measure. An abnormal MPI result was present in 85% of patients, 30% had left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) < or =40%, and 40% had multivessel coronary artery disease using angiography. At a mean follow-up of 3.4 +/- 1.5 years, 53 patients died (35%). LVEF < or =40%, LV dilatation (LV end-diastolic volume >90 ml), and diabetes mellitus were associated with higher mortality (all p <0.05). Both total perfusion defect size and mean number of narrowed coronary arteries using angiography were significantly higher in those who died (p <0.05). In a multivariate model, abnormal MPI results (low LVEF or abnormal perfusion) and diabetes alone were independent predictors of death, whereas number of narrowed arteries using coronary angiography was not. Thus, MPI was a strong predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with ESRD. In conclusion, abnormal MPI results independently predicted worse survival and provided more powerful prognostic data than coronary angiography."
CD008691,0,17378990,0,Emerging role of anemia in heart failure.,"Current medical therapy of heart failure (HF) focuses primarily on blockade of the neurohormonal pathways. This approach appears to have reached a benefit plateau, despite the introduction of new and improved drugs. Therefore, new targets for pharmacologic intervention are now being actively sought, and anemia has emerged as a potential candidate. Anemia is a frequently occurring comorbidity in patients with HF. However, its true prevalence is difficult to determine because no uniform definition of anemia associated with HF currently exists. Therefore, reported prevalence data can vary significantly, ranging from 4% to 55%, depending on the study population and the applied definition of anemia. Data from recent observational studies and clinical trials suggest that a low hemoglobin concentration in patients with HF is associated with, and is an independent risk factor for, increased morbidity and mortality. In light of these findings, anemia is being discussed as a possible new treatment target in patients with HF. So far, however, only a few small studies have explored this possibility using erythropoiesis-stimulating proteins, which for many years have been successfully used in the treatment of anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease or cancer chemotherapy. Preliminary data from these initial HF studies have shown that increased hemoglobin concentrations in patients with anemia were associated with improvements in cardiac and renal function as well as exercise capacity and a reduced need for hospitalizations. Larger, controlled clinical trials are needed to clearly establish the benefits and safety aspects of anemia treatment on morbidity and possibly mortality in HF patients."

This study evaluated the accuracy of digital subtraction fluorography in detecting coronary calcification as a noninvasive, nonexercise screening test for coronary artery disease. Eighty-six patients under evaluation for renal transplantation and considered at increased risk of coronary artery disease were studied by coronary arteriography and digital subtraction fluorography for coronary calcification. Significant coronary disease (greater than or equal to 50% obstruction in at least one vessel) was present in 36 (42%) patients. The detection of coronary calcification by digital subtraction fluorography had a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 66%. The probability of disease being present in the absence of coronary calcification in this group was 18%. The detection of coronary calcification by digital subtraction fluorography appears to be a satisfactory and inexpensive screening test in this setting."

The initial hemoglobin concentration of 7.9 +/- 0.7 g/dl, (mean +/- S.D.) rose to 10.4 +/- 1.1 g/dl, (p < 0.01) after three months of rHuEPO therapy. The partial correction of renal anemia resulted in a significant increase in exercise duration (from 278 +/- 84 sec to 384 +/- 74 sec, p < 0.01) and maximum pressure-rate product (from 228.3 +/- 50.3 mmHg.bpm/10(2) to 262.8 +/- 40.4 mmHg.bpm/10(2), p < 0.01). The maximum exercise-induced ST segment depression significantly decreased after treatment (from 1.3 +/- 0.5 mm to 0.5 +/- 0.5 mm, p < 0.05).

Her condition deteriorated and organic pneumonia of the right middle lobe progressed. She recovered after 6 months and coronary arteriography was performed. A 90% stenosis was detected at the ostium of the right coronary artery. An aberrant tortuous artery arose from the distal sinus node artery, and drained into the lung network, but also partially drained to the right segmental pulmonary artery branch. The diagnosis was significant stenosis of the right coronary artery, and pulmonary pseudosequestration or pulmonary sequestration receiving arterial supply from the sinus node artery. Surgical revascularization, ligation of the aberrant artery, and partial resection of the right middle lobe were performed.

However, their value in patients with renal failure has been questioned. In this study, we determined cTnT and cTnI at 3-month intervals during 9 months in 97 chronic renal failure (CRF) patients treated with hemodialysis. cTnT was measured using a third generation immunoassay and cTnI by fluorimetric immunoassay with a detection limit similar to that of cTnT (0.01 microg/l). In the renal patients without coronary heart disease (CHD(-) group), cTnT was more frequently elevated above cut-off for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (up to 21.6%) than cTnI (no patient). In the absence of CHD, cTnT levels were positively correlated to age, and more than half of the CHD(-) patients aged over 60 years had cTnT levels above the upper reference limit (URL) of 0.04 microg/l (0.059+/-0.042 microg/l). cTnI increased with age in parallel to cTnT but mean levels did not exceed the URL of 0.08 microg/l in the CHD(-) patients aged over 60 years (0.036+/-0.031 microg/l). In the patients with documented cardiac events (CHD(+)) we found higher troponin levels than in the CHD(-) patients of the corresponding age, but for cTnl the differences between CHD(+) and CHD(-) patients were significant in the patients aged < or =60 years only (0.049+/-0.054 vs. 0.019+/-0.018 microg/l, p<0.05). For cTnT, the differences between patients with and without coronary events also tended to be less important in the eldest patients. There was a significant correlation between cTnI and cTnT levels in the CHD(-) and in the CHD(+) groups. Changes in the plasma levels of cardiac troponins are common in hemodialysis patients in the absence of CHD, and advanced age appears to amplify these changes. The reason could be that most hemodialysis patients with advanced age have subclinical lesions and demonstrate release characteristics of troponins that compare to those in patients with symptomatic coronary events. Therefore, it will be important to analyze troponin elevations above the URL or above the cut-off concentration for AMI in asymptomatic renal patients in relation to prognosis."

CD008691,0,18312161,0,Pharmacological control of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic hemodialysis patients: cinacalcet is coming to Japan.,"Secondary hyperparathyroidism has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality due to skeletal and extraskeletal manifestations. Cinacalcet, a newly developed calcimimetic, is reported to decrease parathyroidism, as well as serum levels of phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca) and therefore Ca x P product. Available evidence has shown that cinacalcet decreases the rate of parathyroidectomy and bone fracture in hemodialysis patients, but the death rate remains the same. Although, it is not yet available in Japan, cinacalcet is expected to be available as a possible drug for patients undergoing hemodialysis due to secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with refractory hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia. Except for the high cost, cinacalcet will be a welcome therapeutic option for end-stage renal disease and probably also for pre-end-stage renal disease patients. Dietary phosphate restriction and adequate hemodialysis, however, are still the main strategy for the control of hyperphosphatemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism."
CD008691,0,15807181,0,Silent myocardial ischemia and high-grade ventricular arrhythmias in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.,"The occurrence of silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) and serious arrhythmias during hemodialysis (HD) has been well documented. However, it is unclear whether these changes are due to epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD). We conducted a prospective study to assess whether SMI and arrhythmias during HD correlated with angiographically demonstrable CAD. Twenty-three patients with end-stage renal disease on maintenance HD underwent 48-hour Holter monitoring, beginning 24 hours prior to a HD session. All patients underwent biochemical evaluation, coronary angiography, and echocardiography. Holter monitoring showed SMI during HD in 22% cases. A significant increase in the frequency of ventricular ectopics (VEs) was noted during and after HD. Patients who showed SMI during HD and VEs prior to initiation of dialysis were more likely to develop significant ventricular arrhythmias during and after HD. Epicardial CAD was documented in four patients, and it did not correlate with SMI. To conclude, HD is an arrhythmogenic process. SMI during dialysis is probably not due to epicardial CAD but predisposes to clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias during and after HD. The cause of SMI during HD in patients without demonstrable CAD needs further investigation."

Thirty-eight of 65 patients (59%) who had valve calcium died at 3.5-year follow-up versus 21 of 72 patients (29%) who did not have valve calcium and who died at 4.3-year follow-up (p = 0.0005)."

Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) provides a reproducible, high-resolution imaging of calcium contained in cardiac arteries, measured by Agatston score.

CD008691,0,11567589,0,The effect of kidney transplant on cardiac function: an echocardiographic perspective.,"Kidney transplant (KT) resolves many of the cardiac abnormalities associated with chronic kidney failure (CKF). This study analyzed cardiac alterations of kidney failure and their modification with transplant. Thirteen patients in CKF underwent conventional echocardiograms, dobutamine stress echocardiograms, and injection of contrast to examine perfusion before KT and 3 months after transplant. Nine patients had evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and six had evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Wall thickness, left ventricular mass, and mass index diminished after KT; only two patients continued to manifest hypertrophy. Left ventricular systolic diameters and volumes diminished at 3 months, and diastolic diameters after 4 months. Left ventricular fractional shortening and ejection fraction increased 3 months after transplant. At the end of the study, only two patients continued to show diastolic dysfunction. Dobutamine echocardiograms showed no segmental wall-movement abnormalities. Myocardial perfusion was normal before and after transplant. The results suggest that KT diminishes hypertrophy and improves left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. Echocardiography provides valuable information for detection and follow-up of cardiac abnormalities in patients with kidney disease. Evaluation of segmental wall movement and myocardial perfusion aid in demonstrating that our studied patients with CKF had no indirect signs of coronary artery disease."

CD008691,0,8979003,0,Screening for cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients.,"The burden of cardiac disease in dialysis patients is high, resulting from cardiomyopathy and from coronary artery disease. Asymptomatic dialysis patients, patients with heart failure, patients with symptomatic ischaemic heart disease, and patients being evaluated for renal transplantation all require investigation to determine the presence or the extent of heart disease. Echocardiography is very useful for screening for cardiomyopathy, but should be undertaken when patients are euvolaemic. Non-invasive tests for coronary artery disease, particularly exercise-based tests, are less sensitive and less specific in dialysis patients than in the general population. Dobutamine stress echocardiography may be more sensitive in patients with renal failure than other investigations. Patients with abnormal screening tests or symptomatic ischaemic heart disease should undergo coronary angiography and subsequent revascularization procedures if indicated."
CD008691,0,3987103,0,Left ventricular function in uremia: echocardiographic and radionuclide assessment in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.,"Echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography were performed in 37 uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis with no apparent coronary artery disease, pericardial effusion, valvular heart disease or heart failure. These non-invasive studies were performed during the interdialytic period (about 18 hours after a dialysis). Sixty-two percent of our patients had abnormal left ventricular function with one or more abnormal echocardiographic parameters. The significant abnormalities were enlargement of the left ventricular cavity, a reduction of myocardial contractility, and thickening of the left ventricular posterior wall. Similar findings were found in 10 undialyzed uremic patients. Measurement of cardiac index and ejection fraction were found to be inadequate for a full assessment of left ventricular function and other parameters such as the mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and mean normalized posterior wall velocity should be included. There is a significant number of hemodialysis patients (7/37) with congestive cardiomyopathic features on the echocardiogram. Their clinical features are no different from the other patients in this study, except they have a significantly higher prevalence of uremic hyperparathyroidism. Our findings support that the existence of a specific uremic cardiomyopathy and uremic hyperparathyroidism may play an important role in the pathogenesis."
CD008691,0,360837,1,Natural history of asymptomatic coronary arteriographic lesions in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease.,"Arteriosclerotic heart disease is a major cause of death in insulin-requiring juvenile diabetic patients treated for end-stage renal disease. Eleven consecutive diabetic patients without clinical evidence of coronary artery disease underwent complete cardiac evaluations, including coronary arteriography, as part of transplant recipient work-ups. Seven were women and four were men; their mean age was 32 (21 to 50 years). Angiographically, every patient had multifocal atherosclerotic coronary disease. Four of seven patients tested had positive-stress electrocardiograms. In this group of patients followed for a mean of 19.8 months, eight died. Of these deaths, six were due to coronary heart disease and another due to a stroke. In two patients who became clinically symptomatic, serial angiograms revealed progressive disease of the coronary circulation; in one case, despite normal renal allograft function and serum lipid levels. The mode of end-stage renal disease treatment, serum lipids or blood pressure control could not be linked to mortality. It is concluded that arteriosclerotic heart disease is common in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease even when angina is absent. The natural history in this high risk population is an important consideration in the selection of patients for end-stage renal disease treatment."
CD008691,0,18271835,0,Poor correlation between coronary artery calcification and obstructive coronary artery disease in an end-stage renal disease patient.,"Vascular calcification is highly prevalent and often severe in patients with chronic kidney disease. Arterial calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease can result from the deposition of mineral along the intimal layer of arteries in conjunction with atheromatous plaques or from calcium deposition in the medial wall of arteries, also known as Monckeberg's sclerosis. Whether coronary artery calcium scores as measured by electron beam computed tomography correlate with occlusive atherosclerotic disease in the dialysis population is uncertain. Here we report a case of an asymptomatic patient with diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, who was found to have extremely elevated coronary artery calcium scores on electron beam computed tomography, but varied degrees of atherosclerotic plaque in her coronary arteries on coronary angiography. This suggests that in addition to the calcification anticipated in a remodeled intima, a proportion of the calcification is also likely to be in the arterial media. Thus, this case demonstrates that even an extremely high coronary calcium score may not be a satisfactory surrogate marker for obstructive atherosclerosis in elderly diabetic dialysis patients."

CD008691,0,20233537,0,Impact of long-acting calcium channel blockers on the prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease with and without chronic kidney disease: a comparison of three drugs.,"Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) can prevent cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This study looked retrospectively at the prognosis of CAD in hypertensive patients with CAD who had undergone a coronary angiograph, had been given a CCB (benidipine [n = 66], amlodipine [n = 45], or long-acting nifedipine [n = 31]) on hospital discharge and were then followed up for a mean +/- SD of 5.2 +/- 2.9 years. Systolic/diastolic blood pressure for all 142 patients decreased significantly from a mean +/- SD of 137 +/- 20/74 +/- 15 mmHg to 129 +/- 20/71 +/- 12 mmHg. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) occurred in 15 patients. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was a significant risk factor for MACE (hazard ratio 2.35, 95% confidence intervals 1.45, 3.80). Benidipine was superior to nifedipine in preventing MACE in patients both with and without CKD. In conclusion, benidipine and amlodipine reduced the frequency of MACE in hypertensive patients with CAD, particularly in those with complicating CKD."

CD008691,0,2816731,1,Noninvasive cardiac risk stratification of diabetic and nondiabetic uremic renal allograft candidates using dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging and radionuclide ventriculography.,"The ability of noninvasive risk stratification using dipyridamole-thallium-201 (Tl-201) imaging and radionuclide ventriculography to predict perioperative and long-term cardiac events (myocardial infarction or cardiac death) was evaluated in 36 uremic diabetic and 29 nondiabetic candidates for renal allograft surgery. Of the 35 patients who underwent renal allograft surgery 8 +/- 7 months after the study, none had transient Tl-201 defects (although 13 had depressed left ventricular ejection fraction) and none developed perioperative cardiac events. During a mean follow-up of 23 +/- 11 months, 6 (9%) patients developed cardiac events. Logistic regression analysis was used to compare the predictive value of clinical data (including age, sex, diabetes, chest pain history, allograft recipient) and radionuclide data. Presence of transient Tl-201 defect and left ventricular ejection fraction were the only significant predictors of future cardiac events (p less than 0.01). No other patient variables, including diabetes or receiving a renal allograft, had either univariate or multivariate predictive value. All 3 patients with transient Tl-201 defects had cardiac events compared with only 3 of 62 (5%) patients without transient Tl-201 defect (p less than 0.0001). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was lower in patients with cardiac events (44 +/- 13%) compared with patients without cardiac events (57 +/- 9%, p less than 0.005). Overall, 5 of 6 patients with cardiac events had either transient Tl-201 defects or depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Dipyridamole-Tl-201 imaging and radionuclide ventriculography may be helpful in identifying uremic candidates for renal allograft surgery who are at low risk for perioperative and long-term cardiac events."
CD008691,0,15956072,0,Close association of Chlamydia pneumoniae IgA seropositivity by ELISA with the presence of coronary artery stenosis in haemodialysis patients.,Traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease do not fully explain the accelerated atherosclerosis present in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The goal of this study was to identify the association of clinical and laboratory factors including seropositivity for Chlamydia pneumoniae determined by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the presence of coronary artery disease identified by coronary angiography in ESRD patients.
CD008691,0,19090253,0,Comparison of plasma cardiac Troponin I and cardiac enzymes in haemodialysis patients of Gorgan (south east of Iran).,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of haemodialysis on plasma Cardiac Troponin I and cardiac enzymes before and after the dialysis process. Twenty two patients with Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) disease who were haemodialyzed at 5th Azar hospital of Gorgan Dialysis Center were recruited for this study (2005). The patients do not have coronary heart disease. Plasma cardiac enzymes showed no significant difference in the post dialysis group when compared with predialysis. Plasma levels of Cardiac Troponin I in 12 haemodialyzed patients were significantly increased in the postdialysis group when compared with predialysis, whereas plasma level of Cardiac Troponin I in 10 haemodialyzed patients were undetectable (less than 0.1 microg L(-1)). The observation of meaningful increasing level of plasma Cardiac Troponin I in the haemodialyzed patients after the process of dialysis shows that Cardiac Troponin I is highly specific marker for Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) when compared with other cardiac enzymes and is particularly useful for detecting AMI in chronic renal failure and haemodialysis patients which can prevent sudden cardiovascular abnormality and sudden silent myocardial infarction in these patients."
CD008691,0,17533028,0,Rupture of an infected liver cyst into the pericardium in a kidney transplant recipient with polycystic kidney disease.,"Polycystic liver disease is the most common extrarenal manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Hepatic cysts often are multiple, and in renal transplant recipients, occult infection with or without concurrent kidney cyst infection is a frequent cause of abdominal pain and fever and may require long-term antibiotic use and hospitalization. Rupture and bleeding of hepatic cysts into the peritoneum or viscera are infrequent complications that have been reported. Identification of a single culprit lesion that could be targeted for surgical intervention often is difficult because such imaging studies as computed tomographic scans, magnetic resonance images, or radionuclide-tagged white cell scans often show several inflamed cysts that can persist over several subsequent scans. Treatment may require surgical intervention. Eradication of infection and wound healing also is made difficult by concomitant immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients. We present the case of a renal transplant recipient with an infected dominant polycystic liver cyst that ruptured into the pericardium, leading to tamponade."
CD008691,0,15942180,0,"Diabetic nephropathy, percutaneous coronary interventions, and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.","Since recent studies demonstrated an impaired outcome after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in patients with chronic renal failure but did not address the aetiology of renal failure, we now analysed the outcome of patients with diabetic nephropathy in 721 consecutive patients undergoing PCI. Diabetic nephropathy was present in 37 patients (5.1%), and diabetes alone in 126 patients (17.5%); 178 patients (24.7%) suffered from renal insufficiency of other causes; the other 380 patients (52.7%) were used as controls. Although angiographic success rates were similar in the subgroups (94-97%), 30-day and long-term mortality after 4 years was significantly higher in patients with diabetic nephropathy (8.1 and 27%, respectively) than in diabetics (1.6 and 8.7%, respectively), patients with renal insufficiency (3.9 and 16.8%, respectively), or controls (2.4 and 5.0%, respectively, each p<0.001, log-rank test). Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers was associated with a marked decrease in 2-year mortality in patients with diabetic nephropathy (19.4 vs. 33.3%, respectively, p=0.02, log-rank test)."
CD008691,0,11788408,0,Inhibition of ERK attenuates force development by lowering myosin light chain phosphorylation.,"Phosphorylation of the actin-associated protein caldesmon (CaD) by extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) is purported to participate in force maintenance by vascular smooth muscle. We examined the interrelationship among ERK1/2 activity, phosphorylation of the high molecular weight isoform of CaD (h-CaD) and the 20-kDa myosin light chain (LC(20)), and isometric force in strips of porcine carotid artery stimulated with endothelin-1 (ET-1; 50 nM). After an initial delay, ERK1/2 activity increased in parallel with ET-1-mediated force; h-CaD phosphorylation increased modestly. 2-(2'-Amino-3'-methoxyphenyl)-ox-anaphthalen-4-one (PD-098059; 50 microM), an ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor, significantly reduced basal ERK1/2 activity within 1 h, but only partially attenuated h-CaD phosphorylation at 3 h. The mechanisms underlying the temporal dissociation of ERK1/2 activity from h-CaD phosphorylation are unknown, but include the possibility that a kinase other than ERK1/2 phosphorylates h-CaD or, more likely, that phosphate turnover in h-CaD is very slow. PD-098059 partially inhibited the development of ET-1-stimulated force only in Ca(2+)-replete physiological saline solution, primarily by reducing LC(20) phosphorylation, yet had no effect on myosin light chain kinase in vitro. These inhibitory effects were most evident during the early phase of force production. The inhibitory effect of PD-098059 on force could not be correlated with a corresponding effect on ERK1/2-mediated h-CaD phosphorylation because force in arterial strips stimulated with ET-1 in the absence or presence of PD-098059 tended to approximate each other over time despite significant differences in the level of h-CaD phosphorylation. Force and LC(20) phosphorylation in response to KCl depolarization were unaffected by PD-098059. These results show that ERK1/2 may regulate force in arterial smooth muscle, but suggest that the mechanism for this effect is by inhibiting LC(20) phosphorylation."
CD008691,0,1833574,0,[The clinical significance of reverse redistribution of Tl-201 SPECT at rest in the 1st month after the onset of acute myocardial infarction].,"The pattern of Thallium-201 reverse redistribution (r-RD) at rest has been reported in some patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the acute phase. But there is no report of this pattern in the later phase. To investigate the significance of Thallium-201 reverse redistribution in the subacute phase, 37 patients with AMI underwent Thallium-201 SPECT at rest a month after the onset. The patients were classified into three groups visually and 19 of 37 patients (51%) showed the persistent defect pattern (Group PD), and the remaining 18 patients (49%) had the reverse redistribution pattern (Group r-RD). None of them had the redistribution pattern. Coronary reflow was earlier and the incidence of the scintigraphic overlap on Dual SPECT image of 99mTc-PYP/201TlCl in the acute phase was more frequent in Group r-RD than in Group PD. A decrease in thallium defect size of patients with r-RD from the acute phase to one month after the onset represented improvement more significantly than that with PD. Initial %Tl uptake of the infarcted region of Group r-RD was greater than that of Group PD. The degree of stenosis of the infarct-related coronary artery in Group r-RD was less severe than that in Group PD. And corresponding regional wall motion of Group r-RD was less impaired. The Thallium-201 washout in the infarcted region with r-RD was significantly faster than that in the normal region. It is concluded that the r-RD pattern at rest in the 1st month after the onset of AMI may be a sign of viable myocardium."
CD008691,0,17658266,0,Predictors of mortality after aortic valve replacement.,"Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is recommended as a standard surgical procedure for aortic valve disease. Still the evidence for commonly claimed predictors of post-AVR prognosis, in particular mortality, appears scant. This systematic review reports on the evidence for predictors of post-AVR mortality, and may be helpful in pre-surgical risk-stratification. In PubMed, we searched for original reports of post-AVR follow-up studies. We assessed the quality of study design and methods with a standardized checklist. Data of the reported predictors of mortality and outcomes were extracted. Twenty-eight studies met our inclusion criteria. Sixteen studies were considered of high quality. There is strong evidence that the risk of early mortality is increased by emergency surgery, while the risk of late mortality is increased with older age and preoperative atrial fibrillation. There is moderate evidence that the risk of early mortality is increased by older age, aortic insufficiency, coronary artery disease, longer cardiopulmonary bypass time, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF), infective endocarditis, hypertension, mechanical valves, preoperative pacing, dialysis-dependent renal failure and valve size; and that the risk for late mortality is increased by emergency surgery and urgency of the operation. There is little evidence for high New York Heart Association class, concomitant coronary artery bypass graft and many other commonly claimed risk factors for post-AVR mortality. The reported evidence on predictors of post-AVR mortality will help for pre-surgical risk-stratification, i.e. to discern patients at high or low risk for early and late post-AVR mortality. Future prognostic studies should take the evidence from this review into account and should focus on derivation of a predictive model for post-AVR survival."
CD008691,0,8788732,0,Coronary restenosis.,"Return of angina within 6 months of a catheter-based treatment of coronary artery disease usually reflects restenosis due to an overly aggressive local healing response to the procedure-related arterial injury. The restenotic lesion should be treated aggressively. Patients with preexisting diabetes mellitus, renal failure requiring hemodialysis, and left anterior descending artery lesions should be considered to be at exceedingly high risk for clinically significant restenosis. Exercise testing is indicated for all patients who experience a return of their angina within 6 months of an interventional procedure. Nurse practitioners in the primary care setting may be the first clinicians to hear of the return of angina. Patients should always be reassured that repeat intervention is almost always possible and is generally effective in providing long-term relief. New devices (in particular the Palmaz-Schatz stent) may help reduce the likelihood of restenosis, to the extent that they provide a large acute post-treatment lumen diameter that is more tolerant of intimal hyperplasia without producing significant narrowing. Until adjunctive drug therapy is found that effectively reduces the local tissue response to interventional therapy, all clinicians involved in caring for patients following such procedures will need to be vigilant and knowledgeable about recognizing and treating restenosis."
CD008691,0,11318751,0,Immediate and long-term results of coronary artery bypass operation in hemodialysis patients.,"This study evaluated the early and late results of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients on long-term maintenance hemodialysis (chronic HD) at Teikyo University Ichihara Hospital between January 1996 and June 2000. Thirty-six patients on chronic HD underwent CABG. There were 26 males (72%) and 10 females (28%) ranging from 41 to 81 years (mean +/- SD, 61.8 +/- 9.2 years) of age. Twenty-one patients (58%) had unstable angina, 14 (39%) stable angina, and 1 acute myocardial infarction. Eleven patients (31%) had urgent or emergency CABG. The average graft number was 2.5 +/- 0.8 (arterial graft 1.3 +/- 0.7/patient). Six patients had concomitant cardiac operations. Three patients underwent re- or a second re-CABG. Five patients underwent off-pump CABG. Principally, HD was performed during cardiopulmonary bypass and was followed by continuous hemodiafiltration in the early postoperative period. The early mortality was 11%; 25% in emergency and urgent CABG and 4% in elective CABG. In the follow-up period between 1 and 53 months (mean +/- SD 21.9 +/- 15.1 months), 4 patients died, and 9 patients developed recurrence of angina pectoris (6, occlusion of saphenous vein graft and 3, native coronary progression). Six patients had coronary intervention. The postoperative angiogram showed that all arterial grafts were patent, but the patency of the vein grafts was only 61.5%. The early results of CABG in patients on chronic HD was satisfactory. The late recurrence of angina pectoris mostly was caused by occlusion of the saphenous vein graft. In conclusion, the aggressive use of arterial grafts is crucial in CABG for patients on chronic HD."
CD008691,0,11318755,0,Coronary artery bypass grafting in 105 patients with hemodialysis-dependent renal failure.,"This study was proposed to define early and long-term results of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in dialysis-dependent renal failure (RF) patients, and preoperative patient characteristics. This study included 105 patients (87 males and 18 females; mean age 60.0 +/- 9.0 years, range 39-79) with RF on maintenance dialysis (hemodialysis 100, peritoneal dialysis 5) who underwent isolated CABG between August 1985 and April 2000. Postoperative follow-up was completed in 100% and averaged 3.1 years. There were 22 emergency and 2 re-CABG cases. Previous myocardial infarction (MI) was found in 55 patients (52%), and unstable angina was noted in 53 patients (50%). Diabetes mellitus was the cause of RF in 50 patients (48%; 24 patients required insulin). There was 1 case of single vessel disease, 31 cases of double vessel disease, 54 cases of triple vessel disease, and 19 cases of left main disease. Preoperative left ventriculography was performed in 92 patients (88%). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 48.3 +/- 15.8% (range 11-74%) and was 40% or less in 25 patients (27%). The mean number of distal anastomoses was 2.5 (range 1-5). Three patients received only vein grafts, but all were cases of emergency CABG. The remaining 102 patients (97%) received at least 1 arterial conduit. Among them, 64 patients received only arterial conduits, and 72 patients received 2 or more distal anastomoses with arterial conduits. Five patients (4.8%) died within 30 days after CABG (2 cardiac deaths and 3 noncardiac deaths), and 8 patients (7.6%) died beyond 30 days after CABG before discharge (all noncardiac deaths). The cause of 2 cardiac deaths was abrupt circulatory collapse during or after hemodialysis in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF; 11% and 28%) in the early postoperative period. The causes of 8 noncardiac deaths included infection in 4 and rupture of aortic aneurysm, stroke, sleep apnea syndrome, and mesenteric infarction. During the follow-up period, there were 29 late deaths (8 cardiac, 13 noncardiac, and 8 sudden death), 6 MIs, 13 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and 1 re-CABG. The 5-year actuarial survival rate was 59.8%, the cardiac death-free rate was 83.0%, and the cardiac event-free rate was 62.4%. Although CABG in patients on hemodialysis is associated with high early and long-term mortality in terms of both cardiac and noncardiac deaths in proportion to the severity of the preoperative condition, long-term survival was still better than that of general dialysis patients. Meticulous perioperative management may be the key factor in the improvement of early results."

The objective of this study was to determine the natural history and risk factors associated with CAC progression in a cohort of incident asymptomatic renal transplant recipients with no history of coronary revascularization. Electron-beam computed tomography was performed in 82 subjects at time of transplantation and at least 1 year later. Mean (SD) and median CAC score increased for all subjects from 392.4 (747.9) and 75.8 at time of transplant to 475.3 (873.5), (p = 0.002[log]) and 98.9 (p < 0.001), respectively. Most subjects (89%) with no calcifications remained without calcification. Mean annualized rate (SD) of CAC score change was 52.5 (150) with a median of 0.5. Average yearly percent change was 67.3 (409.6) with a median of 1.4. In multivariate analysis, diastolic blood pressure at 3 months post-transplant, Caucasian race, glomerular filtration rate at 3.0, months post-transplant, body mass index and baseline CAC score were independent predictors of annualized rate of CAC change. There is significant progression of CAC post-renal transplantation in most subjects. Progression is most likely to occur in white patients and is associated with clinical factors such as blood pressure, body mass index, renal function and baseline CAC score."
CD008691,0,19563485,1,Assessment of cardiovascular risk in waiting-listed renal transplant patients: a single center experience in 558 cases.,"Cardiac screening is recommended to prevent cardiovascular death after renal transplantation. This retrospective observational study illustrates the results of application of a cardiac assessment algorithm in a series of 558 renal transplant candidates at a single center in Turin, Italy. A dipyridamole-stress sestamibi myocardial scintiscan (DMS) performed in 302/558 (54.1%) cases was positive in 52 (17.2%), negative in 200 (66.2%), borderline in 16 (5.3%), and with signs of previous necrosis in 34 (11.4%). Coronary lesions detected by angiography in 48.1% of the 52 positives were treated medically (13.5%) or by percutaneous/surgical procedure (34.6%). Coronary lesions were detected in 14.1% of asymptomatic population subgroup. The minor and major cardiovascular event rates and the cardiovascular death rate were 1.9%, 0%, and 0%, respectively, in positive DMS group (high-cardiological risk) vs. 10%, 4.5%, and 3.5% in the negatives (p > 0.5; n.s.). It is suggested that not increased cardiovascular event or deaths rates in the high-risk group reflect early coronary lesion detection and correction. Since 55.9% of cardiovascular events or deaths occurred in the negative group more than 24 months after the DMS, its mandatory repetition every two yr after a negative finding is recommended."

CD008691,0,7282731,0,Disabling angina pectoris with normal coronary arteries in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis.,"Reports of patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis presenting with angina pectoris have usually shown severe coronary atherosclerosis. We studied a series of nine patients undergoing regular maintenance dialysis referred for incapacitating angina. Of them, four had strictly normal coronary angiograms. The patients with normal angiograms were all females who were significantly younger (p less than 0.05) and had more severe hypertension and higher left ventricular wall stress than patients showing coronary artery lesions. Anemia and increased myocardial oxygen consumption due to high blood pressure may explain the syndrome of angina pectoris in the presence of long-term dialysis in patients with normal coronary arteries. The prevalence of this association cannot be ascertained unless prospective studies are conducted. However, our data suggest that it might not be an uncommon finding."

CD008691,0,19760091,0,Tc-99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography for guiding percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with multivessel disease: a comparison with quantitative coronary angiography and fractional flow reserve.,"To evaluate the accuracy of myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPI) in the detection and allocation of vessel specific perfusion defects (PD) using standard distribution territories in a routine clinical procedure of patients with multivessel disease (MVD). Combined quantitative coronary angiography and fractional flow reserve (QCA/FFR) measurements were used as invasive reference standard. 216 vessels in 72 MVD patients (67 +/- 10 years, 28 female) were investigated using MPI and QCA. FFR of 93 vessels with intermediate stenoses was determined. MPI detected significant stenoses according to QCA/FFR findings with a sensitivity of 85%. However, vessel-based evaluation using standard myocardial distribution territories delivered a sensitivity of only 62% (28 MPI+ out of 45 (QCA/FFR)+ findings), with specificity, PPV and NPV of 90, 62 and 90%. 7/17 false positive and 7/17 false negative findings (41%) could be attributed to incorrect allocation of reversible PD to their respective coronary arteries. 6/17 (35%) perfusion territories were classified as false negative when additional fixed PD were present. MPI had reasonable sensitivity for the detection of significant coronary artery disease in patients with multivessel disease. However, sensitivity decreased markedly, when the significance of each individual stenosis was evaluated using standard myocardial supplying territories. In this setting, 41% of false negative and false positive MPI findings resulted from incorrect allocation of reversible perfusion defects to their determining supplying vessel."
CD008691,0,16350834,0,Fabry disease--a diagnostic and therapeutic problem.,"The authors present a patient with Fabry syndrome that remained undiagnosed for several years. Fabry syndrome is a genetic disease related to changes on the X chromosome. Its complex clinical presentation and diverse symptomatology is caused by deficient activity of lysosomal hydrolase alpha-galactosidase enzyme. Defect in the basic alpha-galactosidase molecule implies genetic change, which can be a predisposing factor for the development of atypical and typical forms of this genetic disease. In the presented case, clinical manifestation and hemizygous symptomatology were the evidence of metabolic and genetic irregularity, typical clinical presentation of Fabry disease. Many authors report generalized vasculopathy as a basic characteristic of Fabry disease and a causative factor of multiorgan changes. Some authors indicate that persons with diagnosed asymmetric hypertrophy of the left ventricle have decreased alpha-galactosidase. Cardiac complications, coronary disease, and acute myocardial ischemia are often present in cases of Fabry disease, frequently causing death in such patients. Characteristic central nervous system symptoms with skin-burning sensation and paresthesia were also present in our case. Cerebrovascular complications were caused by changes on small blood vessels. Clinical signs of renal failure were nonspecific, and the diagnosis was based on extrarenal symptoms. Initial renal manifestations were insignificant as asymptomatic proteinuria and microhematuria, due to which our patient was referred to further examination. The level of alpha-galactosidase was significantly decreased. The severity and progression of this disease depends on the level of alpha-galactosidase enzyme in serum and its catabolic effect. More recent studies have showed that deficient enzyme can be synthetic zed and, accordingly our patient has been successfully enrolled in the replacement therapy program."
CD008691,0,14750097,1,Coronary artery calcification measured with electron-beam computerized tomography correlates poorly with coronary artery angiography in dialysis patients.,"Coronary artery calcification measured by electron-beam computerized tomography (EBCT) correlates with plaque burden and vessel stenosis and is predictive of future cardiac events in the general population. Uremic vascular calcification is common and widespread, tends to be medial as well as intimal, and may not relate solely to atherosclerotic lesions. Despite this difference and in the absence of any direct evidence in uremic patients, it is generally implied that coronary artery calcification equates to occlusive atherosclerosis."
CD008691,0,11232976,0,Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm in a renal transplant patient.,"A 65-year-old man presented with an asymptomatic infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm of 6 cm in transverse diameter. Five years before he received a cadaveric renal transplant. The patient also had the following risk factors and associated diseases: arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty and stent, ileal resection secondary to Chron disease, hepatopathy, hyperlipidemia and hepato-renal cystic disease. The ASA classification was III, IV. Considering previous abdominal operations and risk factors, we decided to repair the aneurysm with a minimal aggression. The aneurysm was successfully approached by an endovascular route implanting a 22x10 bifurcated aorto-iliac endovascular prosthesis. The patient died 13 months later after being diagnosed of enterocolitis by cytomegalovirus complicated with sepsis and lung infection. We consider this less invasive modality of treatment a valid and useful alternative in this high-risk group of patients."

CD008691,0,18510627,1,Prognostic value of cardiovascular screening in potential renal transplant recipients: a single-center prospective observational study.,"We assessed the outcome of pretransplant cardiac assessment in a single center. Three hundred patients with end-stage renal disease underwent electrocardiogram, Bruce exercise testing (ETT) and ventricular assessment by cardiac MRI. Patients with high index of suspicion of coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if indicated. Two hundred and twenty-two patients were accepted onto the renal transplant waiting list; 80 patients were transplanted during the follow-up period and 60 died (7 following transplantation). Successful transplantation was associated with improved survival (mean survival 4.5 +/- 0.6 years vs. listed not transplanted 4.1 +/- 1.4 years vs. not listed 3.1 +/- 1.7 years; p < 0.001). Ninety-nine patients underwent coronary angiography; 65 had normal or low-grade CAD and 34 obstructive CAD. Seventeen patients (5.6%) were treated by PCI. There was no apparent survival difference between patients who underwent PCI or coronary artery bypass graft compared to those who underwent angiography without intervention or no angiography (p = 0.67). Factors associated with nonlisting for renal transplantation included burden of preexisting cardiovascular disease, poor exercise tolerance and severity of CAD. Pretransplant cardiovascular screening provides prognostic information and information that can be used to restrict access to transplantation. However, if the aim is to identify and treat CAD, the benefits are far from clear."
CD008691,0,18271843,0,Oral intake during hemodialysis: is there an association with intradialytic hypotension?,"Oral intake (OI) of food and fluid has been associated with hypotension during hemodialysis (HD). Trials evaluating this relationship are small. The objective of this study was to quantify OI and to examine its association with hypotension during HD. This is a cross-sectional retrospective chart review study of 3 consecutive HD runs (dialysate iCa=1.25 mmol/L) in 126 stable HD patients (n=378). For each run, the calculation for OI=total ultrafiltration-(net weight loss+IV fluids given). Hypotension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of <100 mmHg at any point during the run. The mean age of the patients was 60.9 years, 38.2% were female, 30.2% had diabetes mellitus, and the majority were Caucasian. The mean (SD) OI was 0.27 (0.352) L/run, range -1.061 to 1.901 L/run, with a normal distribution. In bivariate analysis, there was no correlation of OI with systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or mean blood pressure (BP), and the mean OI did not differ among runs with hypotension (n=78) compared with uncomplicated runs (p=0.93). Oral intake was not predictive of hypotension in a multiple logistic regression model controlling for vintage, age, sex, BP medications, coronary disease, dialysis day and shift, diabetes mellitus, s-Ca, Na and ultrafiltration profiles, and dialysis temperature, even when the analysis was restricted to runs where the patients reached the prescribed dry weight within 0.1 kg. The results of this study suggest that the mean OI during dialysis is just over 0.25 kg, with some patients consuming several kilograms. The clinical significance of OI is uncertain. We did not find an association between OI and hypotension. It is likely that this association was confounded by failure to achieve the prescribed dry weight in a proportion of patients with a high OI, as well as interventions implemented in response to hypotension in previous runs. For example, patients with previous episodes of low BP are advised to limit OI, are prescribed profiles, and so on. There may be other deleterious effects of high OI including hypertension and cardiac disease. The generalizability of the results of this largely Caucasian study population is a recognized limitation. Further prospective and blinded studies are needed to examine the association between OI and hypotension, the long-term clinical consequences of OI, and to define thresholds for recommended OI during dialysis."

To assess its value, redistribution (RD) on SPECT was compared with metabolic imaging using FDG. Thirty patients with coronary artery disease underwent stress-3 hour Tl-201 SPECT and PET using N-13 ammonia and FDG. RD was classified into 4 grading, including complete RD (CR), incomplete RD (IR), persistent defect (PD) and additional minimal RD (MR) defined as no definite RD on visual analysis but faint RD with Bull's eye quantitative analysis (QNT). All but one segment with CR or IR were viable regions (normal or ischemic regions) by PET. Of 74 segments without RD on visual analysis, 31 segments (42%) had RD by QNT (MR). All of them were viable regions by PET. Thus, QNT identified 31 segments (63%) of the metabolically viable segments which the visual Tl-201 analysis did not show RD and classified as myocardial scar. However, even such QNT cannot detect ischemic myocardium in 18 segments (42%) containing metabolic activity on PET. These data indicate that QNT of RD on Tl-201 SPECT is considered as a valuable means for assessing myocardial ischemia."
CD008691,0,15375022,0,Pathophysiology of vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis have 2- to 5-fold more coronary artery calcification than age-matched individuals with angiographically proven coronary artery disease. In addition to increased traditional risk factors, CKD patients also have a number of nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors that may play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of arterial calcification, including duration of dialysis and disorders of mineral metabolism. In histological specimens from the inferior epigastric artery of dialysis patients, we have found expression of the osteoblast differentiation factor core binding factor alpha-1 (Cbfa1) and several bone-associated proteins (osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen) in both the intima and medial layers when calcification was present. In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, the addition of pooled serum from dialysis patients (versus normal healthy controls) accelerated mineralization and increased expression of Cbfa1, osteopontin, and alkaline phosphatase to a similar magnitude as does beta-glycerophosphate alone. However, a lack of inhibitors of calcification may also be important. Dialysis patients with low levels of serum fetuin-A, a circulating inhibitor of mineralization, have increased coronary artery calcification and fetuin-A can inhibit mineralization of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro. These data support that elevated levels of phosphorus and/or other potential uremic toxins may play an important role by transforming vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblast-like cells, which can produce a matrix of bone collagen and noncollagenous proteins. This nidus can then mineralize if the balance of pro-mineralizing factors outweighs inhibitory factors."

CD008691,0,11127308,0,Effect of homocysteine on carotid intima-media thickness after renal transplantation.,"The common carotid intima-media thickness (CC IMT) is a strong predictor for cardiovascular disease in patients with end-stage renal failure. However, little is known about possible associations between potential cardiovascular risk factors such as serum total homocysteine concentrations (tHcy) and the CC IMT. Thus, we investigated (a) the course of tHcy levels after renal transplantation (RTX) and (b) the relationship between CC IMT and tHcy in 53 renal allograft recipients with chronic renal failure before transplantation and 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation. Exclusion criteria were volume overload, symptomatic coronary artery disease, symptomatic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease, diabetes mellitus, severe hypercholesterolemia, and blood pressure above 159/89 mmHg at the time of the investigation. In all renal allograft recipients, a carotid high-resolution B-mode ultrasound measurement of the CC IMT was performed. Eighteen patients had normal ( < 20 micromol/L) pre-transplant (U0) tHcy, 25 had moderately elevated (20-40 micromol/L) pre-transplant (U0) tHcy, and 10 had severely elevated (> 40 micromol/L) pre-transplant (U0) tHcy. After 12 months of follow-up time (U12), no statistically significant differences concerning the tHcy levels could be detected between the groups (average serum tHcy 16.4 micromol/L +/- 1.1 micromol/L). The CC IMT did not differ significantly between the three tHcy groups at any time within the present follow-up. This was also true for the 'wall-to-lumen ratio'. A multiple forward stepwise regression analysis showed that the reduction of the CC IMT was positively correlated with gender (p < 0.01), glucose levels at U12 (p < 0.05; r2 = 0.96), systolic arterial blood pressure at U12 (p < 0.05; r2 = 0.97), and with the intact parathyroid hormone levels at U0 (p < 0.01; r2 = 0.98). In conclusion, (a) tHcy decreases significantly after RTX, but (b) does not influence the CC IMT thickness independently."

The second case (62-year-old male) admitted for operation of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Preoperative CAG showed stenosis of proximal RCA and mid LAD. Stenosis of 4-PD and proximal RCA was relieved by patch angioplasty using saphenous vein graft and coronary artery bypass to LAD was performed by left internal thoracic artery graft. Both cases showed successful enlargement of RCA stenosis and good graft patency at the postoperative CAG. Vein patch angioplasty is thought to be an alternative method for coronary revascularization to ischemic heart disease."
CD008691,0,20586902,0,Screening for cardiovascular disease in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.,"Cardiovascular disease remains the major cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and after renal transplantation. The mechanisms for cardiotoxicity are multiple. Identifying high-risk patients remains a challenge. Given, the poor long-term outcome of dialysis patients who do not receive renal transplantation and the lower supply of donor kidneys relative to demand, optimal selection of renal transplantation candidates is crucial. This requires a clear understanding of the validity of cardiac tests in this patient group. This paper explores the strengths and weaknesses of currently available diagnostic tools in patients with advanced CKD. Echocardiography is very useful for the detection of cardiomyopathy and prognosis. Stress echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging and coronary angiography are the best tools for the assessment of coronary artery disease. All predict outcome. No single gold standard investigation exists. At present, there is not an optimal technique for predicting sudden cardiac death in this patient group. Ultimately, the choice of cardiac test will always be determined by patient preference, local expertise and availability."

Most do not fall into the high-risk categories that are associated with sudden death in the general population. The cause of sudden death in the dialysis population is unknown. It may be related to factors associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) itself, for example, inflammation, vascular stiffness, left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary artery disease, electrolyte/fluid abnormalities or autonomic dysfunction. Studies of patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators have shown that patients with CKD are more likely to use their devices for ventricular arrhythmias but in spite of this still have a high associated mortality. Until a comprehensive risk stratification strategy is understood, minimising risk by good control of basic parameters such as fluid balance, electrolytes and blood pressure, along with careful assessment of all patients for evidence of coronary artery disease and heart failure is the mainstay of management of the CKD patient."

In coronaries, calcified plaques occupied a similar proportion of the intima area in renal versus nonrenal patients (17.3 +/- 11.9 versus 18.1 +/- 11.9%) but occupied a significantly higher proportion of the media (16.6 +/- 10.6 versus 3.8 +/- 2.31%). Expression of the proteins osteocalcin, C-reactive protein, TGF-beta, and collagen IV was significantly more intensive around coronary plaques of renal compared with nonrenal patients. The non-plaque-bearing intima of renal patients showed minimal staining for fetuin, but fetuin staining was seen surrounding calcified plaques. In addition, more pronounced deposition of C5b-9 was found around coronary plaques of renal patients, and glycophorin deposition pointed to more past intraplaque hemorrhage in renal patients. Calcification by electron backscatter analysis is more intense in the coronary media, but not if the intima is more intense in renal compared with nonrenal patients. A more marked inflammatory response in renal patients is suggested by more frequent presence and greater intensity of markers of inflammation."
CD008691,0,12161224,0,Usefulness of rotational spin for coronary angiography in patients with advanced renal insufficiency.,"Coronary angiography in patients with advanced renal insufficiency is typically restricted to cases of life-threatening circumstances such as acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina. To gather a large amount of visual information with a minimum number of cine runs, and consequently, with a minimum volume of contrast medium, we rotated the gantry at 40 degrees /s throughout an angle of 120 degrees, from the right toward the left anterior oblique positions. This technique of rotational spin during cinegraphic runs has not yet become established in invasive cardiology. Three experienced cardiologists independently evaluated all coronary segments in rotational versus standard coronary angiography modes for 15 patients, on the basis of an 11-point scale (0 = cardiac spin far better to 10 = standard mode far better). A score of 5 signified that there was no difference in quality between the 2 modes. The arithmetic mean of the assessment values was 4.9 +/- 0.3 for coronary segments, 5.4 +/- 1.3 for coronary lesions, 5.1 +/- 1.4 for bifurcations, and 5.0 +/- 0.1 for coronary flow. The arithmetic means for the volume of contrast medium (25 +/- 4 ml), for the overall dose area product (8.6 +/- 4.5 Gy x cm(2)), and for the number of cine graphic frames (203 +/- 65) for a diagnostic cardiac spin were significantly below published typical values in standard mode. Cardiac spin enables 3-dimensional coronary impression under conditions of adequate image quality and represents a new, useful, and beneficial method in invasive cardiology for applications involving the special indication of advanced renal insufficiency."
CD008691,0,1844439,0,[Minimal redistribution of thallium-201 representing reversible ischemia after coronary bypass surgery: value of quantitative analysis of exercise thallium-201 SPECT].,"We previously reported the value of minimal redistribution (MR) of thallium-201 in analyzing quantitative polar map analysis (QNT) which correlated well with metabolic activity on FDG-PET. To determine whether ischemic areas that have redistribution are truly reversible, we performed stress and 3-hr delayed thallium-201 SPECT imaging and radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) in 41 patients with coronary artery disease before and after coronary bypass surgery (CABG). Redistribution (RD) was categorized into 4 grades: complete RD (CR), incomplete RD (IR), MR and persistent defect (PD). MR was defined as the segment that showed > or = 2SD improvement in more than 1/3 of the area on QNT, but RD was not evident by visual analysis. 1. QNT identified MR in 30 of 56 segments (54%) where PD is noted by visual inspection. 2. The MR segments showed severer wall motion abnormality (wall motion score: 1.83 +/- 1.12) than did the IR or CR segments (0.99 +/- 1.04) (p < 0.01), but the wall motion was well preserved, compared to the PD segments (2.54 +/- 0.90) (p < 0.01). 3. The grade of RD was compared with improvement in regional perfusion and wall motion on RNV after CABG. Improvement in perfusion was observed in 62 of 77 IR or CR segments (81%) and in 17 of 30 MR segments (57%), but in only 3 of 26 PD segments (12%) (p < 0.01). 4. Similarly, improvement in wall motion was observed in 45 of 57 IR or CR segments (79%) and in 22 of 27 MR segments (81%), but in only 5 of 25 PD segments (20%) (p < 0.01). Thus, the MR segments should be considered reversible after CABG. We conclude that QNT of RD should be performed to detect RD which is slight, yet suggestive of viability."

CD008691,0,8469788,0,Preliminary screening of the relationship of serum lipids to survival of chronic dialysis patients.,"To assess the predictive value of serum lipid measurements in dialysis patients once the initial decrease on early dialysis had occurred, we obtained random serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in stable, chronic dialysis patients who were then followed up to 9 years. Derived LDL (DLDL) was estimated by the Friedewald formula, calculated for all HDL levels between 30 and 45 mg/dL, and evaluated statistically against a panel of vascular disease markers, including clinical assessment for coronary, peripheral, and cerebrovascular disease; ECG, both standard and ambulatory; two-dimensional echocardiogram; and medications. Survival was calculated from entry (not dialysis onset) for 58 hemodialysis and 33 peritoneal dialysis patients. The 91 patients (49 males, 74 diabetics) were divided by cholesterol level (> or = 175 mg/dL = 53, < 175 = 38), triglyceride (> or = 175 mg/dL = 55, < 175 = 36), and DLDL (> or = 75 = 58, < 75 = 24). High total cholesterol was present in a larger proportion of females than low cholesterol, but groups were not different with respect to all vascular determinants, including survival (mean = 33.4 months vs. 43.2, p = NS). High vs. low triglyceride groups were not different with respect to vascular indicators, except for both incidence of abnormal standard ECG (69% vs. 42%, p < 0.05) and survivals (mean = 42.0 vs. 30.7, p < 0.05; 1 year = 80% vs. 56%, p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008691,0,1832984,0,The natural history of myocardial disease in dialysis patients.,"Among dialysis patients, only 23% have a normal echocardiogram, about 10% have recurrent or chronic congestive heart failure, and 17% have asymptomatic ischemic heart disease. The predisposing factors for congestive heart failure are dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic hyperkinetic disease, and ischemic heart disease. Dilated cardiomyopathy, a disorder of systolic function, includes among its risk factors age, hyperparathyroidism, and smoking. Hypertrophic disease results in diastolic dysfunction, and its predictors include age, hypertension, aluminum accumulation, anemia, and, perhaps, hyperparathyroidism. Ischemic heart disease is due to the presence of coronary artery disease and also to nonatherosclerotic disease caused by the reduction in coronary vasodilator reserve and altered myocardial oxygen delivery and use. The clinical outcome of congestive heart failure is comparable to that of nonrenal patients with medically refractory heart failure. Left ventricular hypertrophy is an important independent determinant of survival. A subset have hyperkinetic disease with severe hypertrophy and have a bad survival, as low as 43% have a 2-yr survival after the first admission to hospital with cardiac failure. The prognosis for those with dilated cardiomyopathy is less severe but is worse than those with normal echocardiogram. The survival of patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease was little different from that of patients without symptoms, suggesting that the underlying cardiomyopathies had an adverse impact on survival independent of ischemic disease. Much research needs to be undertaken on the risk factors, natural history, and therapy of the various types of cardiac disease prevalent in dialysis patients."
CD008691,0,2315467,1,Perfusion thallium imaging of type I diabetes patients with end stage renal disease: comparison of oral and intravenous dipyridamole administration.,"Eighty patients with type I diabetes and end stage renal disease were prospectively evaluated for coronary artery disease with dipyridamole-thallium-201 scintigraphy and quantitative coronary angiography. Forty patients received dipyridamole orally, and 40 received it intravenously. The prevalence of coronary artery disease was 53%. There were no significant differences in the accuracy of the two dipyridamole tests (sensitivity = 85%, specificity = 85%, accuracy = 85% for the oral group; sensitivity = 86%, specificity = 72%, accuracy = 79% for the intravenous group). Combining the 80 patients into a single group gave a sensitivity of 86%, a specificity of 79%, and an accuracy of 83% for the detection of coronary disease. Although the accuracy of this test in this patient population was similar to that previously reported for other groups, the prevalence of disease was high and resulted in a low predictive value of a negative test (83%)."
CD008691,0,19670713,0,[Heart valve calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease].,"The aim of the study was to identify factors related to heart valve calcification (HVC) and effect of HVC on intracardiac hemodynamics in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 377 CKD patients of the control group and 132 ones treated by hemodialysis (HD) were examined using echocardiography, cardiomonitoring, measurement of the carotid intima-media thickness and mineral bone density, X-ray imaging of calcified abdominal aorta. HVC was diagnosed in 38.9 and 27.3% of the CKD patients on hemodialysis and without it respectively. In both groups, patients with HVC were older than HVC-free ones, more of them had coronary heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, aortic calcinosis, and biochemically identifiable inflammation. In the absence of hemodialysis, patients with HVC had thicker intima-media compex, lower glomerular filtration rate, higher arterial pressure, and increased occurrence of diabetes mellitus. In HVC patients receiving hemodialysis, its duration was longer, blood PTH and calcium levels higher, forearm MOC lower. HVC associated with stenosis of mitral and aortic valves, aortic regurgitation, enlarged left and right atrium, thickened left and right ventricular wall. Multifactor analysis showed that HVC in patients receiving hemodialysis was related to the age, disbalance of phosporus and sodium, and duration of hemodialysis; in its absence, it was related to intima-media thickness and diabetes mellitus. Thus, in patients of the latter group, HVC was in the first place associated with atherosclerosis aggravated by a decrease of glomerular filtration rate and with the presence of diabetes. In patients receiving hemodialysis, HVC correlated with phosporus/sodium disbalance and atherosclerosis. The study revealed negative effect of HVC on intracardiac hemodynamics and for the first time demonstrated decreased MOC in patients with HYC."
CD008691,0,11747174,0,Reliability of fractional flow reserve measurements in patients with associated microvascular dysfunction: importance of flow on translesional pressure gradient.,"Fractional flow reserve (FFR) has been applied with success as a lesion-specific functional indicator of stenosis severity, at least in patients with normal microcirculation. This study sought to assess the reliability of FFR calculations in patients with associated microvascular dysfunction (e.g., post myocardial infarction, or post-MI). First, the effect of coronary flow changes on translesional pressure gradient was assessed. Therefore, intracoronary pressure and flow was recorded simultaneously across 19 non-infarct-related lesions (both pre- and postinterventional lesions with a mean diameter stenosis of 47% +/- 12%). Measurements were performed by means of a pressure and Doppler wire during maximal hyperemia and also during submaximal hyperemia induced by low-dose adenosine. The drop of coronary flow from 48 +/- 23 ml/min during maximal hyperemia to 36 +/- 18 ml/min during submaximal hyperemia was associated with a small decrease in translesional pressure gradient (from 22 +/- 12 mm Hg to 19 +/- 12 mm Hg; P = 0.02) and a small increase in the mean distal/arterial pressure ratio (Pd/Pa) going from 77% +/- 11% to 81% +/- 11% (P = 0.003). Then, intracoronary pressure and flow measurements were compared across 21 non-infarct-related lesions vs. 22 matched infarct-related lesions. For a similar angiographic stenosis severity (% DS = +/- 44%), maximal flow was 48 +/- 22 ml/min in the non-infarct arteries and 37 +/- 26 ml/min in the infarct arteries (P = 0.03), confirming the presence of severe microvascular dysfunction in infarct regions. Similar to the earlier findings, this hyperemic flow reduction in MI patients was associated with a small increase of FFR (= Pd/Pa): 79% +/- 12% in no MI vs. 83% +/- 12% in MI patients (P = 0.3). A reduction of hyperemic flow by +25%, [correction] such as can be found in patients with severely impaired microvascular function, has a limited effect on FFR calculations (+ 5%). This finding allows the application of standard FFR calculations in a more general population of ischemic heart disease, including patients with recent MI."
CD008691,0,16793151,0,A potential evidence to explain the reason behind the devastating prognosis of coronary artery disease in uraemic patients: renal insufficiency is associated with poor coronary collateral vessel development.,"The potential of individuals to develop coronary collateral circulation is often neglected but is of potential major importance in myocardial vulnerability. Likewise, the effect of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on collateral vessel development is not known. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of CKD on collateral development in patients with advanced coronary artery disease. A total of 171 uraemic patients (serum creatinine > or = 1.5 mg/dl, creatinine clearance < 80 mL)/min) who underwent coronary angiography were evaluated in this study. A total of 134 patients met the criteria for the uraemic group and 134 consecutive non-uraemic patients who constituted the control group. The collateral score (CS) was graded according to the Rentrop classification and the collateral score was calculated by summing the Rentrop numbers of every patient. Collateral vessels have also been categorized according to their anatomic locations and collateral connection grades (CC). CC2 collaterals were observed less frequently in the uraemic patients than in the control subjects (11% versus 26%, p=0.03) and CC0 more frequently (31% versus 22%, p<0.05). Epicardial pathway was detected more frequently in the control subjects than in the uraemic patients (31% versus 12%, p=0.03) and septal pathway less frequently (37% versus 54%). There was a significant negative correlation between CS and creatinine (r=-0.68, p<0.01). The mean CS in the uraemic group was significantly lower than the non-uraemic group (1.29+/-0.88 versus 2.18+/-1.3, p<0.001). These results altogether showed that besides the quantity, quality (functional, haemodynamic and anatomic features) of the uraemic collaterals and a network that they constitute is also impaired and different from the collaterals of the patient with normal renal function."
CD008691,0,18322158,0,Use of cardiac biomarkers in end-stage renal disease.,"Mortality among patients with ESRD remains high because of an excessive cardiovascular risk related to a very high incidence of cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. Identifying serum biomarkers that are useful in profiling cardiovascular risk and enabling stratification of early mortality and cardiovascular risk is an important goal in the treatment of these patients. This review examines current evidence pertaining to the role and utility of two emerging cardiac biomarkers, B-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin T, in patients with ESRD. Together, these data demonstrate how these two cardiac biomarkers may play an adjunctive role to echocardiography in assessing cardiovascular risk and how they may aid in the clinical treatment of these patients."

Although some complications associated with contrast media are mild and transient, contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) can negatively affect long-term patient morbidity and mortality. The incidence of and outcomes from CIN have been carefully studied in cardiology patients. A number of studies have identified CIN-associated complications in PCI patients, including bleeding, hematoma, stroke, adult respiratory distress syndrome, electrolyte imbalances, and sepsis. In post-PCI patients, rates of myocardial infarction and vessel reocclusion are more common in patients with CIN. Therefore, in-hospital mortality is increased in patients with CIN. In patients requiring dialysis after PCI, several studies have shown the 1-year mortality rate to be >55%. Even moderate renal dysfunction not requiring dialysis is associated with increased mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. Precautionary measures before, during, and after the use of contrast media that reduce the incidence of CIN, such as discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications, adequate hydration, and use of appropriate volumes and types of contrast media, should be considered in all patients with renal insufficiency or with other risk factors for CIN."

CD008691,0,19165557,0,Focal myocarditis mimicking myocardial infarction in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.,"Cardiovascular features in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are common. However, RA associated with acute myocarditis is seldom described. Here, we report the case of a 58-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and end stage renal disease who suffered chest tightness and diaphoresis during hemodialysis. The electrocardiogram showed ST elevations and the echocardiographic study revealed abnormalities of regional wall motion with moderate left ventricle dysfunction. Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction was impressed according to clinical presentations and elevated cardiac enzymes. However, emergent coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary stenosis. Magnetic resonance imaging ultimately made the diagnosis of myocarditis. The patient improved gradually without immunosuppressive therapy. This case shows that conservative treatment is a feasible strategy for acute myocarditis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis."
CD008691,0,18638584,0,Effectiveness of anemia and chronic kidney disease as predictors for presence and severity of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing stress myocardial perfusion study.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and anemia portend a higher risk of cardiac events and mortality. We sought to ascertain whether coronary artery disease (CAD) by myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography is more common in patients with CKD (glomerular filtration rate < or =60 ml/min/1.73 kg/m(2)) and/or anemia (hemoglobin level < or =13 g/L) and the impact of different degrees of CKD. One thousand five hundred eighty patients (mean age 65 +/- 10 years) underwent gated myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography and clinical evaluation. Patients were divided into 4 groups (group 1, no anemia/no CKD, n = 800; group 2, anemia/no CKD, n = 195; group 3, CKD/no anemia, n = 332; group 4, anemia/CKD, n = 253). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was undertaken to examine the association of these diagnoses with abnormal myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomogram. Compared with patients with neither diagnosis, an abnormal scan was more common in those with anemia or CKD. Patients with anemia and CKD exhibited more severe CAD (mean summed stress score 6.8 vs 4.7, p <0.01). Established high-risk findings were more prevalent in patients with anemia and/or CKD, including a summed stress score > or =8, transient ischemic dilation, or a left ventricular ejection fraction < or =40% (group 1 28%, group 2 38%, group 3 38%, group 4 48%, all p values <0.01). Patients with moderate CKD demonstrated an increased risk of an abnormal scan (odds ratio 2.66, p <0.0001). After adjustment in multivariate analysis, anemia and CKD each remained predictors for an abnormal scan. The association was stronger in those with the 2 conditions (odds ratio for high-risk scan 1.89, p = 0.0002). In conclusion, in patients with suspected CAD, anemia and CKD are predictors of myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomographic markers for worsened outcomes. The relation was independent of other risk factors, supporting the inclusion of anemia and CKD in global risk assessment for patients with suspected CAD."
CD008691,0,9431840,0,Ischemic renal disease: an emerging cause of chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease.,"Ischemic renal disease (IRD) is defined as a clinically important reduction in glomerular filtration rate or loss of renal parenchyma caused by hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. IRD is a common and often overlooked clinical entity that presents itself in the setting of extrarenal arteriosclerotic vascular disease in older individuals with azotemia. Eleven to 14% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) cases are attributable to chronic IRD. A high percentage of patients entering ESRD programs are hypertensive. Many patients with a presumed diagnosis of hypertensive nephrosclerosis actually have undiagnosed ischemic nephropathy as the etiology of their ESRD. It is important for the clinician to identify IRD, because IRD is a potentially reversible cause of chronic renal failure in a hypertensive patient. Atherosclerotic renal artery disease is common among patients with coronary artery disease and aortic and peripheral vascular disease. Atherosclerotic renal artery disease is a progressive disorder, and its progression is associated with loss of renal mass and functioning. A decrease in glomerular filtration rate sufficient to cause an elevation of the serum creatinine concentration requires injury to both kidneys. Consequently, IRD can arise from one of two main clinical situations: bilateral hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis leading to bilateral renal ischemia; and hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis in a solitary functioning kidney, or in a kidney that is providing the majority of a patient's glomerular filtration. The primary reason for establishing the diagnosis of IRD is the hope that correction of a renal artery stenosis will lead to improvement of renal function, or a delay in progression to ESRD. There are six major clinical settings in which the clinician could suspect IRD: acute renal failure caused by the treatment of hypertension, especially with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; progressive azotemia in a patient with known renovascular hypertension; acute pulmonary edema superimposed upon poorly controlled hypertension and renal failure; progressive azotemia in an elderly patient with refractory or severe hypertension; progressive azotemia in an elderly patient with evidence of atherosclerotic disease; and unexplained progressive azotemia in an elderly patient. Noninvasive testing modalities that have been used recently include the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor renal scan, duplex Doppler sonography, magnetic resonance angiography, and the spiral computed tomography. Treatment methods include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, endovascular stenting, and surgical revascularization. The results of treatment for preservation of renal function have been encouraging, with stabilization or improvement in renal function observed in a significant proportion of cases."
CD008691,0,15591005,0,Therapeutic effects of L-carnitine and propionyl-L-carnitine on cardiovascular diseases: a review.,"Several experimental studies have shown that levocarnitine reduces myocardial injury after ischemia and reperfusion by counteracting the toxic effect of high levels of free fatty acids, which occur in ischemia, and by improving carbohydrate metabolism. In addition to increasing the rate of fatty acid transport into mitochondria, levocarnitine reduces the intramitochondrial ratio of acetyl-CoA to free CoA, thus stimulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and increasing the oxidation of pyruvate. Supplementation of the myocardium with levocarnitine results in an increased tissue carnitine content, a prevention of the loss of high-energy phosphate stores, ischemic injury, and improved heart recovery on reperfusion. Clinically, levocarnitine has been shown to have anti-ischemic properties. In small short-term studies, levocarnitine acts as an antianginal agent that reduces ST segment depression and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. These short-term studies also show that levocarnitine releases the lactate of coronary artery disease patients subjected to either exercise testing or atrial pacing. These cardioprotective effects have been confirmed during aortocoronary bypass grafting and acute myocardial infarction. In a randomized multicenter trial performed on 472 patients, levocarnitine treatment (9 g/day by intravenous infusion for 5 initial days and 6 g/day orally for the next 12 months), when initiated early after acute myocardial infarction, attenuated left ventricular dilatation and prevented ventricular remodeling. In treated patients, there was a trend towards a reduction in the combined incidence of death and CHF after discharge. Levocarnitine could improve ischemia and reperfusion by (1) preventing the accumulation of long-chain acyl-CoA, which facilitates the production of free radicals by damaged mitochondria; (2) improving repair mechanisms for oxidative-induced damage to membrane phospholipids; (3) inhibiting malignancy arrhythmias because of accumulation within the myocardium of long-chain acyl-CoA; and (4) reducing the ischemia-induced apoptosis and the consequent remodeling of the left ventricle. Propionyl-L-carnitine is a carnitine derivative that has a high affinity for muscular carnitine transferase, and it increases cellular carnitine content, thereby allowing free fatty acid transport into the mitochondria. Moreover, propionyl-L-carnitine stimulates a better efficiency of the Krebs cycle during hypoxia by providing it with a very easily usable substrate, propionate, which is rapidly transformed into succinate without energy consumption (anaplerotic pathway). Alone, propionate cannot be administered to patients in view of its toxicity. The results of phase-2 studies in chronic heart failure patients showed that long-term oral treatment with propionyl-L-carnitine improves maximum exercise duration and maximum oxygen consumption over placebo and indicated a specific propionyl-L-carnitine effect on peripheral muscle metabolism. A multicenter trial on 537 patients showed that propionyl-L-carnitine improves exercise capacity in patients with heart failure, but preserved cardiac function."
CD008691,0,6965748,0,Myocardial revascularization in patients with chronic renal failure.,"Symptomatic coronary artery disease in patients with chronic renal failure can complicate their management in a dialysis program. Hypotension associated with hemodialysis and the anemia of chronic renal disease can produce anginal episodes refractory to medical management. Untreated coronary artery disease may be a contraindication to renal transplantation in an otherwise acceptable candidate. We have encountered three cases of coronary artery disease severe enough to necessitate coronary bypass in patients from our long-term hemodialysis program. All three patients had uncomplicated postoperative courses, none had perioperative infarction, and in all three patients postoperative angiography demonstrated patency of all grafts. One patient subsequently underwent successful renal transplantation; the other two patients have continued in hemodialyses since bypass. We believe our experience and the reported experience of others confirm the feasibility of coronary bypass grafting in patients with chronic renal failure."

CD008691,0,9797147,0,Coronary flow and flow reserve in canines using MR phase difference and complex difference processing.,"Coronary artery disease continues to be the leading cause of death for adults in the United States. Magnetic resonance imaging (MR) has the potential to dramatically impact the diagnosis of heart disease by noninvasively providing a wide range of anatomic and physiologic information. Previous research has shown that coronary flow, one component of a complete examination, can be accurately measured in the left anterior descending artery in vivo. The current work validates MR flow measurements in canine circumflex arteries using transit time ultrasound as a standard. The circumflex artery experiences greater in-plane motion and is a more stringent test for flow measurement accuracy. This work also compares two methods of processing MR velocity data, phase difference and complex difference techniques, and examines the sources of error present in the animal validation model. Phase difference processing with a 30% magnitude threshold best matched the mean ultrasound flow values (30% PD = 1.04 x US + 1.49, r = 0.94), but it was very sensitive to vessel boundary identification. The complex difference process was less sensitive to vessel boundary identification and correlated well with the transit time ultrasound despite systematic underestimations. The reasons for the discrepancies are shown to stem from a number of possible sources including variability of the ultrasound standard, low signal-to-noise ratios in the MR images, sensitivity of the MR technique to vessel boundary identification, and motion artifacts in the images."

CD008691,0,14551520,0,Significance of elevated cardiac troponin after percutaneous coronary interventions.,"Assays for cardiac troponin have become a standard for the diagnosis of myocardial damage. Due to their high sensitivity, minor myocardial injury can be frequently detected following percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Minor elevations in cardiac enzymes after apparently successful PCI are rather common and even modest increases in creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) elevation identify a population with worse long-term prognosis compared to patients with no enzyme elevation. The significance of troponin elevation in acute coronary syndromes and its prognostic implications on short- and long-term clinical outcomes were previously demonstrated in several clinical studies. Conversely, data regarding troponin elevation after an apparently successful PCI is limited and their relevance in terms of predicting clinical outcomes remains unclear. Given the higher sensitivity of troponin essays, the incidence of troponin elevation after PCI is higher than that of CK-MB. In this review we discuss the significance and implications of post-procedural troponin elevation."

CD008691,0,12694342,0,Cardiovascular risk in patients with mild renal insufficiency.,"We reviewed the evidence linking mild renal insufficiency (MRI) to an increased cardiovascular risk. A number of cardiovascular risk factors become prevalent with MRI, including night-time hypertension, increase in lipoprotein(a), in homocysteine, in asymmetric dimethyl-arginine (ADMA), markers and mediators of inflammation, and insulin resistance. Also, an epidemiologic association between coronary artery disease and nephrosclerosis, a frequent cause of mild renal insufficiency in the elderly, is documented. In the middle-aged, general population MRI, found in 8% of women and 9% of men, was not associated with cardiovascular disease. However, in a representative sample of middle-aged British men, the risk of stroke was 60% higher for the subgroup of people with MRI; in people at high cardiovascular risk (mostly coronary disease), the HOPE study found a 2-fold (unadjusted), or 1.4-fold (adjusted), higher incidence of cardiovascular outcomes with MRI. The incidence of primary outcome increased with the level of serum creatinine. Several studies determined the cardiovascular risk associated with MRI in hypertension. In HDFP, as in HOPE, cardiovascular mortality increased with higher serum creatinine (five-fold difference in cardiovascular mortality between the lowest and the highest creatinine strata). The risk associated with renal insufficiency was independent from other classic cardiovascular risk factors. In hypertensives with low risk, the HOT, and a small Italian trial found about a doubling in cardiovascular outcomes in MRI. However, in MRFIT, increase in follow-up creatinine predicted future cardiovascular disease, not baseline creatinine. These observational data suggest that MRI, independent of etiology, is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease, present in 10% of a population at low risk, and up to 30% at high cardiovascular risk. No prospective therapeutic trials, aimed at reducing the cardiovascular burden in people with MRI, are available. Subgroup analyses of the HOPE study indicate that ACE inhibition with ramipril is beneficial without an increased risk for side effects like acute renal failure or hyperkalemia. Thus, the frequent practice of withholding ACE inhibitors from patients with mild renal insufficiency is unwarranted, especially since this identifies a group at high risk that appears to benefit most from treatment. In addition, there is evidence that ACE inhibitors improve renal outcomes in renal insufficiency. Prospective studies should test the predictive power of MRI for cardiovascular disease and therapeutic options."

The aim of the study was to compare the prevalence and advancement of vascular calcification in patients with end-stage diabetic nephropathy on peritoneal dialysis and diabetic patients with chronic renal disease stages 2-4. The study group included 31 patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy divided into 2 groups: 12 patients (aged 50-74 years: mean 58.6+/-8.8) undergoing peritoneal dialysis and 19 patients (aged 46-82 years; mean 65.8+/-9.7) with chronic kidney disease stages 2-4 (GFR range 24-78 ml/min/1.73 m2). Coronary artery calcification score, was assessed using multi-slice computed tomography. Coronary artery calcification score did not differ significantly between groups (CaSc values 1085.2 vs 452.4 AgU; NS). The patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis showed significantly higher levels of parathyroid hormone (658.2 vs. 74.3 pg/ml; p=0.001), fibrinogen (5.82 vs. 3.89 g/l; p<0.0001) and alkaline phosphatase (330.9 vs. 168.0 U/l; p=0.001). Despite more advanced abnormalities in calcium-phosphate balance parameters and more active inflammation in peritoneal dialysis subjects we failed to demonstrate any statistically significant difference in coronary artery calcification score between patients with diabetic nephropathy on peritoneal dialysis and those with chronic kidney disease stages 2-4."

CD008691,0,19323066,0,[Ischemia modified albumin--specific marker in cardiological diagnostics?].,"Ischemia modified albumin (IMA) is a new biological marker for early identification of chest pain and ruling out myocardial infarction among patients with acute syndromes submitting to emergency department. Recently IMA has been investigated in the light of other cardiac markers (cTnT, CK-MBmas, NT-proBNP) in various states of ischemia (acute coronary syndromes, after percutaneous coronary intervention, in coronary vasospasm). Ischemia modified albumin levels were elevated in these states what suggests myocardial ischemia. However decrease in IMA concentration after exercise-induced skeletal muscle ischemia still remains unclear. Increased IMA concentration in patients with acute ischemic stroke and exposed to trauma limits its ability for detection myocardial ischemia. Specificity of IMA measurement is limited also in patients with peripheral vascular disease, systemic sclerosis, diabetes, end stage renal disease, pulmonary embolism and other pathological states with accompanying oxidative stress."

From 1,009 systemic sclerosis hospital admissions, 11 (1.09%) were for an acute MI. Three of these patients had normal coronaries, and instead of wall motion abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy was the predominant finding of an echocardiography. The odds ratio of finding normal coronaries in systemic sclerosis vs the general population who develops an acute MI is 33.89 (14.08-81.39). Seven of our patients had an elevated creatinine level on presentation. Acute MI is an uncommon manifestation in systemic sclerosis patients.

CD008691,0,11725913,0,Coronary artery disease among diabetic and non-diabetic patients with end stage renal disease.,"Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death among patients with end stage renal disease and accounts for about half the deaths among the dialysis population. Several researchers have reported a high prevalence of coronary artery disease among diabetic patients with renal failure and coronary arteriography is often considered an integral part of the pre-transplant evaluation of diabetic patients with end stage renal disease. However, very few reports have addressed the question of coronary disease in non-diabetic patients, and the pattern and prevalence of coronary artery disease in non-diabetic patients with end stage renal disease are not well defined. We evaluated the clinical and coronary angiographic findings in 158 consecutive patients (84 diabetic and 74 non-diabetic) with end stage renal disease. The coronary arteries were divided into 16 segments and each segment was analyzed for the presence of coronary disease, which was defined as the presence of > or = 50% luminal diameter stenosis. Diabetic patients had more adverse risk factors for coronary artery disease, yet there was no significant difference in the prevalence of coronary artery disease between the diabetic and non-diabetic patients (67% vs. 55%, p = 0.15), or in the number of affected coronary artery segments (2.0 vs. 1.4, p = 0.05). Triple vessel coronary artery disease was however, significantly more common among the diabetic subjects (27% vs. 12%, p = 0.005). Non-diabetic patients with end stage renal disease also have a high prevalence of coronary artery disease and may merit as careful investigation of their coronary status as their diabetic counterparts."

Our case is a 60-year-old female with unstable angina due to restenosis of the proximal LAD following PTCA and proximal stenosis of the large first diagonal branch (D1). She underwent double vessel MIDCAB (LITA-LAD and LITA-RIEA-D1) using Y composite arterial conduit with LITA and right epigastric artery (RIEA), because of chronic renal failure on maintenance hemodialysis.

CD008691,0,11576920,0,"The heart in uremia: role of hypertension, hypotension, and sleep apnea.","Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in end-stage renal disease. Causes include those usually found in the general population, those related to the uremic status, and those related to dialytic treatment. Hypertension, hypotension, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, malnutrition, dyslipidemia, reactive C protein, calcium-phosphate product, dialysis modalities, and hyperhomocysteinemia are discussed extensively. Special emphasis is put on hyperparathyroidism as a traditional toxin. The emergent role of sleep apnea has been confirmed in animal models as well as in humans studied using polysomnography. There are difficulties in diagnosing coronary disease, because angiography is not risk-free, is expensive, and should be reserved for patients having symptoms of heart failure and/or patients having diabetes mellitus, and/or patients entering a transplantation list. This allows patients with coronary disease to undergo coronary artery bypass (preferably) or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Patients for whom surgery is not appropriate should be treated using more traditional medical procedures."
CD008691,0,16923438,0,Prevalence and predictors of cardiovascular calcium in chronic kidney disease (from the Prospective Longitudinal RRI-CKD Study).,"Although the determinants of cardiovascular calcium have been well described in dialysis patients, the prevalence and predictors in predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) are less known. One hundred six patients with CKD from the Renal Research Institute-CKD Study underwent multidetector computed tomography for the assessment of calcium deposition at the level of coronary arteries, thoracic aorta, aortic valve, and mitral valve. Cardiovascular risk factors and renal function-related parameters (glomerular filtration rate, glomerular filtration rate slope, serum creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, hemoglobin, albumin, calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone) were included in multivariate regression models to predict cardiovascular calcium. Prevalences of calcium deposition at the level of coronary arteries, thoracic aorta, aortic valve, and mitral valve were 69%, 46%, 39%, and 16%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, coronary artery calcium score was predicted by age (p < 0.0001), gender (p = 0.0001), diabetes (p = 0.024), and history of coronary artery disease (p = 0.016), but not by renal function related parameters. Similarly, renal function related parameters were not predictive of aortic or valvular calcium. In conclusion, predialysis CKD is associated with a high prevalence of cardiovascular calcium. The extent of cardiovascular calcium in patients with predialysis CKD is related to some of the traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis but not to indexes of abnormal renal function or progression in renal dysfunction."
CD008691,0,15580159,0,Current advances in the diagnosis and treatment of renal artery stenosis.,"Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a common condition associated with hypertension and renal insufficiency. The high prevalence of RAS patients with coronary and lower extremity vascular disease has been well established. Fibromuscular dysplasia in young females and atherosclerosis in patients over the age of 55 are the most common causes. Poorly controlled hypertension refractory to medical therapy, worsening of renal function, and flash pulmonary edema may point to underlying RAS. Duplex ultrasonography and magnetic resonance angiography have largely replaced captopril scanning for RAS screening. However, renal angiography still remains the gold standard to diagnose RAS. Treatment options include medical therapy, angioplasty, and surgery. In general, patients with a stenosis greater than 50%, a translesional systolic pressure gradient greater than 15 mm Hg, and difficult-to-control hypertension and/or worsening renal insufficiency are candidates for renal revascularization. Percutaneous transluminal revascularization has evolved to become the preferred revascularization therapy because it is a less invasive and more cost-effective alternative to surgery and is associated with high technical success, as well as a low complication rate. The natural history of RAS is to progress over time, leading to renal artery occlusion, loss of renal mass, worsening of renal function, and, ultimately, end-stage renal disease. It is therefore important to aggressively screen, recognize, and treat the entity early in its course."

CD008691,0,12515377,0,Electron beam tomography to image cardiovascular calcifications in hemodialysis patients.,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in western countries and it is especially frequent in dialysis patients. Though for a long time physicians have been mainly focused on the severity of luminal coronary stenosis, atherosclerosis starts and expands in the contest of the arterial wall much before it extends into the vessel lumen. Indeed, most acute coronary events occur in patients with non-obstructive luminal disease. On pathological examination patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) show larger and more extensively calcified atherosclerotic lesions than non-uremic patients. Recent evidence shows that even very young dialysis patients show premature calcification of the coronary arteries. Therefore, early detection of atherosclerotic disease with a non-invasive imaging technology such as electron beam tomography (EBT) may provide an opportunity to modify the disease course and reduce the related event rate."

CD008691,0,12395219,0,The heart in Anderson Fabry disease.,"Anderson Fabry disease is a life threatening, X-linked inborn metabolic defect of the lysosomal enzyme áalpha-galactosidase A. The deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A leads to a progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb(3)), the major glycosphingolipid substrate of the enzyme, within vulnerable cells, tissues, and organs, including the cardiovascular system. Cardiac involvement is frequent and patients with cardiac affection develop progressive hypertrophic infiltrative cardiomyopathy, valvular abnormalities, arrhythmias, and conduction abnormalities and may develop coronary heart disease. Hemizygous male patients have no detectable alpha-galactosidase A activity, while affected heterozygous females may have normal level of alpha-galactosidase A activity. Death occurs in male patients at 45 to 50 years, about 15 to 20 years earlier than in female patients due to a vicious circle from chronic renal insufficiency, arterial hypertension, atherosclerotic lesions and cerebrovascular hemorrhage or insults, and cardiomyopathy.

This study aimed to determine whether an association exists between phosphorus levels and coronary artery calcium levels in a community-based cohort of 3015 healthy young adults in the prospective Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Phosphorus levels were measured at baseline, and presence of coronary artery calcium was assessed by computed tomography 15 yr later. Mean age at study inception was 25.2 yr, and the mean levels of phosphorus and calcium were 3.6 and 9.5 mg/dl, respectively. Only 0.2% of participants had estimated GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Phosphorus levels were associated with coronary artery calcium in unadjusted models. In multivariate models, however, phosphorus levels were significantly associated with the category of coronary artery calcium level. In conclusion, higher serum phosphorus levels, even within the normal range, may be a risk factor for coronary artery atherosclerosis in healthy young adults."

CD008691,0,14609589,0,Renal insufficiency is an independent predictor of mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention.,"The present study was designed to evaluate whether the presence of renal disease during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with worse outcomes at 1 year in a multicenter study. The incidence of death, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, repeat PCI, and repeat revascularization were prospectively collected on 4,602 patients (6,542 lesions) in 2 waves of patients who underwent PCI in 17 centers between July 1997 and June 1999. Renal disease was defined as the presence of an increased creatinine level in a patient with a history or presence of renal failure treated with low protein diet or dialysis. Patients with renal disease (n = 192) were older and more likely to have diabetes, heart failure, reduced ejection fraction, known coronary disease, and multivessel disease than patients without renal disease (n = 4,410). Rates of stenting were equivalent (68.2% vs 73.0%, p = NS). Patients with renal disease had lower angiographic success (84.9% vs 92.8%, p <0.001) and higher mortality, both in-hospital (5.7% vs 1.2%, p <0.001) and at 1 year (19.7% vs 4.4%, p <0.0001). After adjusting for clinical, demographic, and angiographic differences, renal disease remained an independent predictor of in-hospital (odds ratio 3.81, 95% confidence interval 1.70 to 8.58) and 1-year (risk ratio 2.46, 95% confidence interval 1.64 to 3.68) mortality. Renal disease conferred additional mortality risk in established high-risk clinical subgroups. In conclusion, after adjusting for a higher frequency of co-morbidities, renal disease remains a strong and independent predictor of increased in-hospital and 1-year mortality after PCI and is additive to other clinical markers of worse outcome."

There was no operative mortality and in all patients satisfactory renal function was maintained perioperatively. Hospital stay ranged from 7 days to 10 days (mean: 8 days). During the period of follow-up (5-72 months, mean: 35 months): one patient remained angina-free at 7 months postoperatively; one patient developed meningitis with Listeria monocytogenes 9 weeks after surgery, and died of streptococcal septicaemia 11 weeks later. The other five patients (71.4%) developed recurrence of angina requiring antianginal therapy, and three of them sustained myocardial infarctions. Three patients developed intermittent claudication, two of whom sustained acute leg ischaemia. Two patients developed heart failure, one of whom died 38 months postoperatively. In four patients who were restudied with cardiac catheterisation and coronary angiography (2-17 months postoperatively) there was evidence of progression of the coronary arterial disease in three, although all coronary grafts were patent. Renal function remained satisfactory in 5 patients, and deteriorated in two patients; in one secondary to advanced heart failure; and in one as a terminal event secondary to septicaemia. Although patients with renal transplants can safely undergo open cardiac procedures, the long-term results of coronary surgery are adversely affected by the progressive disease from which they suffer."

CD008691,0,8361888,0,[The effect of blood pressure changes during hemodialysis on left ventricular systolic function].,"Echocardiographic study was performed in 31 uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) with no apparent heart failure, valvular heart disease, pericardial effusion or coronary artery disease. On the basis of blood pressure patients were classified into two groups: 1) patients with normal arterial pressure (group I) (n = 19), 2) patients with blood hypertension (group II) (n = 12). Cardiac function was assessed immediately before and after HD session. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (EDD), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (ESD) and ejection fraction (EF) were calculated. Body weight, heart rate and mean blood pressure (mBP) were also measured. A significant decrease of EDD was noted in both groups during HD but it was less evident in group II (p < 0.05). ESD decreased significantly in group II (p < 0.01) when it did not change in group I. EF increased significantly only in group II (p < 0.05). Blood pressure decreased during HD in both groups. A significant inverse linear association between EF and ESD was noted during HD in both groups (r = -0.685; p < 0.001) but was more evident in group II. There was no association between and EDD (r = 0.199; NS). Similar analysis shows that ESD was significantly with mBP (group II--r = 0.914; p < 0.001, group I--r = 0.565; p < 0.05). Such association were not found for EDD and RR. Only in group II the decrease in mBP was statistical significantly correlated with the increase in EF. The decrease in EDD during HD exists probably due to changes in intravascular volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008691,0,16551290,0,Inflammatory biomarkers and cardiovascular risk: association or cause and effect?,"With the current understanding that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder, markers of the associated systemic inflammatory response have been extensively studied as predictors of cardiovascular disease. Recently the use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has been proposed for risk assessment in individuals at intermediate risk of coronary heart disease. The traditional view of inflammatory biomarkers, including CRP, regards them as risk markers rather than risk factors. Either category of marker would serve a diagnostic role, monitor disease activity, and indicate the efficacy of therapy or changing prognosis. However a risk factor with a causal role would be a potential target for therapy. This review discusses the available evidence that argues for and against a causal role for inflammatory biomarkers, with specific reference to CRP, in the atherosclerotic process."

CD008691,0,11158864,0,Imaging of cardiovascular calcifications with electron beam tomography in hemodialysis patients.,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Western countries and it is especially frequent in dialysis patients. Although for a long time physicians have been mainly focused on the severity of luminal coronary stenosis, atherosclerosis starts and expands in the thickness of the arterial wall much before it extends into the vessel lumen. Indeed, most acute coronary events occur in patients with non-obstructive luminal disease. On pathologic examination, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) show larger and more extensively calcified atherosclerotic lesions than non-dialysis patients. Recent evidence shows that even very young dialysis patients show premature calcification of the coronary arteries. Therefore, early detection of atherosclerotic disease with a non-invasive imaging technology, such as electron beam tomography (EBT), may provide an opportunity to modify the disease course and reduce the related event rate."

There is a high prevalence of silent CAD in these patients. Controversy exists regarding the role of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in detection of CAD.

CD008691,0,20113272,0,Cystatin C and creatinine as markers for radiocontrast-induced nephropathy in patients treated with N-acetylcysteine.,"The beneficial effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in the prevention of radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RCIN) as well as the definition of an adequate surrogate parameter for the evaluation of the incidence of RCIN remain points of controversial discussion. Nearly all clinical studies used an increase in serum creatinine to define renal injury, although cystatin C is suggested to be superior to creatinine in estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Furthermore, a recent study showed that in healthy volunteers, NAC leads to a decrease in serum creatinine without influencing serum cystatin C concentrations, implicating a possible overestimation of the protective effect of NAC on the incidence of RCIN. We compared serum creatinine and cystatin C levels in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing coronary angiography, as these patients are to be considered at highest risk for the development of RCIN. A total of three doses of NAC was given orally, and patients received isotonic saline intravenously. Serum levels at baseline and 24 hours after angiography were not significantly different for serum creatinine (1.72 +/- 0.08 mg/dl and 1.72 +/- 0.08 mg/dl) and for cystatin C (1.72 +/- 0.09 mg/dl and 1.76 +/-0.10 mg/dl). There was a significant positive correlation between creatinine and cystatin C serum levels before and after exposure to radiocontrast medium (p < 0.05) in all patients, including subgroup analyses. We conclude that serum creatinine and cystatin C are equivalent surrogate parameters for the evaluation of NAC in the prevention of RCIN. Furthermore, we present a prophylactic treatment regime easily applicable even in an outpatient setting, which seems to protect very effectively against RCIN in a high-risk group of patients."
CD008691,0,20345389,0,Impact of coronary artery calcification in hemodialysis patients: Risk factors and associations with prognosis.,"The risk factors of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and the impact of CAC on cardiovascular events, cardiovascular deaths, and all-cause deaths in hemodialysis (HD) patients have not been fully elucidated. We examined the CAC score (CACS) in 74 HD patients using electron-beam computed tomography. Fifty-six patients underwent a second electron-beam computed tomography after a 15-month interval to evaluate CAC progression. We evaluated (1) the risk factors for CAC and its progression and (2) the impact of CAC on the prognosis. In the cross-sectional study, HD vintage and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were the independent risk factors for CAC. In the prospective cohort study, delta CACS (progression of CAC) was significantly correlated with hsCRP, fibrinogen, and serum calcium level in the univariate analysis. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that only hsCRP was the independent risk factor for CAC progression in HD patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that cardiovascular events (P<0.0001), cardiovascular deaths (P=0.039), and all-cause deaths (P=0.026) were significantly associated with CACS. In conclusion, CAC had significantly progressed in HD patients during the 15-month observation period. Microinflammation was the only independent risk factor for CAC progression in HD patients. The advanced CAC was a significant prognostic factor in HD patients, i.e., which was strongly associated with future cardiovascular events, cardiovascular deaths, and all-cause deaths."
CD008691,0,8932262,1,Evaluation of diabetic patients for renal and pancreas transplantation: noninvasive screening for coronary artery disease using radionuclide methods.,"Pharmacologic stress thallium scintigraphy is commonly performed in the risk assessment of diabetic patients with nephropathy before kidney and/or pancreas transplantation; however, controversy exists regarding the test's accuracy in detecting coronary artery disease. Our purpose was to compare pharmacologic stress thallium scintigraphy and also exercise radionuclide ventriculography with coronary angiography in diabetic patients undergoing evaluation for transplantation. In addition, we also determined the association of the test results with outcome after transplantation. The medical records of 47 patients (mean age, 37+/-9 years) without clinical evidence of coronary artery disease were reviewed. Forty-one patients had pharmacologic stress thallium scintigraphy performed during their evaluation. Sensitivity was 62% and specificity was 76% for detecting > or = 75% coronary artery stenosis (sensitivity was 53% and specificity was 73% for > or = 50% stenosis). Thirty-five patients had exercise radionuclide ventriculography performed. Sensitivity was 50% and specificity was 67% for detecting > or = 75% coronary artery stenosis (sensitivity was 44% and specificity was 63% for > or = 50% stenosis). Thirty patients had both pharmacologic stress thallium scintigraphy and exercise radionuclide ventriculography performed; when either test was abnormal, sensitivity in the detection of > or = 50% or > or = 75% stenosis tended to increase compared with pharmacologic stress thallium scintigraphy alone (0.05<P<0.10), whereas specificity decreased (P<0.01). The incidence of adverse cardiac outcomes was identical for patients with abnormal thallium scintigrams and undergoing transplantation (2/11) compared with patients with normal scintigrams and undergoing transplantation (4/22). We conclude that: (1) pharmacologic stress thallium scintigraphy and exercise radionuclide ventriculography are suboptimal screening tests for coronary artery disease in diabetic patients awaiting kidney and/or pancreas transplantation; (2) using the two radionuclide tests in combination results in a decrease in specificity; and (3) patients with abnormal thallium scintigrams can receive transplants with outcomes similar to those for patients with normal thallium scintigrams."

CD008691,0,17040978,0,The treatment of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Premature cardiovascular disease is the largest cause of mortality, and a major cause of morbidity, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at extreme risk, but cardiovascular event rates are increased even in early CKD. There is little controlled trial evidence on which to base treatment, as most therapeutic trials have excluded CKD patients. Current treatment strategies are therefore based upon small prospective studies or retrospective analyses of controlled trials and registry data. It is thus unclear whether CKD patients benefit from modern secondary preventive treatments in the same manner as patients with normal renal function. There is a need for randomized trials to identify effective drugs to prevent and treat coronary artery disease in CKD. Revascularization by CABG in CKD has been widely reported in registry data to provide better results than medical treatment or angioplasty. Recent angioplasty data in patients with CKD, however, show improving results, and the risks of CABG in CKD remain high. It is not clear which revascularization technique has a better outcome in patients 'equally suitable' on angiographic criteria for either procedure. The high rate of late adverse cardiovascular events after both CABG and angioplasty accentuates the need for effective secondary preventive therapy disease in these high-risk patients."

CD008691,0,14688493,0,Physician-nurse team approaches to improve blood pressure control.,"Hypertension is an asymptomatic chronic disease that contributes to the development of serious health problems including coronary artery disease, chronic renal failure, and stroke. Despite published guidelines addressing goals for the treatment of hypertension, control rates (defined as a blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg) have not increased in recent years, and uncontrolled hypertension remains a serious public health issue. Both patient- and provider-related factors contribute to these poor control rates, and new approaches to the management of hypertension must be sought. In this review, we describe unique physician-nurse team approaches to improve the control of hypertension both in a subspecialty hypertension practice and in a primary care clinic setting. By implementing practice models that result in sustainable improvements in blood pressure control rates, the morbidity and mortality resulting from target organ damage and ensuing costs to society may be expected to decline as well."
CD008691,0,9604070,0,CMV infection is associated with transplant renal artery stenosis.,"Transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) is a significant cause of graft dysfunction, with no clearly defined aetiology. Evidence suggests a role for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in cardiac transplant vasculopathy and in native coronary artery restenosis after angioplasty. We investigated the relationship between CMV infection after renal transplantation and subsequent development of TRAS. Of 917 patients receiving renal transplants at a single centre from 1978 to 1994, 75 had TRAS diagnosed by angiography. Each was paired with a control transplanted patient with no TRAS, matched for age, sex, year of transplant and number of grafts. Incidence of CMV infection between transplantation and the time of diagnosis of TRAS was assessed in both groups, using clinical and serological criteria to assign patients to three groups: definite CMV infection (CMV-DEF), possible infection (CMV-POSS) and no evidence of infection (CMV-NUL). CMV-DEF was significantly more common in TRAS than in controls (36 vs. 12, respectively, p < 0.001) and CMV-NUL was less common (TRAS 15, controls 33). We have previously reported an increased incidence of acute rejection in patients with TRAS. The subset of patients with no rejection episodes also had significantly more CMV-DEF cases in the TRAS group (54%) than in controls (10%) (p = 0.002). The data are consistent with the hypothesis that CMV infection can contribute to the development of TRAS. The relationship between CMV and TRAS did not arise from an excess of anti-rejection treatment in the TRAS group. CMV-induced large-vessel damage in immunosuppressed patients may occur through local infection and the mitogenic actions of viral gene products within cells of the vessel wall."
CD008691,0,19764492,0,[Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery for the ischemic cardiomyopathy patient with moderate mitral regurgitation and stenosis of bilateral vertebral arteries].,"We report a 71-year-old man who had severe coronary and cerebral vascular disease with moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). Left ventricular reconstruction and mitral valve surgery were considered for poor left ventricular function and dilatation with MR. However, low blood pressure during cardiac arrest was risk for stroke due to severe stenosis of bilateral vertebral arteries. The myocardial viability of the anterior wall and inferior wall was confirmed by thallium-201 rest-redistribution single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Therefore, off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) was selected for the patient. Only three Lima sutures were used for keeping the optimal heart position. Coronary anastomoses were done in sequence right gastroepiploic artery (RGEA)-#4 posterior descending (PD), left internal thoracic artery (LITA)-#9-#14 (sequential), RITA-#8 left anterior descending (LAD). No neurological complication occurred postoperatively. Left ventricular function and MR gradually improved. Final ejection fraction (EF) is 51% and MR is trivial.

The Perfect Study Collaborative Group.,"A randomised trial of simvastatin and enalapril in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis: effects on serum lipoprotein concentrations and left ventricular mass. Left ventricular hypertrophy and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism are both possible contributors to the high risk of cardiovascular death in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis. We investigated the effects of simvastatin on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and the effects of enalapril on left ventricular mass in 107 patients receiving haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Patients were randomised in a factorial design to receive simvastatin (10 mg daily) or placebo and enalapril (2.5-5 mg daily) or placebo. During follow-up, there was a significant excess of patients withdrawn from enalapril because of hypotension (2p = 0.002), and after 6 months only 55% of those assigned enalapril were still on treatment. From baseline to 6 months, there were no statistically significant differences in left ventricular mass or left ventricular dimensions between patients assigned enalapril and those assigned placebo. Among the patients assigned simvastatin, total cholesterol was reduced by 13% (2p = 0.001), LDL cholesterol was reduced by 17% (2p = 0.003) and apolipoprotein B was reduced by 12% (2p = 0.005) compared to patients assigned placebo. There were borderline significant (2p = 0.05 to 0.08) reductions in VLDL cholesterol, total triglyceride and VLDL triglycerides of 26%, 12% and 17% respectively.

CD008691,0,6600759,0,Prospective assessment of regional myocardial perfusion before and after coronary revascularization surgery by quantitative thallium-201 scintigraphy.,"Because thallium-201 uptake relates directly to the amount of viable myocardium and nutrient blood flow, the potential for exercise scintigraphy to predict response to coronary revascularization surgery was investigated in 47 consecutive patients. All patients underwent thallium-201 scintigraphy and coronary angiography at a mean (+/- standard deviation) of 4.3 +/- 3.1 weeks before and 7.5 +/- 1.6 weeks after surgery. Thallium uptake and washout were computer-quantified and each of six segments was defined as normal, showing total or partial redistribution or a persistent defect. Persistent defects were further classified according to the percent reduction in regional thallium activity; PD25-50 denoted a 25 to 50% constant reduction in relative thallium activity and PD greater than 50 denoted a greater than 50% reduction. Of 82 segments with total redistribution before surgery, 76 (93%) showed normal thallium uptake and washout postoperatively, versus only 16 (73%) of 22 with partial redistribution (probability [p] = 0.01). Preoperative ventriculography revealed that 95% of the segments with total redistribution had preserved wall motion, versus only 74% of those with partial redistribution (p = 0.01). Of 42 persistent defects thought to represent myocardial scar before surgery, 19 (45%) demonstrated normal perfusion postoperatively. Of the persistent defects that showed improved thallium perfusion postoperatively, 75% had normal or hypokinetic wall motion before surgery, versus only 14% of those without improvement (p less than 0.001). Whereas 57% of the persistent defects that showed a 25 to 50% decrease in myocardial activity demonstrated normal thallium uptake and washout postoperatively, only 21% of the persistent defects with a decrease in myocardial activity greater than 50% demonstrated improved perfusion after surgery (p = 0.02). Thus, preoperative quantitative thallium-201 scintigraphy appears useful in predicting response to revascularization surgery, and some persistent defects may revert to normal thallium uptake after surgery. Importantly, the preoperative distinction between viable and nonviable myocardium can be reasonably established by quantitating the amount of persistent reduction in thallium uptake and correlating this with preoperative wall motion."

The objective of the study was to determine these outcomes and their predictors in hospitalized patients after LHC. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality and Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors determining LOS in 9,420 consecutive patients hospitalized for LHC. Odds ratio for in-hospital mortality and hazard ratio for prolonged LOS were derived. The strongest predictors of mortality were advanced age, left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure (EDP), LV ejection fraction (EF), systemic blood pressure, and renal insufficiency. Predictors of prolonged LOS were LVEDP, LVEF, 3-vessel coronary artery disease, and valvular disease. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with an LVEF > or =50% were also compared with those of patients with an LVEF <50%. Predictors of mortality and LOS remained the same for patients with an LVEF <50%. For an LVEF > or =50%, LVEDP also determined LOS and chronic renal insufficiency provided predictive power to mortality and LOS in this subgroup. In conclusion, several readily attainable clinical and laboratory parameters predict inpatient mortality and LOS in hospitalized patients referred for LHC."

CD008691,0,15939068,0,Plasma homocysteine predicts progression of atherosclerosis.,"MINI ABSTRACT: Three emerging risk factors potentially useful in predicting future cardiac events are electron-beam computed tomography (EBT), homocysteine(HCY), and C-reactive Protein (CRP). We evaluated a cohort of 133 serial asymptomatic patients, who underwent two consecutive EBT scans (8-84 months apart) and a comprehensive cardiac risk factor assessment, including measurements for lipids, ultrasensitive CRP and homocysteine. Individuals with elevated HCY (> or =12 micromol/L) demonstrated a mean increase in CC progression of 35% per year, while those with HCY <12 micromol/L (median) progressed at 17% per year (p = 0.0008). Patients with a level equal to or lower than the median value of CRP (0.8 mg/L) had a median yearly progression of 22%, compared to 21% for those with CRP value = 0.9-11 mg/L (p = ns). Presence of elevated HCY (>12 micromol/L) strongly and independently predicts progression of coronary plaque burden."

Indications for surgery were congestive heart failure in 8 patients (16%), angina in 20 (40%), ventricular arrhythmias in 4 (8%), and critical left main stem disease in 12 (24%). Twenty-two patients (44%) had emergency surgery for critical anatomy and unstable symptoms. The number of grafts per patient was 3.7 +/- 0.8. Seventeen patients (34%) required intra-aortic balloon pump support, 16 (32%) needed pacing, and 48 (96%) had inotropic support postoperatively. Morbidity included re-operation for bleeding (2%), acute renal failure (10%), hemodialysis (4%), and fatal multiorgan failure (4%). Postoperative (4.9 +/- 3.7 months) 2-dimentional echocardiography was available in 18 patients of whom 11 (61%) showed improved left ventricular function (range, 5% to 45%). Thirty-day hospital mortality was 8%. These data indicate that surgical revascularization can be performed safely with acceptable hospital mortality in high-risk patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction."

CD008691,0,15504944,0,Association of chronic kidney disease and anemia with physical capacity: the heart and soul study.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and anemia are common conditions in the outpatient setting, but their independent and additive effects on physical capacity have not been well characterized. The association of CKD and anemia with self-reported physical function was evaluated and exercise capacity was measured in patients with coronary disease. A cross-sectional study of 954 outpatients enrolled in the Heart and Soul study was performed. CKD was defined as a measured creatinine clearance <60 ml/min, and anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level of <12g/dl. Physical function was self-assessed using the physical limitation subscale of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (0 to 100), and exercise capacity was defined as metabolic equivalent tasks achieved at peak exercise. In unadjusted analyses, CKD was associated with lower self-reported physical function (67.6 versus 74.9; P < 0.001) and lower exercise capacity (5.5 versus 7.9; P < 0.001). Similarly, anemia was associated with lower self-reported physical function (62.6 versus 74.3; P < 0.001) and exercise capacity (5.7 versus 7.5; P < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment, CKD (69.4 versus 74.2; P = 0.003) and anemia (67.5 versus 73.6; P = 0.009) each remained associated with lower mean self-reported physical function. In addition, patients with CKD (6.3 versus 7.7; P < 0.001) or anemia (6.5 versus 7.4; P = 0.004) had lower adjusted mean exercise capacities. Participants with both CKD and anemia had lower self-reported physical function and exercise capacity than those with either alone. CKD and anemia are independently associated with physical limitation and reduced exercise capacity in outpatients with coronary disease, and these effects are additive. The broad impact of these disease conditions merits further study."

CD008691,0,15199443,0,Troponins in acute coronary syndromes.,"Delivering superior clinical specificity and sensitivity for myocardial necrosis, cardiac troponin has replaced creatine kinase-MB as the preferred biomarker for establishing the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. On the basis of expert recommendations, present convention sets the diagnostic decision-limit for each assay at the 99th percentile of troponin levels in an apparently healthy reference population. Owing to a lack of standardization between different assays, this level, corresponding to the 99th percentile, will vary depending upon the manufacturer. Among patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), even low-level elevations of cardiac troponin T or I are associated with higher risk of death and recurrent ischemic events compared with patients with a troponin level below the appropriate decision limit. Renal failure does not appear to diminish the prognostic value of troponins among patients with a high clinical probability of ACS. In addition, patients with elevated levels of troponin appear to gain the most benefit from more aggressive medical therapy with antithrombin and antiplatelet medications as well as an early invasive management strategy. Cardiac troponins offer extremely high tissue specificity but do not discriminate between ischemic and nonischemic mechanisms of myocardial injury; thus, presently the clinician must assess whether a patient's presenting symptoms are consistent with ACS. It is possible that future generations of troponin assays will detect specific post-translational modifications of troponins that may increase the analytic sensitivity for myocardial damage and offer insight into the timing and mechanism of myocardial injury."

CD008691,0,20491972,0,Malnutrition-inflammation-coronary calcification in pediatric patients receiving chronic hemodialysis.,"Malnutrition, inflammation, and renal osteodystrophy parameters with resultant coronary calcification (CC) are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in adults. Previous pediatric studies demonstrated CC in children but none assessed for an association between inflammation, malnutrition, renal osteodystrophy, and CC. To assess CC, ultrafast computerized tomogram was obtained for 16 pediatric patients (6 females; median age 17.2 years; range 9.1-21.2 years) receiving hemodialysis for >/=2 months. Inflammation was assessed by serum IL-6, IL-8, and C-reactive protein levels on the day of the computerized tomogram scan; nutrition parameters included serum albumin, cholesterol, the body mass index standard deviation score, and normalized protein catabolic rate. Renal osteodystrophy parameters included time-averaged serum calcium, phosphorus, total PTH, and calcitriol/calcium dose. Patients received hemodialysis thrice-weekly; mean single pool Kt/V 1.48+/-0.13; and mean normalized protein catabolic rate 1.27+/-0.17 g/kg/day. Five of 16 patients had CC. Patients with CC were older (19.1+/-2.1 vs. 15.4+/-3.1 months; P=0.03), had longer dialysis vintage (49.4+/-15.3 vs. 17.2+/-10.5 months, P=0.0002), lower serum cholesterol (122+/-17.7 vs. 160.4+/-10.6 mg/dL, P=0.02), and higher phosphorus (9.05+/-1.2 vs. 6.1+/-0.96 mg/dL, P=0.0001). Mean serum albumin and normalized protein catabolic rate did not differ for patients with CC. All patients had elevated IL-6 and IL-8 levels compared with healthy norms; the mean IL-6, IL-8, and C-reactive protein levels were not different in patients with CC. Coronary calcification was prevalent in older children receiving maintenance hemodialysis with a longer dialysis vintage. Worse renal osteodystrophy control and malnutrition (low cholesterol) may contribute to CC development."
CD008691,0,16293095,0,Dialysis patients and cardiovascular problems: can technology solve the complex equation?,"Patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis present higher mortality rates compared with the general population. Once patients are on hemodialysis, the risk of cardiovascular death is approximately 30-times higher than the general population, and still remains 10- to 20-times higher after stratification for age, gender and presence of diabetes. Approximately half of patient deaths on dialysis are attributed to cardiovascular causes, including coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease and heart failure. The cardiovascular burden of the hemodialysis patient arises from three different sources: risks inherent to the patient and the uremic syndrome, traditional risk factors and risk factors related to the dialysis therapy. Based on these considerations and the fact that several aspects of the dialysis procedure can cause either a cardiovascular burden or modify the burden already present, new technologies should be directed towards the approach of a possible 'cardioprotective dialysis therapy'. This approach may significantly contribute new techniques and new dialysis machines. Born to make dialysis easy and safe, the new machines feature several options that make monitoring and online hemodiafiltration a simple routine. These and other features could make dialysis better tolerated and more efficient in protecting from fatal cardiovascular events."

She had also been treated with a 10-year period of hemodialysis therapy for chronic renal failure. Her coronary angiography revealed the heavily calcified ectatic right coronary artery with a thrombus formation in its proximal portion associated with severe stenosis in the proximal left coronary artery. The left internal thoracic artery was anastomosed to #7 and the saphenous vein to #3, respectively. Postoperative coronary angiography performed one month later revealed both grafts to be patent with no stenosis. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is one of the major complication limiting the prognosis of the patient with SLE. We discuss the point related to cause of IHD and the surgical management."
CD008691,0,8418631,0,Cardiac and cerebrovascular disease in chronic uremia.,"Cardiovascular disease causes death in more than 40% of dialysis patients and the burden of its morbidity is high. The relationships between traditional risk factors for cardiac mortality, as identified by the Framingham study, and potential uremia-related risk factors are unclear. The characteristic echocardiographic pattern in dialysis patients is a dilated left ventricle with normal systolic function and left ventricular hypertrophy. Dilated cardiomyopathy, severe left ventricular hypertrophy, and coronary artery disease occur frequently and predispose to congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and ischemic heart disease. The risk factors that predispose to each disease and the natural history of each disorder have not been studied with sufficient precision. Few quality studies have been undertaken to identify the interventions that effectively ameliorate the impact of cardiac disease in dialysis patients. In some subsets of patients, erythropoietin or renal transplantation will be useful in inducing regression of some cardiac diseases.

CD008691,0,10977792,0,Prediction of coronary artery disease and cardiac events using electrocardiographic changes during hemodialysis.,"Hemodialysis (HD) patients have a high rate of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Both symptomatic and silent ischemic heart disease may occur frequently during HD because HD simultaneously reduces coronary artery oxygen delivery while increasing myocardial oxygen demand. The purpose of the present study is to prospectively evaluate the usefulness of a significant ST depression induced by HD for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) and as the predictor of subsequent cardiac events in HD patients. Sixty-one patients undergoing chronic HD (50 men, 11 women; mean age, 61 years) admitted for such cardiac symptoms as chest pain (n = 43), arrhythmia (n = 5), or heart failure (n = 13) were studied; 38 patients had CAD by coronary angiography. Electrocardiograms performed during HD showed an additional depression (>/=1.0 mV) of the ST segment in 18 patients (positive-ST group), but not in 43 patients (negative-ST group). The incidence of CAD was significantly greater in the former (100%) than in the latter group (46%). A prospective follow-up was performed for 21 +/- 2 months, and cardiac events occurred in all positive-ST group patients and in 21 negative-ST group patients. Event-free survival was poorer in the positive-ST group (P < 0.0001). A Cox proportional hazards model identified the significant ST depression as an independent risk factor for cardiac morbidity (P < 0.05), but not for all-cause mortality. ST depression during HD is useful to diagnose CAD in symptomatic patients and is considered an important prognosticator of subsequent cardiac events."

CD008691,0,8488402,0,Effect of hemodialysis on left ventricular contractility in pediatric patients with end-stage renal disease.,"Assessment of the effect of hemodialysis on myocardial contractility is complicated by variations in loading conditions that can occur during hemodialysis and by the prevalence of coronary artery disease among patients with chronic renal failure. Therefore, we used a load-independent index of left ventricular contractility, derived from analyses of the rate corrected velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (Vcfc)-end systolic wall stress (ESWS) relationship, to study the acute effects of hemodialysis on left ventricular function in the cases of 15 pediatric patients with end-stage renal disease. Prior to dialysis, Vcfc was appropriate for ESWS (102% +/- 16% of predicted) and did not differ significantly from values obtained from a group of nine normal control subjects of similar ages (103% +/- 9% of predicted), indicating that the patients' left ventricles were functioning in a normal inotropic state. After dialysis, Vcfc increased to levels beyond those expected for ESWS (118% +/- 20% of predicted, P < .05 versus control; P < .001 versus predialysis levels), indicating that dialysis was associated with enhancement of the left ventricle's inotropic state. A statistically significant increase in plasma norepinephrine levels was also observed. However, the increase in the percentage of the predicted Vcfc did not correlate with observed changes in this inotropic agent or with dialysis-induced variations in body weight or levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, or creatinine, and firm conclusions regarding the identity of the factors responsible for the positive inotropic effect of hemodialysis could not be drawn."

CD008691,0,19100414,0,"Apelin, a novel adipocytokine, in relation to endothelial function and inflammation in kidney allograft recipients.","Apelin, a newly discovered adipocytokine produced by white adipose tissue, is also expressed in kidney and heart. It has been reported that apelin is related to echocardiographic features in hemodialyzed patients. Cardiovascular disease is a major contributor to the mortality and morbidity among patients with chronic renal failure as well as kidney allograft recipients. The aim of this study was to assess the association between apelin and coronary artery disease (CAD) among kidney allograft recipients. We investigated plasma apelin levels in 100 clinically stable, kidney allograft recipients with versus without CAD. We also assessed markers of endothelial cell injury-von Villebrand factor (vWF), thrombomodulin, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), and CD146; markers of inflammation-high-sensitivity-reactive protein (hsCRP); other hemostatic parameters-tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and its inhibitor (PAI-1); as well as other adipocytokines-adiponectin and resistin-using commercially available kits. Markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation were significantly elevated among patients with CAD levels, as well as with CAD or diabetes, compared with those without CAD. Apelin was significantly lower among patients with CAD, but higher in diabetic patients. Apelin content was similar in hypertensive versus normotensive kidney allograft recipients. We observed significant correlations between apelin and ICAM, resistin, adiponectin, calcium, phosphate, alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels, with CAD or diabetes. Upon multiple regression analysis as well as CAD, adiponectin, and ICAM were predictors of apelin. Apelin was significantly reduced in kidney allograft recipients with CAD; its level was predicted by the presence of CAD, endothelial damage, or inflammation. Apelin and other adipocytokines may be associated with inflammation and its clinical consequences."

CD008691,0,16539621,0,Cardiac assessment for renal transplantation.,"Cardiac death is common in patients with end-stage renal failure. Screening for coronary artery disease prior to renal transplantation is advisable in high-risk patients. The optimal screening test has not been defined; however, myocardial perfusion studies are more sensitive than exercise electrocardiography and are less invasive than coronary angiography, which remains the gold standard. The management of coronary artery disease prior to transplantation is contentious. Revascularization of coronary artery stenoses is associated with high mortality and morbidity in the renal failure population, and there is little data to indicate that most patients with asymptomatic coronary lesions will benefit from prophylactic coronary intervention. In addition, beta-blockers and aspirin are under-utilized in the renal population. This paper reviews the literature and proposes algorithms for the cardiac assessment and management of patients prior to renal transplantation."

Twenty-five consecutive patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent routine SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All patients also underwent repeat MPI with a mobile SPECT unit which could be attached to a 64-slice MDCT system. Coronary CT angiography (cCTA) was performed without repositioning the patient. Investigational MPI was compared with routine MPI for detection of myocardial perfusion defects (PD). Two observers diagnosed presence or absence of CAD based on MPI alone, cCTA alone, and based on combined MPI and cCTA with fused image display. In 22/24 patients investigative MPI corresponded with routine MPI (r = 0.80). Stenosis >or= 50% at cCTA was detected in 6/24 patients. Six out of 24 patients had PD at regular MPI. Three of these six patients had no significant stenosis at cCTA. Three out of 19 patients with normal MPI studies had significant stenosis at cCTA.

CD008691,0,8784984,0,Regression of coronary atherosclerosis and amelioration of renal function during LDL-immunoadsorption therapy in a renal transplant recipient.,"Hyperlipoproteinemia is frequently observed in patients after renal transplantation and contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition, it was recently shown that hypercholesterolemia accelerates the progression of renal disease. In a renal transplant recipient (RTR) with severe coronary heart disease, familial hypercholesterolemia and decreased renal function, immunospecific LDL-apheresis was instituted since dietary restrictions failed to sufficiently improve hyperlipoproteinemia and medication had to be avoided due to drug interactions. Over a period of 36 months 145 LDL-apheresis treatments were performed at weekly intervals. The desorption of 5600 ml plasma volume allowed a mean reduction of total cholesterol by 56.6% (from 256 mg/dl to 110 mg/dl), of LDL-cholesterol by 63.0% (from 163 mg/dl to 58 mg/dl), of Lp(a) by 68.3% (from 34 mg/dl to 11 mg/dl) and of triglycerides by 49.6% (from 332 mg/dl to 163 mg/dl). Although temporarily decreasing during each apheresis session by 9.0%, HDL-cholesterol values increased during the first 9 months of treatment and remained within the normal range (> 45 mg/dl) thereafter. Cyclosporine A blood trough values were decreased by 32% during LDL-apheresis. Symptoms of angina pectoris rapidly improved and disappeared after 8 months of apheresis treatment. Initial coronary angiography exhibited serious three-vessel-disease, without the possibility of bypass grafting. Coronary angiography repeated after two years of therapy showed a regression of the disease. Serum creatinine levels declined during treatment (from 2.7 mg/dl to 1.8 mg/dl) and proteinuria did not increase further. This is the first report to show that long-term LDL-immunoadsorption is a safe and highly effective treatment of severe hyperlipidemia and coronary heart disease in a RTR, resulting in regression of vascular pathology. Moreover, amelioration of hyperlipidemia may have improved transplant function. Multicenter studies are necessary to confirm our results."

CD008691,0,16395255,0,Insulin resistance and impaired myocardial fatty acid metabolism in dialysis patients with normal coronary arteries.,"We investigated whether insulin resistance is associated with impaired cardiac fatty acid metabolism in maintenance hemodialysis patients without coronary artery disease. We studied 55 nondiabetic (63+/-11 years old) and 51 diabetic (61+/-10 years old) hemodialysis patients with normal coronary arteries, using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with an iodinated fatty acid analogue, iodine-123-beta-methyl iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid ((123)I-BMIPP), to evaluate cardiac fatty acid metabolism. SPECT imaging was graded regionally from 0 (normal) to 4 (absence of tracer) to calculate a summed score for 17 left ventricular segments. Insulin resistance was determined using the homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). HOMA-IR correlated with summed BMIPP score in nondiabetic and diabetic patients. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that HOMA-IR was independently associated with BMIPP summed score in nondiabetic (beta=0.774, t=9.218, P=0.0001) and diabetic patients (beta=0.792, t=9.079, P=0.0001). Left ventricular ejection fraction was lower in nondiabetic subjects with BMIPP summed score of at least 6 plus HOMA-IR of at least 4 than in others with lower values for both assessments (53.1+/-13.8%, n=20 vs 67.7+/-9.1%, n=23, P=0.0002); this was also true in diabetic subjects (50.9+/-15.2%, n=24 vs 71.0+/-13.6%, n=11, P=0.0007).

CD008691,0,10546140,0,[Bifurcation stenting of unprotected common trunk: a case report and review of the literature].,"Left main disease is the most severe form of atherosclerotic heart disease, with severe prognostic implications in the short-medium term. The traditional therapeutic approach has been surgical, with placement of bypass grafts both on the LAD and the circumflex artery. Published experience with the percutaneous approach to left main disease has been disappointing because of acute procedural problems and poor long-term outcome. On the other hand, a review of the literature shows a strong negative selection of patients offered PTCA of left main-stem lesions: most published series are composed of extremely high-risk patients, often in cardiogenic shock or with severe extracardiac multisystem disease, with a prohibitive surgical risk and an inherently poor acute and mid-term prognosis. We describe such a patient, a 77-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, who developed unstable angina due to distal critical left main disease, with involvement of the origin of both the LAD and the circumflex branch. Angina did not stabilize with medical therapy; the patient was denied surgery because of a prohibitively high surgical risk. A bifurcation stenting procedure was performed with no acute complications, a satisfactory one-month angiographic follow-up and no recurrence of angina until the death of the patient 4 months after the procedure for extracardiac reasons. As indicated by a recent paper by M. Leon, we likewise suggest that left main disease (especially in its simpler proximal variants) may actually be a good target for state-of-the-art transcatheter interventions, including primary stenting, under close angiographic follow-up and careful positive (instead of negative) selection of patients."

In a retrospective study we analyzed our clinical results of isolated CABG in 40 dialysis-dependent patients with ESRF (5 female and 35 male, mean age 65+/-8.4 years) and the use of extracorporeal circulation. The perioperative control group comprised 51 patients (10 female and 41 male, mean age 67+/-7.3 years) with normal renal function and isolated CABG. Demographic and preoperative data were comparable in both groups. Hospital mortality was 2.5% in patients with ESRF and 0% in patients with normal renal function. Morbidity was comparable in both groups. The mean number of grafts was 3.1+/-0.9 in the dialysis group and 2.9+/-0.8 in the control group.

CD008691,0,12822153,0,Percutaneous coronary intervention-associated nephropathy foreshadows increased risk of late adverse events in patients with normal baseline serum creatinine.,"In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, further decline in renal function (DRF) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is accompanied not only by adverse in-hospital events but also by increased risk of mortality and myocardial infarction at 1 year. This analysis was undertaken to determine if patients with normal renal function who develop DRF after PCI have a comparable increase in risk of death and myocardial infarction at 1 year, and whether this risk is independent of in-hospital complications (death, myocardial infarction, urgent coronary artery bypass grafting). We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients from a single center who underwent successful PCI with no major in-hospital complications who had pre-PCI serum creatinine (SCr) </= 1.2 mg/dl and no history of renal insufficiency. One-year follow-up was obtained by mail or telephone. There were 5,967 consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 208 (3.5%) developed DRF (an increase in SCr >/= 50% of baseline). They were more likely to be older, female, non-Caucasian, diabetic and/or hypertensive. They reported more prior cerebral or peripheral vascular events. They had undergone more complex PCI and were exposed to more radiographic contrast than the 96.5% who did not develop DRF. After adjustment for baseline variables, DRF remained an independent predictor of 1-year mortality, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization. In patients without prior renal impairment, DRF post-PCI is rare but is associated with an increased risk of late adverse cardiac events similar to that in chronic renal insufficiency patients."

During the study, ten patients reached the combined end point of overall mortality and/or CV event. Univariate factors associated with the combined end point were plasma N-BNP (P < 0.0005), creatinine (P < 0.002), systolic blood pressure (P < 0.009) and age (P < 0.015). N-BNP levels were higher in patients with CV events (P < 0.0005). Cox model regression analysis yielded log10 N-BNP (hazard ratio, 9.608; P < 0.007) and pre-existing CV disease (hazard ratio, 4.571; P < 0.029) as independent predictors of overall mortality or CV events. Kaplan-Meier analysis curves for the subgroup with supramedian creatinine levels (225 micromol/l) showed significant separation of the curves stratified for plasma N-BNP levels above and below the group median (291 pmol/l) for all end points. Receiver-operator-characteristic curves for N-BNP (355 pmol/l cut-off) demonstrated a specificity of 65.8% at a sensitivity of 100% for predicting CV events/overall mortality. The measurement of plasma N-BNP may aid in the risk stratification of pre-dialysis CKD patients. The high sensitivity and negative predictive value (100%) may enable the selection of patients who could safely be excluded from further investigations, resulting in better focusing of resources."
CD008691,0,16338257,0,The interaction of vascular inflammation and chronic kidney disease for the prediction of long-term death after percutaneous coronary intervention.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease frequently have worse outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to patients with normal renal function.

In addition to modifying traditional cardiovascular risk factors, therapy aimed at lowering serum phosphate and calcium-phosphate product has been advocated.

Covalent attachment of anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibodies to pre-formed liposomes stabilized with polyethylene glycol yielded ILs, with a coupling efficiency of the ICAM-1 to the liposomes of 10% to 24%. The anti-ICAM-1-labeled ILs had an average diameter of 136 nm as determined by dynamic light-scattering and cryogenic electron microscopy. The ILs' encapsulation of 5-[N-acetyl-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-amino)-N, N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodo-benzene-1,3-dicarboxamide (iohexol) was determined to be 18% to 19% by a dialysis technique coupled with ultraviolet detection of free iohexol. This encapsulation corresponded to 30 to 38 mg iodine per mL IL solution, and the ILs exhibited 91% to 98.5% iohexol retention at room temperature and under physiologic conditions. The specific binding of the ILs to cultured, activated HCAEC was measured using flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and fluorescence microscopy. The immunosorbent assays demonstrated the specificity of binding of anti-ICAM-1 to ICAM-1 compared with control studies using nonspecific immunoglobulin G-labeled ILs. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy experiments demonstrated the expression of ICAM-1 on the surface of activated HCAEC. Therefore, our iohexol-filled ILs demonstrated potential for implementation in computed tomographic angiography to noninvasively detect atherosclerotic plaques that are prone to rupture."

CD008691,0,10087474,0,[Clinical significance of improved persistent defect by thallium-201 reinjection imaging in the subacute phase of myocardial infarction].,"The clinical significance of new fill-in observed by thallium-201 (201Tl) reinjection in myocardial segments with persistent defect in the subacute phase of myocardial infarction was investigated. Seventy-five patients with subacute phase (mean 20th day) of first myocardial infarction underwent stress-redistribution-reinjection 201Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Percentage 201Tl uptake was calculated and classified as persistent defect without fill-in even after reinjection (PD group, n = 26, 35%), persistent defect with new fill-in after reinjection [REINJ (+) group, n = 19, 25%] and reversible defect [RD (+) group, n = 24, 32%]. The clinical features and angiographic findings were assessed in the same phase in each group. Diameter stenosis of the infarction-related arteries by coronary angiography was 68 +/- 34% in the PD group, 31 +/- 23% in the REINJ (+) group and 83 +/- 27% in the RD (+) group [p < 0.01, REINJ (+) group vs PD group and RD (+) group]. Wall motion of the infarcted myocardial segments significantly improved and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was higher in the REINJ (+) group than in the PD group (mean EF 51% vs 43%, p < 0.01). Post infarction angina was more frequent in the RD (+) group than in the REINJ (+) group (38% vs 5%, p < 0.05). Although new fill-in-after 201Tl reinjection has been considered to indicate severe myocardial ischemia in chronic coronary disease, these results indicate that this phenomenon in viable myocardium in patients with subacute phase of myocardial infarction is not always related to residual ischemia in the infarcted myocardial area."

CD008691,0,6506128,0,Pathogenesis of carotid bifurcation atherosclerosis in cynomolgus monkeys.,"We report here the effect of diet and social environment on the carotid bifurcation atherosclerosis of 60 adult male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) fed either an atherogenic diet (AD) or a more ""prudent"" diet (PD). Animals within each dietary condition lived either in unstable social groupings (which had their memberships reorganized on a regular basis) or in stable groupings. The experiment lasted 22 months, after which animals were necropsied and the extent of atherosclerosis was measured both at the carotid bifurcation and at other arterial sites. Carotid bifurcation atherosclerosis (CBA) was significantly more extensive and severe among animals fed the AD diet. Among these animals, all of which were normotensive, lesion extent was positively associated with both plasma cholesterol concentrations and heart rate response to behavioral stress, and negatively associated with the ability to clear glucose. No experimental variables correlated with the CBA of the PD animals; these lesions, some of which were extensive, were probably pre-existing. The social conditions and individual behavior patterns of the animals had no effect on CBA in either group, despite a pronounced effect on the coronary arteries (CA) of the same animals. While the overall correlation between CBA and CA atherosclerosis was not high, animals with extensive CBA almost always had extensive CA atherosclerosis. The factors influencing CBA in the cynomolgus monkey may be similar to those affecting humans."
CD008691,0,19644822,0,[Diabetes worsens the clinical manifestations and prognosis of concurrent cardiovascular and kidney disease].,"Numerous studies have shown a marked increase in the incidence of diabetes mellitus worldwide. Diabetes mellitus is currently considered equivalent to coronary artery disease in terms of prognostic risk stratification, and its high prevalence makes this clinical condition the first cause of end-stage renal disease requiring chronic hemodialysis or kidney transplant. Even if chronic kidney disease remains the ''Cinderella of the cardiovascular profile'', the presence of microalbuminuria is closely related to a high risk of development of coronary artery disease. The same risk factors that impair heart function are also harmful to the kidney, and the common pathophysiological features of the two systems are at the origin of a new subspecialty, cardionephrology. A crucial task of cardiologists and nephrologists is the early identification of high risk patients with concurrent cardiovascular and kidney disease. The utilization of simple screening methods such as assessment of microalbuminuria and glomerular filtration rate by family doctors may help in establishing prevention strategies directed towards cardiovascular risk and progression of kidney disease. In conclusion, early stratification of cardiovascular risk, coupled with primary prevention strategies aimed at the general population, is warranted to obtain a significant reduction of kidney and cardiovascular disease and of the need for chronic hemodialysis treatment. This strategy is safe and cost-effective in comparison with the costs of chronic dialysis of patients affected by chronic kidney disease."
CD008691,0,19129856,0,Frequency of renal artery stenosis and variants of renal vascularization in hypertensive patients: analysis of 1550 angiographies in one centre.,"Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is an important cause of arterial hypertension and chronic kidney disease. The aims of our study were to assess the prevalence of RAS and to examine the frequency of variants of renal vasculature, that is, multiple and/or accessory renal arteries in hypertensive patients referred to renal angiography. We evaluated retrospectively 1554 arteriographies of hypertensive patients. Angiograms were evaluated to find RAS, significant RAS (>60% stenosis of the lumen), radiological signs of atherosclerosis, aneurysms of the renal arteries or aorta and variants of kidney vascularization. The frequency of RAS including occlusions was 15.1% (21.3% of them were significant and suitable for revascularization). Variants of renal arterial vascularization were found in 26.5% of patients (multiple renal arteries-11.2% and accessory renal arteries-15.3%). Significant RAS was found more frequently in patients older than 60 years-OR 4.76 (2.08-10.86). Coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction or stroke significantly increased the chance of RAS detection. The frequency of renal accessory arteries was lower in patients older than 60 years and in patients with the radiological signs of atherosclerosis. Results of this study indicate that haemodynamically important RAS is found more frequently in hypertensive patients older than 60 years. Symptomatic atherosclerotic disease found in the peripheral and/or coronary arteries and diabetes mellitus increases the chance of RAS detection. Decreased occurrence of renal accessory arteries was found in hypertensive patients with radiological signs of atherosclerosis."
CD008691,0,8499068,0,Aortoiliac reconstruction in preparation for renal transplantation.,"Aortoiliac angiography has always been an integral part of the pretransplantation work-up of renal transplant candidates in Norway. The present study was undertaken to investigate the value of this routine. Based on the angiograms of approximately 1400 patients evaluated for renal transplantation during the 7-year period 1984-1991, 26 were found to have aortic and/or iliac atherosclerosis requiring pretransplant vascular reconstruction. Fifteen of the 26 patients had aneurysm of the abdominal aorta and 11 had extensive aortoiliac occlusive disease. A prosthetic graft was inserted in 25 patients and endarterectomy of the aortic bifurcation was performed in one. The cause of death was coronary heart disease in four of six patients who died before, and in one patient who died after, transplantation. Sixteen patients received a renal transplant while four patients are still on the waiting list. Fifteen of the recipients are alive, 14 with functioning renal transplants. The low yield of patients below 40 years of age requiring vascular reconstruction calls into question the routine use of angiographic investigation of renal transplant candidates below this age. However, we recommend this routine for the higher age groups because it often provides the surgeon performing the transplantation with valuable information. Aortoiliac reconstruction as preparation for renal transplantation is advocated when atherosclerosis of a degree that may preclude transplantation is found. Because of the high risk of myocardial infarction in these patients, one must be especially aware of coronary atherosclerosis when evaluating patients for this procedure."
CD008691,0,10630819,0,Current markers of myocardial ischemia and their validity in end-stage renal disease.,"Coronary artery disease is highly prevalent in patients with end-stage renal disease, and accounts for much of their observed morbidity and mortality. Despite this, diagnosing myocardial disease in this population remains problematic, because many patients present with abnormal baseline electrocardiograms, frequently compounded by silent or atypical symptoms. Conventionally used enzymatic markers of cardiac injury have not resolved this dilemma because of their poor specificity in end-stage renal disease. In particular, nonspecific elevations in creatinine kinase-muscle brain enzyme, a widely accepted marker of cardiac injury, have been consistently observed in the absence of other demonstrable evidence for cardiac injury. Recently, the cardiac troponins (troponin I and troponin T) have emerged as more sensitive markers for cardiac ischemia, facilitating rapid bedside diagnosis and early risk stratification. Unfortunately, cardiac troponin T shows poor specificity in end-stage renal disease, possibly because of variable expression in extracardiac tissues. On the other hand, troponin I consistently maintains a high sensitivity and specificity, and is the most sensitive marker for ischemic heart disease in this patient population."

We therefore determined the association between Lp(a) levels and the risk of clinical events of presumed atherosclerotic etiology in a prospective study of an outpatient hemodialysis population."
CD008691,0,15773630,0,Quantitative analysis of synchrotron radiation intravenous angiographic images.,"A medical research protocol on clinical intravenous coronary angiography has been completed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) biomedical beamline. The aim was to investigate the accuracy of intravenous coronary angiography based on the K-edge digital subtraction technique for the detection of in-stent restenosis. For each patient, diagnosis has been performed on the synchrotron radiation images and monitored with the conventional selective coronary angiography method taken as the golden standard. In this paper, the methods of image processing and the results of the quantitative analysis are described. Image processing includes beam harmonic contamination correction, spatial deconvolution and the extraction of a 'contrast' and a 'tissue' image from each couple of radiograms simultaneously acquired at energies bracketing the K-edge of iodine. Quantitative analysis includes the estimation of the vessel diameter, the calculation of the absolute iodine concentration profiles along the coronary arteries and the stenosis degree measurement."

The patients had mean age of 61.9 +/- 13.1 years, included 128 (69.6%) males, and were followed up for a mean period of 10.2 +/- 1.5 years. The mean duration of diabetes mellitus (DM) was 19.5 +/- 5.8 years, and duration of nephropathy was 7.7 +/- 3.3 years. Family history of DN was documented in 52 (28.2%) patients. At initial visit, the mean systolic blood pressure was 164 +/- 14.5 mmHg, the mean diastolic blood pressure was 97.9 +/- 10.4 mmHg. Thirty-seven (20%) patients had normal BMI, 88 (48%) were overweight, while 55 (30%) were obese. Mean creatinine clearance was 51.7 +/- 26.3 mL/min, 24 hrs urinary proteins 1.99 +/- 2.48 gm/day, HbA1C 9.2 +/- 1.8 %, triglyceride 2.1 +/- 1.3 mmol/L, and cholesterol 5.17 +/- 1.54 mmol/L. Diabetic complications included angiography proven coronary artery disease in 106 (57.6 %) patients, stroke in 21 (11.4%), myocardial infarction (MI) in 27(14.6%), angina in 87 (47.2 %), retinopathy in 82 (44.5%), Blindness in 3 (1.6%), peripheral vascular disease in 121 (65.7%), Neuropathy in 123 (66.8%), hypertension in178 (96.7%), diabetic foot in 25 (13.5%), Amputation in 10 (5.4%), and end-stage renal disease in 70 (38%). Total of 13 (7.05%) patients died in the hospital. Thirty-seven percent of patients developed > 6 concomitant complications. 28% developed 5, 17% developed 4, and the rest developed < 3. DN was relatively refractory to therapy and progressive; 123 (66.8%) patients doubled their serum creatinine in 3.59 +/- 2.88 years, 32 (17.3%) maintained stable renal function, 136 (73.6 %) deteriorated, and 12 (6.52%) improved. we conclude that the prevalence of diabetic complications is high among Saudi patients, and many had multiple complications. Baseline creatinine clearance and proteinuria, high systolic blood pressure, advanced age, and longer duration of diabetes were the most significant risk factors for developing complications."

CD008691,0,17884368,0,Comparison of the usefulness of gadodiamide and iodine mixture versus iodinated contrast alone for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing coronary angiography.,"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a common cause of hospital-acquired renal failure. Gadolinium-based contrast agents have been proposed as alternatives to iodinated contrast in patients at high risk for CIN. The use of high-dose intraarterial gadolinium chelates in the catheterization laboratory has been investigated in only a small number of patients. We compared patients with a creatinine clearance <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 who received intravenous hydration (> or =1,500 ml) and oral n-acetylcysteine prophylaxis with those who received a gadodiamide-iodine mixture (n = 90) or iodinated contrast alone (n = 79) in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. CIN was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dl in serum creatine from baseline. The 2 groups were similar with respect to demographics and risk factors. Although less iodinated contrast was used in the gadolinium mixture group, there was no difference in the incidence of CIN between the 2 groups. However, the initiation of dialysis (n = 7) and death (n = 8) only occurred in the diluted gadolinium contrast group. A stepdown multivariate analysis found diabetes mellitus to be the only independent predictor of CIN (p = 0.02, odds ratio 3.35, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 9.29, c-statistic 0.66). In conclusion, the incidence of CIN was not decreased in high-risk patients receiving a gadolinium-iodinated contrast mixture versus iodinated contrast alone."
CD008691,0,15743997,1,High prevalence of occult coronary artery stenosis in patients with chronic kidney disease at the initiation of renal replacement therapy: an angiographic examination.,"The prevalence of coronary artery stenosis (CAS) at the initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and no previous history of angina and/or myocardial infarction (MI) has not been fully elucidated. The prevalence of significant CAS was evaluated in 30 asymptomatic stage 5 CKD patients without a history of angina and/or MI by coronary angiography at the initiation of RRT. The correlations of various parameters with the prevalence of CAS were also examined. Atherosclerotic surrogate markers, including intima-media thickness of carotid artery and ankle-brachial BP index (ABI), were also evaluated. Significant CAS (>50% stenosis) was seen in 16 (53.3%) of 30 asymptomatic CKD patients on coronary angiography at the start of RRT. Stress cardiac scintigraphy was not effective for detecting hidden cardiac ischemia among the CKD patients. Univariate analysis showed that diabetes (P = 0.01), left ventricular mass index (P = 0.04), hyperlipidemia (P = 0.04), total cholesterol (P = 0.02), LDL cholesterol (P < 0.01), intima-media thickness (P = 0.04), and fibrinogen (P = 0.01) were positively correlated with the presence of CAS, whereas ABI (P < 0.01) showed a negative correlation with CAS. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that diabetes and fibrinogen were significant and independent risk factors for CAS in asymptomatic CKD patients who started RRT. The results clearly demonstrated that despite the absence of cardiac events, stage 5 CKD patients are already in a very high risk group for CAS at the initiation of RRT, which was also closely associated with a significant decrease in ABI."

CD008691,0,12410860,0,Cardiovascular calcification in patients with end-stage renal disease: a century-old phenomenon.,"The mortality risk from cardiovascular disease is increased in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This is due to both traditional and dialysis-specific factors. Recently, a number of the dialysis-specific risk factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular calcification. These include: hyperphosphatemia, high calcium-phosphate (Ca x P) product, elevated parathyroid hormone levels, duration of dialysis, and treatment with calcium-containing phosphate binders and vitamin D analogs. The recent availability of electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) has triggered increased awareness of the occurrence of cardiovascular calcification in ESRD patients. Given the development of transient hypercalcemia with calcium-containing binders, a link between calcium load from use of calcium-containing phosphate binders and development coronary calcification has been proposed. However, a causal relationship between use of these agents and cardiovascular calcification has not been established. Moreover, this phenomenon had been recognized over a century ago, long before these phosphate binders became available. Although its pathogenesis is likely to be multifactorial, available data strongly implicate elevated serum phosphorus as the primary culprit. Furthermore, the risk of calcification may be aggravated by vitamin D therapy, particularly in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, achieving vigorous control of serum phosphorus, Ca x P product and parathyroid hormone level might decrease cardiovascular calcification and improve survival of patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Since calcium acetate is the most cost-effective phosphate binder available, we recommend that it should remain the first line treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with ESRD."

CD008691,0,12538744,0,Prognostic value of myocardial perfusion studies in patients with end-stage renal disease assessed for kidney or kidney-pancreas transplantation: a meta-analysis.,"The prognostic utility of myocardial perfusion studies (MPS) such as thallium scintigraphy and dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) for stratifying cardiac risk among candidates for kidney or kidney-pancreas transplantation is uncertain. This study is a meta-analysis to determine the prognostic significance of MPS results on future myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac death (CD) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) assessed for kidney or kidney-pancreas transplantation. MEDLINE was searched using combinations of MeSH headings and text words for transplantation, coronary artery disease, prognosis, end-stage renal disease, and noninvasive cardiac testing (nuclear scintigraphy and DSE) for primary studies. Studies were included if they reported MPS results and cardiac events in patients assessed for kidney or kidney-pancreas transplantation. Methodologic study quality and outcome data were independently abstracted in duplicate by two researchers. The relative risks (RR) of MI and CD were calculated using a random effects model. Twelve articles met all inclusion criteria; 12 studies reported CD, and 9 reported MI. In eight studies, thallium scintigraphy was used (four with pharmacologic stress, four with exercise stress), whereas four used DSE. When compared with negative tests, positive tests had a significantly increased RR of MI (2.73 [95% CI, 1.25 to 5.97]; P = 0.01) and CD (2.92 [95% CI, 1.66 to 5.12]; P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses of studies of diabetic patients indicated that positive tests were associated with a RR of CD 3.95 (95% CI, 1.48 to 10.5; P = 0.006) and a RR of MI 2.68 (95% CI, 0.95 to 7.57; P = 0.06) when compared with negative tests. In studies evaluating mixed populations of diabetic and nondiabetic patients, positive tests were associated with a RR of CD 2.52 (95% CI, 1.25 to 5.08; P = 0.01) and with a RR of MI 2.79 (95% CI, 0.85 to 9.21; P = 0.09) when compared with a negative test. The presence of reversible defects was associated with an increased risk of MI in diabetic patients and of CD in both subgroups; fixed defects were associated with an increased risk of CD but not MI. It is concluded that positive MPS are useful in identifying patients with significantly increased risk of future MI and CD in both diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients."
CD008691,0,15877668,0,QTc dispersion in haemodialysis patients with cardiac complications.,"QTc dispersion (Maximum - Minimum QTc interval on a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)) is a useful predictor of tachyarrhythmic events and related sudden cardiac death. Recent studies have reported that QTc dispersion is prolonged in patients receiving haemodialysis (HD), and it is often further prolonged following HD treatment. In the present study, we examine whether the patients who are susceptible to prolongation of QTc dispersion by HD are prone to life-threatening cardiovascular events and related deaths."
