CD010438,0,4461416,0,Correction of the haemostatic defect in haemophiliacs without apparent correction of the coagulation defect.,"The evaluation of microhaematuria may be considered as a measure of the haemostatic defect of haemophiliacs in nonhaemorrhagic periods. In order to study the relationship between coagulation disorder and haemostatic defect we have administered small amounts (1 U and 3 U/kg) of AHG and of factor IX (1U/kg) to 12 haemophiliacs (20 A and 2 B) and we have examined the effects on coagulation and microhaematuria. Microhaematuria was determined by the measurement of urinary radioactivity/24 h, after infusion of autologous RBC labelled with 51-Cr, for 11 consecutive days (4 days before and 7 after the administration). Coagulation was investigated by thromboelastography, PTT, Quick's time, PCI, factor VIII and IX activity assays, fibrinogen assay, and euglobulin lysis time. During the period of investigation, the patients remained in bed. In controls, factor VIII administration did not affect microhaematuria. On the other hand, in all haemophiliacs, factor VIII and IX administration significantly reduced microhaematuria, although the administered dose was not able to modify the coagulation defect. In all subjects the reduction of microhaematuria lasted at least 5 days. The correction of the haemostatic defect, without improvement of the clotting disorder, and its persistence for several days suggest that factor VIII is involved in the composition of the vascular wall and in its functional integrity. Moreover, on the basis of these results it is possible to carry out a rational prophylaxis of the haemorrhagic episodes using small doses of factor VIII, be determining the duration of the correction of the haemostatic defect for each subject."

CD010438,0,16607076,0,The effect of N-acetylcysteine on blood coagulation and platelet function in patients undergoing open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may offer renal and hepatic protection during surgery, but in experimental studies it has been shown to impair coagulation. Since very little is known about the effects of NAC on blood coagulation in surgical patients, we studied its effects during abdominal aortic reconstruction. NAC (a bolus of 150 mg/kg followed by a continuous 24-h infusion of 150 mg/kg) or the same volume of placebo was given intravenously, in a randomized double-blinded fashion, to 20 patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The haematocrit, platelet count, prothrombin time, thromboelastometry, and platelet aggregation were studied during and after surgery. Total blood loss was also measured. The median (25th-75th percentiles) decrease of the prothrombin time value was 33.0% (30-37%) after NAC treatment and 6.5% (4-8%) after placebo (P<0.001). Postoperative prothrombin time values remained lower in the patients receiving NAC. In thromboelastometry tracings the coagulation time was more prolonged after the bolus of NAC (P=0.02). Platelet aggregation induced with adenosine diphosphate decreased after NAC but not after placebo. Low prothrombin time values before and after bolus infusions were associated with increased blood loss (P=0.008 and P=0.015, respectively). NAC has anticoagulant and platelet-inhibiting properties in patients undergoing major vascular surgery. This abnormal haemostatic activity should be considered when NAC is administered to patients with increased bleeding risk."

CD010438,0,7223223,0,[State of the clotting and anticoagulant systems of the blood in children with cerebrovascular insufficiency of congenital etiology].,"The author investigated the hemocoagulation system in 59 children with chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency caused by sequelae of natal inadequacy of the cervical division of the vertebral column and vertebral arteries. In children examined, pronounced thromboelastographic changes were noted. These changes pointed to a tendency to hypercoagulation combined with manifestations of hypocoagulation in the third phase of the blood clotting. This is an indication of activation of the secondary anticoagulation mechanism which plays a compensatory role in preventing intravascular thrombosis."
CD010438,0,21330915,0,"The influence of platelets, plasma and red blood cells on functional haemostatic assays.","Functional whole blood haemostatic assays are used increasingly to guide transfusion therapy and monitor medical treatment and are also applied for in-vitro evaluations of the haemostatic potential of stored platelets. We investigated how the cellular and plasmatic elements, both isolated and combined, influenced the two methodologically different assays, thrombelastography (TEG) and impedance aggregometry (Multiplate). Platelet-rich plasma (200 × 10/l) or pure plasma (0 platelets), with and without added red blood cells (RBCs), hematocrit 0, 0.15 or 0.29, were produced in vitro from platelet concentrates, fresh frozen plasma and stored RBC. Pure platelets were investigated by removing plasma components from platelet concentrates by diafiltration against the platelet storage solution Intersol. Plasma was readded by diafiltration against plasma in Intersol. Haemostatic function was evaluated by TEG and Multiplate. In the TEG, increasing amounts of RBC reduced clot strength and clot kinetics (α-angle), most markedly in plasma/RBC without platelets. In contrast, RBC in a platelet concentrate matrix enhanced Multiplate aggregation in response to weak agonists (ADP and arachidonic acid). Furthermore, removing plasma from platelet concentrates eliminated the TEG response and diminished the Multiplate aggregation response, but readding plasma to the pure platelet concentrates restored the response. Each of the elements in whole blood, plasma, platelets and RBC, affected the Multiplate and TEG results differently. The results emphasize that the concentrations of all cellular and plasmatic components in whole blood should be taken into account when interpreting results obtained by TEG and multiplate."

CD010438,0,6474360,0,Effect of continuous low-dose intravenous heparin administered during operation on postoperative measurements of antithrombin III and antifactor Xa.,"A preliminary subcutaneous dose of heparin given with premedication, followed by a continuous infusion of low-dose heparin up to 2 hours after operation, was given to 20 of 40 patients undergoing major abdominal operation randomly allocated to either act as controls or receive prophylaxis. The anticoagulant effect of heparin was determined by immunologic measurements of antithrombin III (AT III) and by assay of AT III and antifactor Xa activity on postoperative days 1 and 3. Despite lowered plasma AT III levels on postoperative day 3, the patients who had received low-dose heparin had significantly increased plasma antifactor Xa activity when compared with control patients (P less than 0.05). The incidences of thrombosis within 48 hours (early deep venous thrombosis) after operation were 9 of 20 control patients and 1 of 20 patients who received prophylaxis (P less than 0.01 by Fisher's exact test). Preoperative blood samples from another group of patients undergoing major abdominal operation were examined by the thromboelastograph saline dilution test, which has previously been shown to be a predictor of the risk of early deep vein thrombosis. The patients who were considered to be at high risk were treated with low-dose heparin as before, and the low-risk patients received no prophylaxis. The high-risk patients had lower levels of AT III before operation and before heparin administration than the low-risk patients and significantly lower levels on day 3 (P less than 0.02), whereas on day 3 the high-risk patients had significantly raised levels of plasma antifactor Xa. No patient in either group developed deep vein thrombosis within 48 hours of operation."

Its origin is multifactorial. Blood products transfusion associated with correction of coagulopathy are sometimes insufficient. We report two cases of massive bleeding after a Thoratec biventricular assistance implantation. After surgical haemostasis failure and despite the correction of coagulation disorders, a major bleeding persisted, so these patients received a single injection of 90 microg/kg of rFVIIa. This allowed in both cases a significant reduction of the bleeding and the restoration of normal haemodynamic conditions. This treatment was not complicated by any thrombotic accident."

CD010438,0,22688554,0,Predicting prothrombotic tendencies in sepsis using spatial clot growth dynamics.,"Inflammation in sepsis is associated with hypercoagulation that may lead to thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Conventional diagnostic assays are poorly sensitive to procoagulant changes in sepsis. Objectives of the article is to study changes in hemostatic state of septic patients using spatial clot growth assay (currently being developed under the trademark of thrombodynamics) and to compare the sensitivity of this method with the sensitivity of conventional methods. Sixteen patients with hematological malignancies and sepsis were enrolled in the study. All patients had been surveyed for a month following the infection onset. Spatial clot growth assay monitors fibrin clot development in a nonstirred thin layer of platelet-free plasma activated by immobilized tissue factor. Clotting time tests, thromboelastography, D-dimer assays were also performed. Spatial clot growth revealed hypercoagulation in six patients. D-dimer levels increase (with vein thrombosis in one case) was subsequently observed in five of them. D-dimer levels did not increase when spatial clot growth was normal. At the next time point, after spatial clot growth assay showed hypercoagulation, the mean D-dimer concentration was significantly higher than after a normal analysis (457 versus 234 μg/l; P < 0.05); there was no such correlation for other assays. The remaining 10 patients had elevated D-dimer levels on the first day; this either decreased gradually or remained elevated. Spatial clot growth showed normalization in survivors and growing hypocoagulation in nonsurvivors. Measuring spatial clot growth dynamics has potential diagnostic utility for the evaluation of thrombotic risk."
CD010438,0,1894197,0,Laboratory assays for the evaluation of recombinant hirudin.,"Several laboratory methods are available to measure the anticoagulant activity of recombinant hirudin (r-hirudin), a potent thrombin inhibitor. These assays include clot-based, amidolytic, immunologic and physicochemical techniques. Although r-hirudin, like heparin, is an effective anticoagulant, the mechanism of action of the two agents is different. Thus it is not surprising that the global tests, such as the prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and the Heptest (Haemachem, Inc., St. Louis, Mo., USA), do not show adequate responses to r-hirudin. In the range of 0.5-10.0 microgram/ml, where full anticoagulation is achieved, as determined by animal models of thrombosis, these assays show little to no prolongation of the time to clot. In order to find a more suitable assay system, modifications of the above assays were evaluated. The diluted APTT and diluted Heptest showed linear concentration-dependent responses to lower levels of r-hirudin with an enhanced sensitivity than that of the classical assays. On the other hand, the diluted thrombin time was too sensitive. Whole-blood clotting assays, ACT and thrombelastograph, effectively measured r-hirudin levels up to 25 micrograms/ml. The amidolytic anti-factor IIa assay, specific for evaluating direct thrombin inhibition, was very effective particularly when modified to decrease the sample:thrombin ratio. This assay may be useful in quality control since it is biochemically defined, and reagents are easily standardized. The relevance of the results of the anti-IIa assay to clinical conditions, however, remains to be determined. Thrombin generation assays have limited value in monitoring the anticoagulant effect of r-hirudin since the effect of thrombin inhibition by r-hirudin on coagulation feedback mechanisms, and thus the effect on thrombin generation, appears to be minimal. Immunologic methods such as ELISA and RIA are under development, but they may only be useful for the direct quantitation of absolute levels of r-hirudin and not for monitoring the clinical anticoagulant action. Furthermore, these assays are only sensitive to sub-microgram/ml levels. Therefore, thrombin-based clotting and amidolytic assays may at present be the best choice for evaluating the functional, clinical antithrombotic effects of r-hirudin."
CD010438,0,18777584,0,Experimental optimization of an in situ forming hydrogel for hemorrhage control.,"The fabrication of a novel in situ forming hydrogel composed of a multifunctional poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAA) was investigated. FTIR confirmed that PAA formed the hydrogel matrix (i.e., the formation of a PAA-like hydrogel). A factorial experiment was conducted to identify the key parameters that controlled gelation time, gel content, and swelling properties. The type of PEG (e.g., 4- and 6-arm) appeared to play a major role in determining all three performance parameters, with the greatest effect on gelation time. Other influencing factors include (a) the PEG concentration, which contributes to the gelation time and gel content; (b) pH of the buffer used for dissolving each polymer, which can affect the gelation time; and (c) PAA molecular weights, which contribute to the gel content and swelling. The concentration of PAA solution had no significant effects on hydrogel formation and properties within the investigated range, presumably due to negligible changes in the crosslinking density of the hydrogels. The PAA buffer pH influenced the gel content as well. Finally, thromboelastography was used to examine the effects of each polymer and their in situ gelation on blood coagulation in vitro. All individual polymers tested reduced clot strength, while the gelation of the polymers enhanced overall procoagulant effects. These results suggest that the biomaterial can be optimized to provide a combination of rapid gelation and swelling properties suitable for hemorrhage control and thus warrant further studies in animal bleeding models."
CD010438,0,3739331,0,Technical aspects of different donor plasmapheresis systems and biological results obtained in collected plasma.,"Four plasmapheresis systems were comparatively studied: a centrifugation system (Haemonetics Model 50) and three filtration ones (Dideco BT 810, Organon Teknika PLASMAPUR and HemaScience Autopheresis Plasmacell). For each separator we studied the technical conditions for plasma separation, the biological characteristics of the collected plasma and the in vitro recovery of factor VIIc after preparation of cryoprecipitates. Concerning the plasma extraction rate, the HemaScience apparatus was the most efficient but values were quite similar to those obtained with the Organon Teknika machine. Contaminating cells were only found in plasma separated with the Haemonetics. Total protein and immunoglobulin levels were higher in plasma collected with the Haemonetics and HaemaScience systems. Factor VIIIc activity was comparable in plasma separated by filtration or by centrifugation while fibrinopeptide A levels were higher in plasma collected by Haemonetics. Whatever the machine, no statistical difference was observed when in vitro recovery of factor VIII was studied."
CD010438,0,22983449,0,[Traumatic abruption of the placenta with disseminated intravascular coagulation].,Trauma in pregnancy is infrequent and a systematic primary strategy constitutes a real challenge for the interdisciplinary team. With a high fetal mortality rate and a substantial maternal mortality rate traumatic placental abruption is a severe emergency which every anesthetist should be aware of. After hemodynamic stabilization of the mother and control of the viability of the fetus the therapy of traumatic placental abruption consists mostly of an immediate caesarean section. Coagulopathy by depletion of coagulation factors as well as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) have to be expected and consequently a massive blood loss must be anticipated. Thrombelastography provides assistance for fast differential diagnosis and goal-directed treatment of the disturbed sections of the coagulation cascade.
CD010438,0,9614577,0,A chimeric fusion protein containing transforming growth factor-alpha mediates gene transfer via binding to the EGF receptor.,"Fusion proteins engineered to incorporate distinct functions which co-operate in mediating the cell-type specific uptake and intracellular delivery of DNA present an attractive approach for the development of self-assembling vector systems for targeted gene transfer. Here we have chosen the EGF receptor overexpressed in many human tumors of epithelial origin as a target for a novel modular fusion protein. We have fused a cDNA fragment of the human EGF receptor ligand TGF-alpha to sequences encoding the translocation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A as an endosome escape activity, and the DNA-binding domain of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor. Upon bacterial expression, this TEG fusion protein displayed specific binding to EGF receptors. Complexes of the chimeric protein and plasmid DNA carrying a luciferase reporter gene, after condensation with poly-L-lysine resulted in an up to 150-fold increase in reporter gene expression in EGF receptor expressing cells in comparison to poly-L-lysine-DNA complexes alone. While in COS-1 cells no additional endosome escape activity was required, in A431 cells gene delivery was dependent on the simultaneous presence of the endosome destabilizing reagent chloroquine indicating that cell-type specific factors such as different intracellular routing of protein-DNA complexes greatly influence transfection efficiency."
CD010438,0,8044318,0,Preoperative autologous plasmapheresis--9 years experience in orthopedic surgery.,"Since nine years preoperative autologous plasmapheresis (PPH) is an essential part of a comprehensive autologous transfusion program in the Rehabilitation Hospital/Orthopedic University Clinic of Ulm. After v. Finck's recommendation in 1984 we started plasma-predeposit by centrifugation-plasmapheresis (PCSR, Haemonetics Comp.) in all elective orthopedic-surgical patients expecting a blood loss > 1,000 ml. Primarily this procedure was used for intra- and postoperative hemostasis stabilization and for having the ideal component to recomplete the harvested red cells by the Cell SaverR to full blood units. By clinical experience the strategy of routinely combining plasma-predeposit and wound-blood salvaging instead of full blood- or red cell's-predeposit was recognized as not only being highly effective in saving of banked blood but furthermore as being the best way of getting free from all time related problems due to the limited preservation period of red cells because donated platelet poor plasma (PPP) can easily be frozen and stored up to one year at least. In addition there is one more decisive aspect in favour of autologous fresh frozen plasma (AFFP): it may be used for the best and most physiological kind of volume replacement. In combination with a short acting artificial plasma substitute (e.g. Polygelin) for intraoperative replacement AFFP is best suitable for reestablishing and maintaining postoperative normovolemia which is essential for any kind of hemodilution practicing like we routinely do when accepting low hemoglobin concentrations (> 7,0 g/dl) to avoid homologous blood transfusions and to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications at the same time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010438,0,8044317,0,[Does preoperative erythroapheresis avoid homologous transfusion?].,"The risk of transfusion-related viral infections promotes techniques intended to reduce such a risk. Preoperative erythroapheresis is an autologous blood collection technique which minimizes the inconvenience of repeated predeposit autologous donations. Erythroapheresis has been performed in 451 patients, 24 to 72 hours before surgery using a discontinuous flow cell separator (PCS+Haemonetics). The mean collected red cells volume was 485 ml (250-900) and was replaced by hydroxy-ethyl-starch (ELOHES). Homologous blood transfusion was avoided in 431 patients (95,6%). This technique is indicated for surgery with an expected blood loss between 1000 and 1500 ml or when the patient cannot be included in a preoperative blood donation programme. Preoperative erythrocytapheresis is a simple and well tolerated procedure. To have recourse to apheresis techniques allows to increase the number of autologous transfused patients."

A self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surface of tri(ethylene glycol) (TEG) and carboxyl group-terminated hexa(ethylene glycol) (HEG) was employed to suppress the nonspecific adsorption of plasma components onto the sensor surface. AFP was detected by a sandwich-type immunoassay using two kinds of antibodies, primary and secondary, in this system. The SPR signal shift was further enhanced by applying an antibody (polyclonal) against the second antibody. With this method, the SPR signals were highly intensified, and so nanogram levels (ng/ml) of AFP could be easily detected with a high signal/noise ratio, as is necessary for clinical diagnosis. It is expected that our SPR-based immunoassay method can also be applicable to the detection of several other tumor markers that are present in low concentrations in human blood."
CD010438,0,19002044,0,Rotational thromboelastography for monitoring of fibrinogen concentrate therapy in fibrinogen deficiency.,"To characterize a functional assay for circulating fibrinogen based on rotational thrombelastography. Maximum clot firmness was determined by rotational thrombelastography in normal human plasma pool, fibrinogen-deficient plasma pool, normal whole blood, and individual plasma samples from 17 patients with fibrinogen deficiency. Plasma samples spiked with varying concentrations of exogenous fibrinogen were also measured. Results were compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Clauss assay. The impact of sample freezing and filtration and use of cytochalasin D were also investigated. Over the tested range of 0-3 mg/ml added exogenous fibrinogen, the maximum clot firmness standard curve for determination of fibrinogen in plasma pools (n = 7) was linear (r2 = 0.97). Maximum clot firmness was highly linearly correlated both with Clauss assay (r2 = 0.93) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (r2 = 0.95). In unspiked plasma samples from individual patients with fibrinogen deficiency, fibrinogen was undetectable by rotational thromboelastography. By all evaluated methods, the response to spiking with fibrinogen in such samples coincided closely in patients with afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia. In dysfibrinogenemia, smaller Clauss assay responses to spiking were observed, whereas the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay response was variable. Maximum clot firmness was the only evaluated method of fibrinogen assessment to yield consistent results across all categories of fibrinogen deficiency. These in-vitro results suggest the potential clinical utility of rotational thromboelastography as a versatile method for monitoring the response to fibrinogen concentrate among patients with fibrinogen deficiency. Clinical investigations using rotational thromboelastography after in-vivo fibrinogen administration to patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiency are warranted."
CD010438,0,19002046,0,Argatroban enhances fibrinolysis by differential inhibition of thrombin-mediated activation of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor and factor XIII.,"Direct thrombin inhibitors enhance fibrinolysis more efficiently than heparin. Direct thrombin inhibitors and heparin enhance fibrinolysis by inhibition of activation of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI); however, the role played by other thrombin-activated proteins [e.g., factor XIII (FXIII)] in fibrinolysis remained to be elucidated. Our goal was thus to define the roles of TAFI and FXIII in direct thrombin inhibitor-mediated fibrinolysis enhancement. Plasma was exposed to argatroban or heparin, with coagulation initiated with kaolin/tissue factor and fibrinolysis initiated with tissue plasminogen activator. Additional experiments utilized TAFI and FXIII-deficient plasmas. Coagulation/fibrinolysis kinetics were monitored with thrombelastography. Argatroban (1.25, 2.5 microg/ml) significantly decreased clot lysis time and increased the maximum rate of lysis compared with unexposed plasma, whereas heparin exposure only diminished clot lysis time. When changes in maximum rate of lysis were related to changes in the maximum rate of thrombus generation, argatroban was associated with a greater increase in maximum rate of lysis per decrease in maximum rate of thrombus generation compared with heparin. Experiments with TAFI-deficient and FXIII-deficient plasma demonstrated a sparing of thrombin-mediated FXIII activation with concurrent inhibition of TAFI activation. The mechanism by which argatroban more efficiently enhanced fibrinolysis was via a differential inhibition of thrombin-mediated activation of TAFI and FXIII."
CD010438,0,11544618,0,A cytokine analysis of the effect of cell saver on blood in coronary bypass surgery.,"Increasing concern about the transmission of viral disease has generated greater interest in the use of salvaged blood as a means of alleviating the demand for homologous blood and expediting resuscitation during massive hemorrhage. Autologous blood processed by autotransfusion devices has become increasingly common in major surgery and is now largely viewed as safe and efficacious. However, there may be serious complications and sequelae associated with the use of processed blood, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and renal failure. Complement cascade activation resulting from blood coming into contact with autotransfusion equipment leads to enrollment of leukocytes and release of large concentrations of cytokines, which may contribute to the development of organ failure. Our study evaluated cytokine release during cell saver (CS) blood salvage in the course of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery."

Four stages in the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) were distinguished. Special attention is paid to the time course of the third stage with repeated hypercoagulation, suppressed fibrinolysis, and microthrombolysis in organs and tissues leading to multiple organ failure. The fourth stage of DIC is described, when involvement of the organs and generalized inflammation or sepsis is associated with remote (on days 3-5 and later) hemorrhages. These hemorrhages are apparently caused by disorders in fibrin production but not by acute fibrinolysis and consumption coagulopathy, as during the second stage of DIC."

CD010438,0,19109232,0,Successful treatment of canine hemophilia by continuous expression of canine FVIIa.,"Continuous expression of activated factor VII (FVIIa) via gene transfer is a potential therapeutic approach for hemophilia patients with or without inhibitory antibodies to human factor VIII (FVIII) or IX (FIX). Here, we investigate whether gene transfer of an engineered canine FVIIa (cFVIIa) transgene can affect hemostasis in a canine model of hemophilia, a good predictor of efficacy of hemophilia treatments. Purified recombinant cFVIIa exhibited 12-fold higher tissue factor-dependent activity than purified recombinant zymogen cFVII. Subsequently, we generated a serotype 8 recombinant adeno-associated viral vector expressing cFVIIa from a liver-specific promoter. Vector delivery via the portal vein in hemophilia A and B dogs was well tolerated, and long-term expression of cFVIIa resulted in a shortening of the prothrombin time, partial correction of the whole blood clotting time and thromboelastography parameters, and a complete absence of spontaneous bleeding episodes. No evidence of hepatotoxicity, thrombotic complications, or inhibitory immune response was found. These data provide the first evidence for in vivo efficacy and safety of continuously expressed FVIIa as a FVIII/FIX-bypassing agent in a large animal model of hemophilia, avoiding the risk of inhibitor formation associated with bolus FVIII or FIX infusion."

CD010438,0,19882085,0,Normal range values for thromboelastography in healthy adult volunteers.,"Thromboelastography (TEG) provides a functional evaluation of coagulation. It has characteristics of an ideal coagulation test for trauma, but is not frequently used, partially due to lack of both standardized techniques and normal values. We determined normal values for our population, compared them to those of the manufacturer and evaluated the effect of gender, age, blood type, and ethnicity. The technique was standardized using citrated blood, kaolin and was performed on a Haemoscope 5000 device. Volunteers were interviewed and excluded if pregnant, on anticoagulants or having a bleeding disorder. The TEG parameters analyzed were R, K, alpha, MA, LY30, and coagulation index. All volunteers outside the manufacturer's normal range underwent extensive coagulation investigations. Reference ranges for 95% for 118 healthy volunteers were R: 3.8-9.8 min, K: 0.7-3.4 min, alpha: 47.8-77.7 degrees, MA: 49.7-72.7 mm, LY30: -2.3-5.77%, coagulation index: -5.1-3.6. Most values were significantly different from those of the manufacturer, which would have diagnosed coagulopathy in 10 volunteers, for whom additional investigation revealed no disease (81% specificity). Healthy women were significantly more hypercoagulable than men. Aging was not associated with hypercoagulability and East Asian ethnicity was not with hypocoagulability. In our population, the manufacturer's normal values for citrated blood-kaolin had a specificity of 81% and would incorrectly identify 8.5% of the healthy volunteers as coagulopathic. This study supports the manufacturer's recommendation that each institution should determine its own normal values before adopting TEG, a procedure which may be impractical. Consideration should be given to a multi-institutional study to establish wide standard values for TEG."
CD010438,0,19491662,0,"Effects of acidosis, alkalosis, hyperthermia and hypothermia on haemostasis: results of point-of-care testing with the thromboelastography analyser.","In this study we assessed the effects of changes in pH, temperature, and their combination in whole blood on thromboelastographic variables. Blood was collected from six healthy volunteers. Thromboelastograph (TEG series 5000; Haemoscope Corporation, Illinois, USA) channels were set at temperatures of 32, 37, and 39 degrees C and each was filled with artificially acidified, alkalified, and neutral blood, respectively. Acidification (pH 6.95) significantly impairs thromboelastographic variables reaction time r (from 23.3 to 33.7 min; P = 0.0280), kinetic time k (from 8.7 to 16.1 min; P = 0.028), angle alpha (from 24.3 degrees to 13.8 degrees ; P = 0.028), prothrombin time (from 11.4 to 12.1 s; P = 0.044), and activated partial thromboplastin time (from 29.3 to 45.0 s; P = 0.028). A temperature drop from 37 to 32 degrees C in blood of neutral pH significantly impaired k (from 8.7 to 10.2 min; P = 0.028) and alpha (from 24.3 degrees to 21.0 degrees ; P = 0.027), whereas maximum amplitude ma significantly increased (from 46.5 to 52.5 mm; P = 0.027). A temperature rise from 37 to 39 degrees C at pH 7.37 did not affect any of the TEG variables. Artificial alkalization (pH 7.68) at a temperature of 37 degrees C had no effect on any of the measured variables. Acidosis causes a significant impairment of clot formation and clot strength. Hypothermia had the same effects, but to a lesser extent. These findings emphasize the need for correction of acidosis and hypothermia to normalize haemostasis."

Religious beliefs that preclude transfusion and the known risks of homologous blood have prompted investigators to seek alternatives to transfusion. We used the Haemonetics-V50 Cell Separator (Haemonetics Corporation) to provide for extracorporeal circulation of the patient's own blood with associated normovolemic hemodilution as a means of conserving blood during operations. This technique was used in eight patients undergoing extensive pelvic operations. The procedure was accepted by Jehovah's Witnesses and was well tolerated by all patients. Estimated blood loss ranged from 75 to 2,000 milliliters. One instance of mild intraoperative disseminated intravascular coagulation was encountered. Two patients were given homologous transfusions. While clinical judgment is necessary to determine the safety of complicated operations, this technique is useful in expanding surgical options for some patients who object to blood transfusion."

As monitored with a thrombelastograph, Ca(II) (0.5-2 mM) increases the rate of development and the maximum level of gel elastic modulus (G) of fibrin and protofibrin gels. Zn(II) (10-50 microM) decreases the elastic modulus of those gels, even in the presence of a large excess of Ca(II). This contrasts with the ability of both divalent cations to increase fibrin and protofibrin gel turbidity. Unlike the turbidity or fibre thickness of fibrin and protofibrin gels, both of which are increased by these cations, gel elasticity is increased by Ca(II) but decreased by Zn(II). It is demonstrated that Ca(II) and Zn(II) modulate fibrin and protofibrin gels independently of one another, and that they have opposing effects on the mechanical properties of the gels. The disparity between the visual (turbidity, TEM) and the mechanical (elasticity) properties of (proto)fibrin gels indicates the need for new conceptual and analytic paradigms."

Therefore, we evaluated the effects of milrinone on platelet number and function in cardiac surgical patients. Twenty-seven patients were studied during cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Patients were randomized to receive no milrinone (n = 10), or milrinone (n = 17) at a loading dose of 50-75 micrograms/kg in the CPB circuit followed by 0.5-0.75 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 12-24 h. Bleeding times and blood samples for coagulation studies were obtained prior to induction, and at 2 and 24 h after CPB. In both groups, platelet counts decreased significantly from the baseline at 2 and 24 h after CPB, and bleeding time increased significantly from the baseline at 2 and 24 h after CPB. No significant thromboelastoplasty (TEG) changes were observed in either group, and there were no significant differences in platelet aggregation or chest tube drainage between the groups. Acute milrinone administration did not cause significant changes in platelet number or function in patients undergoing cardiac operations requiring CPB, beyond the usual adverse effects of cardiac surgery and CPB."
CD010438,0,21068699,0,Comparison of thrombelastometry with simplified acute physiology score II and sequential organ failure assessment scores for the prediction of 30-day survival: a cohort study.,"Disseminated intravascular coagulation contributes to mortality of sepsis. The study was performed to investigate thromboelastometry as a potential predictor of 30-day survival in severe sepsis and to compare thromboelastometry to Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. Ninety-eight patients with severe sepsis were included in the cohort study. Thromboelastometry clotting time, clot formation time (CFT), maximum clot firmness (MCF), and α angle as well as SAPS II and SOFA scores were determined at the day of diagnosis. Thromboelastometry variables differed in survivors and nonsurvivors. Mean CFT was prolonged (276 ± 194 vs. 194 ± 109 s, P = 0.021; mean ± SD), and both MCF (52.7 ± 12.1 mm vs. 57.3 ± 11.5 mm, P = 0.042) and α angle (53.4 ± 12.8 degrees vs. 58.9 ± 11.8 degrees, P = 0.028) were reduced in nonsurvivors. Clotting time and SAPS II and SOFA scores were not different. Thromboelastometry values were classified as normal and pathological, respectively, using the median of the variables as the cutoff. Thromboelastometry values were normal if CFT was less than 185 s, MCF was greater than 55 mm, and α was greater than 57.5 degrees. Thirty-day survival was 85.7% when all thromboelastometry variables were normal, but 58.7% when at least one variable was pathological (P = 0.005). Multivariate analysis revealed that the absence or presence of at least one pathological thromboelastometry variable allows for better prediction of 30-day survival in severe sepsis than the SAPS II and SOFA scores (P = 0.01; odds ratio, 4.1), respectively, emphasizing the importance of the coagulation system in sepsis."
CD010438,0,1495183,0,[Thrombelastography as a bedside monitor of coagulation and fibrinolysis during surgery--a report of three cases].,"Three patients with abnormal hemostasis during surgery were reported. They were monitored by thrombelastography (TEG). The first case was a 48 year old male who underwent extravivo hepatectomy. TEG showed hypo-coagulability during anhepatic phase. After reperfusion to the liver, the coagulability determined by TEG returned to a normal pattern. The second patient was a 32 year old female who underwent laparotomy to stop bleeding for cervico-vaginal laceration after delivery. The patient had been in severe hemorrhagic shock, and massive blood transfusion and fluid administration were performed. TEG showed remarkable hypocoagulability probably due to blood dilution and consumption coagulopathy. When TEG returned to a normal pattern after administration of fresh frozen plasma and fresh whole blood, the abnormal bleeding stopped. The third patient was a 48 year old male who underwent resection of metastatic brain tumor. He had hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis. During surgery, abnormal bleeding was seen at surgical field, when TEG revealed remarkable hyper-fibrinolysis. After antifibrinolytic therapy coupled with replacement therapy, TEG returned to a normal pattern and the abnormal bleeding ceased. We conclude that TEG is a useful bed side monitor for the diagnosis of coagulopathy and hyper-fibrinolysis during surgery."

We used three mouse models to evaluate thrombosis risk associated with the FIX variant FIX-Triple, which has a 13-fold higher specific activity than wild-type FIX (FIX-WT). Protein infusion of FIX-Triple into haemophilia B mice was not thrombogenic, even at a dose of 13-fold higher than FIX-WT. Gene knock-in to generate mice that constitutively produce FIX-WT or FIX-Triple protein revealed that all mice expressed equal antigen levels. FIX-Triple knock-in mice that exhibited 10-fold higher FIX clotting activity did not show hypercoagulation. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) delivery of the FIX gene into mice was used to mimic gene therapy. Haemophilia B and inbred C57Bl/6 mice injected with different doses of virus particles carrying FIX-WT or FIX-Triple and expressing up to a nearly 13-fold excess (1289% of normal) of FIX clotting activity did not show increased risk of thrombosis compared with untreated wild-type mice in a normal haemostatic state. When challenged with ferric chloride (FeCl3), the mesenteric venules of AAV-treated C57Bl/6 mice that gave a nearly five-fold excess (474%) of FIX clotting activity were not thrombotic; however, thrombosis became obvious in FeCl3-challenged mice expressing extremely high FIX clotting activities (976-1289%) achieved by AAV delivery of FIX-Triple. These studies suggest that FIX-Triple is not thrombogenic at therapeutic levels and is a potential therapeutic substitute for FIX-WT."

The drug combinations tested with the SRCA were (1) cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-carboplatin (CACAR), (2) CAP, (3) carboquone-methotrexate-tegafur (CQ-MTX-TEG), (4) cisplatin-etoposide-hexamethyl-melamine (P-VP-HXM), and (5) bleomycin-epirubicin-cisplatin (BEP). A total of 132 patients (CAP, 69; SRCA, 63) were eligible for efficacy analysis based on relaparotomy findings. The overall response rate was 59% in the CAP arm and 62% in the SRCA arm. In the SRCA arm, 16 patients were treated with CACAR, 24 with CAP, 10 with CQ-MTX-TEG, 11 with P-VP-HXM, and 2 with BEP. The response rate to CACAR was 63% and to SRCA-CAP was 75%. The number of complete responses was higher when CAP was given as guided by the assay than when given at random (14/24 vs 23/69; P = 0.03, Pearson chi 2). Survival curves as estimated by Kaplan-Meier method gave a median survival of 24 (SE = 4) months to the SRCA arm and 28 (SE = 5) for the CAP arm (P = 0.7; log-rank test). Because no survival benefit was achieved, the SRCA obviously needs further development before it can be routinely recommended in the choice of first-line chemotherapy for patients with ovarian cancer."

The amount of blood loss was documented by haemoglobin measurements. No evidence of hypercoagulability was observed at around one hour into the operation in the absence of bleeding. We conclude that a mild to moderate degree of surgical blood loss with haemodilution is associated with the development of hypercoagulability as measured by thrombelastography. Further studies looking at the thrombebolic outcome in such groups of patients is warranted. It is also suggested that caution should be exercised in the use of intraoperative isovolaemic haemodilution until the phenomenon is further investigated."

According to the manufacturer's instructions for thromboelastography, patients were identified as showing evidence of fibrinolysis if after coming off bypass the Ly30 index was > or =7.5%. In the 20 fibrinolytic patients, fibrinolysis was readily corrected by tranexamic acid but these patients needed more colloid and more vasopressor support than the non-fibrinolytic patients. There were three deaths, all in the fibrinolytic patients. It is possible that fibrinolysis is a marker for onset of systemic inflammation syndrome. It is recommended that, until the association between fibrinolysis and worse outcome is investigated further, patients showing fibrinolysis early after cardiopulmonary bypass should not be discharged too soon from intensive care."
CD010438,0,16427376,0,High-dose recombinant factor VIIa therapy in hemophilia patients with inhibitors.,"Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; NovoSeven, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) is well established as an effective hemostatic agent for the management and prophylaxis of hemorrhage in hemophilia patients with inhibitors. Treatment schedules usually involve multiple bolus doses of 90 to 120 microg/kg administered every 2 to 3 hours, but recent evidence suggests that the use of higher doses might be justified. Such high-dose regimens may overcome the rapid clearance rate observed in pediatric patients, and may be more convenient for patients with poor venous access. It has been suggested that individually tailored high-dose therapies might be beneficial in selected groups of patients, although careful monitoring of such patients is advised. Thrombelastography has demonstrated considerable success in this regard, allowing accurate assessment of both hemostatic efficacy and individual response to rFVIIa. To date, no safety issues associated with high-dose rFVIIa have been identified. However, it is hoped that further research will support these favorable observations and thus contribute towards more effective dose optimization of rFVIIa in hemophilic inhibitor patients."

This pilot study was therefore designed to examine the effect of continuous wave (CW Nd: YAG) and pulsed wave (XeCl excimer) laser irradiation on whole blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in vitro using thromboelastography (TEG). TEG showed shortened reaction and coagulation times after three and six seconds with 10 W of continuous wave laser irradiation of 10 ml of blood. The clot formation rate and maximal amplitude were decreased with CW laser and the plasma clot lysis at one hour was significantly increased (P < 0.05). The effect of the pulsed wave laser was less pronounced. The exposure of whole blood to laser irradiation accelerated coagulation and enhanced fibrinolysis. The clinical significance of the findings is to be settled since the thrombogenicity of lasers is mainly caused by their effect on the vessel wall and thereby the on platelet-wall interaction."

Our study aimed to determine the impact of cyanosis and CHD on modified thrombelastography parameters, compared with children without CHD. Preoperative blood samples were taken for TEM analyses from a total of 51 infants scheduled for surgery. The following groups were examined: normal patients without CHD, acyanotic patients with acyanotic CHD, and cyanotic patients with CHD and with preoperative hemoglobin values higher than 15 g dl(-1). Mean values of all patient groups as well as all individual values of normal patients were within their normal ranges. Within these limits, however, clots were significantly inferior in cyanotic patients (worse mean values of eight out of 10 measured TEM parameters representing the intrinsic, extrinsic, and plasmatic pathways of coagulation) and in acyanotic patients (two out of 10 TEM parameters). Individually, pathological TEM parameters were found in seven (41%) cyanotic patients (P=0.003; vs. normal patients) and in three (17%) acyanotic patients (P=0.01). More than one abnormal TEM coagulation parameter was found in four patients, all of them cyanotic patients. Hyperfibrinolysis was detected in one patient, a cyanotic patient. The present investigation confirms previous findings that in patients with CHD the heart defect itself compromises coagulation monitored with TEM, but in addition, we demonstrate that cyanosis and/or polycythemia exert the essential negative impact on hemostasis. Preoperative hyperfibrinolysis detected with TEM seems to play no important role."
CD010438,0,18388501,0,The value of rotation thromboelastometry to monitor disturbed perioperative haemostasis and bleeding risk in patients with cardiopulmonary bypass.,"Rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM) performed on whole-blood samples provides information on the contribution of fibrinogen and platelets to clot formation. Such measurements are believed superior to classical plasma coagulation measurements as a means of monitoring disturbed haemostasis. On-pump cardiac surgery is associated with high bleeding risk. The study objective was to obtain information on the frequency of abnormal values of ROTEM variables and to assess their value in estimating bleeding risk in such patients. We studied 150 patients undergoing elective on-pump cardiac surgery. We found a significant surgery-induced decrease in haemostatic potential, with more abnormal ROTEM values in intrinsically activated coagulation (up to 50%) than in extrinsically activated coagulation (up to 27%) or the maximum clot firmness in FIBTEM (10%), a test measuring the contribution of fibrinogen. All ROTEM variables tend to normalize within 14-18 h postoperatively. Best positive predictive values and specificity for a postoperative blood loss above 600 ml were found for the clot formation time in extrinsically activated coagulation (71%/94%) and the maximum clot firmness in FIBTEM (73%/95%); these values were superior to the activated partial thromboplastin time or prothrombin time (56%/72% and 43%/5%, respectively). There was no relation between preoperative or early postoperative ROTEM values and intraoperative bleeding. ROTEM recorded a benefit of administration of platelet concentrates or fresh-frozen plasma, particularly when given postoperatively, on haemostasis. In contrast, intraoperative administration of red blood cells impaired haemostasis. ROTEM can provide a more detailed diagnostic basis enabling a focused therapy to cardiac surgery patients with high bleeding risk."
CD010438,0,21414427,0,Sequential co-immobilization of thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor on polyurethane: activation of protein C.,"In an effort to control the surface-mediated activation of thrombin and clot formation, proteins and molecules which mimic the anticoagulant properties of the vascular endothelial lining were immobilized on material surfaces. When immobilized on biomaterial surfaces, thrombomodulin (TM), an endothelial glycoprotein that binds thrombin and activates protein C (PC), was shown to generate activated PC (APC) and delay clot formation. However, TM-mediated activation of PC on biomaterial surfaces was shown to be limited by the transport of PC to the surface, with maximum activation obtained at a surface density of ∼40 fmole TM cm(-2). This work investigates surface immobilized with TM and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), a natural cofactor to TM which increases the rate of activation of PC on the native endothelium. A sequential and ordered immobilization of TM and EPCR on polyurethane at an enzymatically relevant distance (<10 nm) resulted in higher amounts of APC compared with surfaces with immobilized TM or with TM and EPCR immobilized randomly and at TM surface densities (1400 fmole cm(-2)) which were previously shown to be transport limited. Ordered TM and EPCR samples also showed increased time to clot formation in experiments with platelet-poor plasma, as measured by thromboelastography. Surfaces immobilized with TM and its natural cofactor EPCR at an enzymatically relevant distance are able to overcome transport limitations, increasing anticoagulant activation and time to clot formation."

It has been shown that the total amino acid pool increases more then two fold in hibernating animals with taurine accounting for about 50% of this increase [Storey et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1988; 85(21): 8350-4]. This work investigates the effect of taurine on platelets and the plasma coagulation system. Taurine was added at different concentrations in the range between 5 and 25 mM to donor plasma. Using STA/STA Compact coagulation analyzer the following tests were performed: prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and thrombin time (TT). At the highest concentration tested (25 mM) taurine prolonged TT by 9%. The prolongation was statistically significant but not clinically significant retaining TT within normal limits (16.7-20.7 s). PT and APTT remained unchanged by taurine. The effect of taurine on platelets was assessed by platelet aggregation by thrombin, extent of platelet shape change (ESC) induced by ADP, and thrombelastography. Taurine at 5 mM final concentration inhibited platelet aggregation by 10%. Increasing taurine concentration to 25 mM did not result in a further augmentation of the inhibitory effect. ESC was unaffected by taurine. Clot strength determined by thrombelastography also remained unchanged by taurine."

Bedside hemostasis monitors are needed urgently to assist clinicians in making the correct diagnosis in a timely manner."
CD010438,0,15502045,0,Electron microscopic evaluations of clot morphology during thrombelastography.,"In this study, we characterized clot morphology with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) at time points corresponding to the commonly used thrombelastography (TEG) variables, illustrating the correlation of the physical clot formation with TEG(R) tracings. The first channel of the TEG analyzer was used to obtain the tracings of clot formation, while the sub-samples for the SEM were obtained from the second TEG channel. Different types of samples were examined, including whole blood, abciximab-treated whole blood, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and abciximab-treated PRP. The SEM images were obtained at reaction time, different amplitudes (5-30 mm), maximum amplitude (MA), and at amplitude 60 min after MA. In the whole blood, coarse fibrin and activated platelets were observed at reaction time and fibrin strands progressively became more solid and intertwined at amplitude 10 mm and thereafter. Red blood cells were surrounded with fibrin strands at amplitude 30 mm and were tightly packed by fibrin strands at MA. In abciximab-treated whole blood, red blood cell shape was maintained at MA. The process of fibrin formation and platelet activation was also examined in PRP. Abciximab did not block platelet shape change, although the blockage of fibrin binding to platelets was shown on the TEG analyzer. In summary, we have shown structural changes of the forming clot in relation to TEG variables."

CD010438,0,15562073,0,A novel method to assess platelet inhibition by eptifibatide with thrombelastograph.,"We examined a novel method to detect platelet inhibition with thrombelastography (TEG). We hypothesized that this method would be suitable for monitoring the antiplatelet effects of eptifibatide (Integrilin). Whole blood from healthy volunteers was anticoagulated with 3.2% citrate or unfractionated heparin (7 IU/mL). For the platelet aggregation test, both citrate and heparinized samples were spiked with increasing concentrations of eptifibatide (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, and 4 microg/mL). Conventional kaolin TEG was performed with citrated samples, and batroxobin-modified TEG was performed with heparinized samples, which were spiked with eptifibatide at concentrations of 0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 4, 8, and 24 microg/mL. Adenosine 5'-diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation was reduced to 6.4% +/- 2.9% (citrate) and 10.3% +/- 4.8% (heparin) with eptifibatide at the concentration of 4 mug/mL. The kaolin TEG showed a decrease in maximum amplitude (MA) only at the eptifibatide concentration of 24 mug/mL and no change in alpha angle, whereas with the batroxobin-based TEG, the difference in MA and alpha angle was observed at concentrations >/=0.8 microg/mL. Additionally, the time to achieve maximum MA was much shorter for batroxobin TEG than for kaolin TEG. We conclude that the batroxobin-modified TEG is a sensitive method that detects platelet inhibition induced by eptifibatide."

CD010438,0,3781704,0,Recent advances of knowledge on the mechanism of action of drugs modifying the bronchial secretions.,"In order to explain the mechanism of action of drugs modifying the bronchial secretions, their subdivision into agents with a direct or an indirect action seems justified: the former primarily modify already formed secretions, whilst the latter act on the bronchial structures originating mucus. In hypersecretive states with increased viscoelasticity of mucus, a widespread therapy is represented by the use of direct reducing drugs, which act by breaking the mucofibrillar network. Among them the most important are those with free sulphydryl groups (-SH), which can break the disulphide bonds of the bronchial secretions. The mechanism of action of substances such as acetylcysteine and tiopronin, that are included in those with a direct reducing action, was already verified by researches with the modified thrombo-elastograph (MTE) and has been recently confirmed by the present authors by employing a simple biochemical method, by which the action of such drugs on the structure of serum IgM can be studied in vitro. The same method permits the classification of carbocisteine and letosteine as amongst the drugs with indirect action. From the results obtained by such in vitro experiences, the necessity to examine more closely the consequences of secondary effects which direct mucolytic agents may cause by modifying the rheological, biochemical and immunological properties of bronchial secretions has been demonstrated."

The patient, an 80-year-old woman, was admitted to the hospital for a massive subcutaneous hematoma, with severe anemia requiring red cell transfusion; a subsequent retroperitoneal hematoma developed 2 weeks later. Coagulation studies were normal except for a thromboelastographic pattern suggestive of FXIII deficiency. Clot solubility test was abnormal even after 1:1 mix with normal plasma. Immunochemical studies confirmed the presence of a monoclonal IgG lambda inhibitor directed against FXIII activity (type II FXIII inhibitor). The patient IgG fraction selectively inhibited FXIII transamidating activity but did not inhibit the thrombin-mediated activation of FXIII. The patient was treated with high doses of FXIII concentrate to overcome the inhibitor and immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide and discharged in good conditions. High doses of commercially available FXIII appear to be a safe and effective method of controlling acute episodes of bleeding in patients with acquired FXIII deficiency."
CD010438,0,21505720,0,Evaluation of a modified thromboelastography assay for the screening of von Willebrand disease.,"Thromboelastography (TEG) has been shown to be a valuable point-of-care device for the rapid diagnosis of various bleeding disorders. However, TEG has thus far not been used for the screening for von Willebrand disease (VWD). We evaluated the performance of a modified TEG assay for the laboratory screening of VWD. Three hundred twenty-eight patients (148 male, 180 female, median age 8.4 years, range 0.1 - 72.7 years) were included in the study. The diagnosis and classification of patients was based on personal and familial case history, von Willebrand factor antigen, ristocetin cofactor levels, collagen binding assay, factor VIII coagulant activity and multimer analysis. The ratio of clot strength after preincubation with ristocetin, and without ristocetin, represents the component of clot strength that is formed by cross-linked fibrin fibres and is dependent on the agglutinated platelet fraction. The decrease of the maximum amplitude is a function of the ristocetin concentration and provides a diagnostic parameter able to differentiate between healthy individuals and patients having VWD. Based on a preliminary cut-off value of 25% for the area under the curve (AUC) ratio, the sensitivity varied from 53% to 100% for the different VWD patient groups. The test is suitable for use as a screening test using whole blood and has the additional benefit of being suitable as a point of care test. It appears also useful for monitoring responses to desmopressin (DDAVP) and infusion therapy."
CD010438,0,10414779,0,Biochemical effects of some pesticides on lipid peroxidation and free-radical scavengers.,"Oxidative stress was studied in blood samples obtained from lindane, malathion and propoxur poisoning cases admitted to the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi and evaluated for lipid peroxidation, oxygen free radical (OFR) scavenging enzymes, and glutathione (GSH) and related enzymes. Acetylcholine esterase (AChE), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and GSH level were also assayed in lymphocytes. The level of thiobarbituric acid reacting substances and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase and GGT were increased and GSH level was decreased in pesticide poisoning. Apparently lindane (at the concentration examined) was more potent than malathion and propoxur in producing alteration in lipid peroxidation, GSH related parameters and OFR scavenging enzymes. However, AChE activity and GSH level in lymphocytes of malathion poisoning cases were reduced and GGT activity was enhanced in comparison to control subjects. The present results suggest that OFR scavenging enzymes were induced while combating oxidative stress in a differential manner in organochlorine, organophosphate and carbamate poisoning. Increased lipid peroxidation, coupled with altered levels of GSH and OFR scavenging enzymes in the blood are discussed in the light of oxidative stress."

CD010438,0,16387122,0,The effect of in vitro recombinant factor VIIA on coagulation parameters for blood taken during liver transplantation.,"Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been utilized in pilot studies in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) when administered to patients at doses of 68.37 microg/kg and 80 microg/kg. Although some effectiveness in normalizing measurements of coagulation has been demonstrated, the optimal dose for patients undergoing OLT has not been established. This study evaluated the effects of an in vitro equivalent dose of 120 microg/kg of rFVIIa on coagulation parameters when applied to the blood drawn from patients undergoing OLT. Coagulation function was assessed in 10 patients at four points during OLT. These time points were baseline, 5 minutes prior to reperfusion, 10 minutes after reperfusion, and 70 minutes after reperfusion. These patients did not receive rFVIIa perioperatively. At each of these four time points, a native sample was analyzed for prothrombin time (PT) and thromboelastogram. The rFVIIa (6.1 microg/kg or the approximate equivalent dose of 120 microg/kg for a 70 kg patient) was added to a second sample from the same patient. This second sample was also analyzed for PT and thromboelastogram. There was a statistically significant difference in baseline PT between native versus rFVIIa supplemented samples (15.8 +/- 3.21 vs 13.6 +/- 2.36 seconds, P < .02). The maximum amplitude of the thromboelastogram was larger in the native samples at 5 minutes prior to reperfusion (53.5 mm vs 39 mm, P < .02). No significant differences existed in the variables at any of the other sampling times. This study failed to demonstrate a consistent in vitro effect of rFVIIa on the blood taken from patients during OLT."
CD010438,0,578480,0,The influence of acetysalicylic acid on changes in platelet function due to physical exertion.,"The influence of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) on alterations of the platelets resulting from physical exertion was studied in 10 healthy volunteers. Before and 2 h after the administration of placebo or 1 g ASA, venous blood samples were taken for platelet counts, thrombelastography (TEG) and tests of ADP- and epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation. The blood in which the 2-h values were determined was sampled at the highest work-load during sub-maximum exercise on a bicycle ergometer (5 min each at 50, 100 and 150 watts). ASA had no effect on the alterations of the platelets due to physical effort: the increase in the first phase of epinephrine-induced aggregation, the elevation of the platelet count and the hypercoagulability demonstrable by TEG still persisted after the administration of ASA. Some effects were noted, however, that are also observed after the administration of ASA at rest: the second phase of epinephrine-induced aggregation was suppressed and disaggregation after induction with ADP was accelerated."

CD010438,0,10754382,0,The FVII activating protease cleaves single-chain plasminogen activators.,"A serine protease isolated from plasma sharing structural characteristics with a hepatocyte growth factor activator-like protease has been demonstrated recently to activate FVII. Accordingly, it was named 'FVII activator'. Until now an impact of this protease on the fibrinolytic system has not been reported. We islolated the protease from cryo-poor plasma by subsequent ion exchange chromatography and adsorption to immobilized heparin and/or aprotinin. Incubation of single-chain plasminogen activators (sc-PAs) with the FVII activator revealed significant activation of urokinase sc-PA (scu-PA) and tissue sc-PA (sct-PA) in vitro. It was enhanced in the presence of calcium and heparin. Compared to kallikrein, a more efficient activation of scu-PA was observed, whereas sct-PA appeared to be a poorer substrate for the FVI activator. At low protease concentrations and in the presence of heparin the scu-PA activation was comparable to plasmin. Employing recalcified whole blood thrombelastography, the lysis of initially formed fibrin was observed after addition of a combination of scu-PA and the FVII activator, whereas the scu-PA alone had a negligible effect at the concentration used. The study results as presented demonstrate that the FVII activator is a potent activator of sc-PAs in vitro. Whether it plays a physiological role in fibrinolysis deserves further investigation. Its comparatively high affinity to heparin assumes a function in cell surface or matrix events."

CD010438,0,14762869,0,Thromboelastogram monitoring in the perioperative period of hepatectomy for adult living liver donation.,"Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is becoming a widespread procedure. However, the risk of surgical and medical complications in healthy donors is still a major concern. Hypercoagulability contributes to thromboembolic complications after surgery, but alterations of hemostasis after liver resection are difficult to predict. This study aims to define the perioperative coagulation profile of living liver donors by the use of both routine tests and thromboelastogram (TEG). Ten subjects undergoing right hepatectomy for LDLT were studied. A complete coagulation screening was performed before operation. The coagulation profile was evaluated by platelet count, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and TEG at the beginning and at the end of surgery, and on days 1, 3, 5, and 10 after operation, while the donors were under low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis. At preoperative screening, no subject showed evidence of a prothrombotic state. In all cases, TEG was normal at the beginning of surgery. In the postoperative period, despite decreased platelet counts, increased PT-INR, and normal aPTT values, TEG evidenced the progressive development of hypercoagulability in 4 subjects on day 5 and in 6 subjects on day 10. One donor with a definitely hypercoagulable TEG on day 5 experienced deep venous thrombosis (DVT) on day 8, which was resolved with therapeutic doses of LMWH. In conclusion, despite routine tests suggesting hypocoagulability and LMWH prophylaxis, TEG monitoring showed the unexpected occurrence of hypercoagulability in the majority of the subjects after hepatectomy for LDLT. TEG monitoring could be useful in the perioperative management of donors to guide antithrombotic treatment and increase the safety of the procedure."

CD010438,0,17061631,0,The effect of excess protamine on thrombelastography in vitro.,"The aim of the current study was to assess the direct effect of protamine on conventional thrombelastography in vitro. Protamine was added to blood samples collected from 25 adult cardiac surgical patients prior to the induction of anaesthesia and after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. The final protamine concentrations were 0 (control), 0.05 mg/ml, 0.1 mg/ml and 0.2 mg/ml (i.e. sufficient to reverse heparin 0, 5, 10 and 20 IU/ml respectively, assuming a 1:1 reversal ratio). In the pre-induction samples, protamine was associated with increases in r time and reductions in maximum amplitude (P<0.01). After bypass, the control samples demonstrated a heparin effect as expected, which was corrected by the addition of protamine 0.05 mg/ml. However, the higher concentrations of protamine were again associated with increases in r time and reductions in maximum amplitude (P<0.01). The results indicate that protamine has a direct anticoagulant effect on conventional thrombelastography in vitro. This effect occurs whether protamine is present alone, or whether protamine is present in excess after neutralization of heparin. Unless this effect is taken into account, excess protamine may confound the interpretation of conventional thrombelastography in cardiac surgical patients."

CD010438,0,9556230,0,"Production of a recombinant antithrombotic and fibrinolytic protein, PLATSAK, in Escherichia coli.","The three main components involved in thrombosis and haemostasis are thrombin, platelets, and plasmin. Almost all inhibitors of thrombosis are focused either on the inhibition of thrombin or on the inhibition of platelets. We designed a construct using the fibrinolytic activity of staphylokinase, fused via a cleavable linker to an antithrombotic peptide of 29 amino acids. The peptide was designed to include three inhibitory regions: (1) the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) amino acid sequence to prevent fibrinogen binding to platelets; (2) a part of fibrinopeptide A, an inhibitor of thrombin; and (3) the tail of hirudin, a potent direct antithrombin. The amino acid sequence of the 29 amino acid peptide was reverse translated, and the gene was chemically synthesised and cloned into an expression vector as a 3' fusion to the staphylokinase gene. Gene expression was induced in E. coli Top 10 cells and the fusion protein, designated PLATSAK, was purified using metal affinity chromatography. The purified fusion protein significantly lengthened the activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time and inhibited the amidolytic activity of thrombin. The fibrinolytic activity was almost equal to that of recombinant staphylokinase as measured with a thrombelastograph. Platelet aggregation was not markedly inhibited by PLATSAK, probably due to the unfavourable three dimensional structure, with the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence buried inside. Our results confirm that it is feasible to design and produce a hybrid multifunctional protein that targets various components of the haemostatic process."

Recently it was reported that plasminogen activator inhibitor type one (PAI-1) inactivation can alleviate the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and reduce the body weight of obese individuals. In our broad search for natural compounds and their derivatives that can inhibit PAI-1, we include the polyphenols of teas since teas (green and black) or their components have been reported to alleviate the symptoms of both obesity and Alzheimer's disease. Inactivation of PAI-1 was measured in human plasma using thromboelastography. We used known PAI-1 inhibitor PAI039 [{1-benzyl-5-[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl]-1H-indol-3-yl}(oxo)acetic acid] as a positive control and (-)-epigallo-catechin-3-gallate (EGCG), its prodrug octaacetate EGCG (OcAc EGCG) and theaflavin digallate [TH(2)] as potential PAI-1 inhibitors. We found that inactivation of PAI-1 in plasma by EGCG and OcAc EGCG was low or very low. However, TH(2) inactivated PAI-1 in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 18 microM which is equal to or better than the IC50 reported for known PAI-1 inhibitor PAI039. Clearly TH(2) inhibits PAI-1 and might play a role in slowing down the progression of Alzheimer's disease or obesity by a PAI-1-dependent pathway. While the clinical value of TH(2) has not been proven, long-term prospective studies assessing its efficacy are warranted due to the benign nature of the substance."

CD010438,0,21543036,0,Coagulation status in patients with coronary artery disease taking 100 mg aspirin and healthy volunteers using PFA-100® and ROTEM®.,"Previous investigation revealed that age is a major risk factor for thomboembolic events. Earlier studies with thrombelastography have demonstrated procoagulant activity in elderly patients with coronary artery disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate age-related differences in the coagulation status of patients with documented coronary artery disease, healthy elderly and healthy young volunteers with the rotation thrombelastography (ROTEM®) and PFA-100®. Measured with ROTEM®, mean clot formation time (CFT (EXTEM)) in healthy young volunteers (120.8 ± 73.5 s) was significantly longer than in healthy elderly (78.3 ± 36.7 s, p < 0.05) and in patients with coronary artery disease (74.3 ± 59.1 s, p < 0.05). No difference was found between healthy elderly and patients with coronary artery disease. The lowest value for mean maximum clot formation (MCF (EXTEM)) was seen in healthy young volunteers (57.0 ± 6.1 mm) which was significantly different to healthy elderly (61.9 ± 4.8 mm, p < 0.05) and patients with coronary artery disease (65.3 ± 8.4 mm, p < 0.05). No difference could be found between healthy elderly and patients with coronary artery disease, although a trend to higher mean MCF (EXTEM) and lower mean CFT (EXTEM)in patients with coronary artery disease was found. Measured with the collagen/epinephrine cartridge of the PFA-100®, healthy young volunteers (166.4 ± 59.5 s) had numerical but insignificantly longer mean closure times compared to healthy elderly (138.5 ± 53.3 s). These findings point to agerelated differences in thrombelastographic parameters. The ROTEM® analysis indicates an increased coagulability in patients with coronary artery disease and healthy elderly compared to healthy young volunteers."

CD010438,0,12505922,0,The predictive value of modified computerized thromboelastography and platelet function analysis for postoperative blood loss in routine cardiac surgery.,"Hemorrhage after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) remains a clinical problem. Point-of-care tests to identify hemostatic disturbances at the bedside are desirable. In the present study, we evaluated the predictive value of two point-of-care tests on postoperative bleeding after routine cardiac surgery. Prospectively, 255 consecutive patients were studied to compare the ability of modified thromboelastography (ROTEG) as well as a platelet function analyzer (PFA-100) to predict postoperative blood loss. Measurements were performed at three time points: preoperatively, during CPB, and after protamine administration with three modified thromboelastography and PFA tests. The best predictors of increased bleeding tendency were the tests performed after CPB. The angle alpha is the best predictor (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.69) and, in combination with the adenosine diphosphate-PFA test, the predictive accuracy is enhanced (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.73). The negative predictive value for the angle alpha is 82%, although the positive predictive value is small (41%). Thromboelastography is a better predictor than PFA. In routine cardiac surgery, impaired hemostasis as identified by point-of-care tests does not inevitably lead to hemorrhage postoperatively. However, patients with normal test results are unlikely to bleed for hemostatic reasons. Bleeding in these patients is probably caused surgically. The high negative predictive value supports early identification and targeted treatment of surgical bleeding by distinguishing it from a significant coagulopathy."

The anaesthetic management of a pregnant patient within six weeks of an ischaemic cerebrovascular event has not previously been reported. Issues raised include consent and minimising further neurological insult. Changes in regional blood flow, cerebral metabolic rate and integrity of the blood brain barrier must be considered although evidence to support regional in preference to general anaesthesia is lacking. We report the case of a woman with known systemic lupus erythematosis and antiphospholipid syndrome who developed idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in pregnancy and suffered a thrombotic cerebral vascular accident at 32 weeks of gestation. Ten days later she required urgent caesarean delivery, which was performed under general anaesthesia. There was no deterioration in neurological function following surgery and eight days postoperatively she was transferred to a neuro-rehabilitation centre for further care. The idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura did not respond to medical therapy following delivery and a second anaesthetic was required for splenectomy four weeks later."
CD010438,0,19856870,0,[Thromboelastometry--a new method supporting the therapeutical decisions in the coagulopathy based on the Hartet's thromboelastography].,"Thromboelastometry is a diagnostic method presenting in graphs and numbers the dynamics of hemostasis and physical properties of the clot forming. Thromboelastometry allows quick and complete assessment of clotting and fibrinolysis mechanism respecting share of coagulation and fibrinolytic factors and also platelets. Interpretation is based on comparative analysis of model data from computer memory with graphs and numeric data that present clot formation and fibrinolysis in time periods. Graphic presentation of quality and dynamics of coagulation process allow to understand its disorders caused for different reasons, like coagulation factors deficiency, thrombocytopenia, massive bleeding and transfusion or sometimes hypothermia. Measuring device used for thromboelastometry is mobile and makes possible to test blood by a patient bed. By introducing specialist reagents that activate clotting in vitro it is possible to shorten the diagnostic period to 15 minutes therefore multiple patient hemostasis controls can be achieved in real time. Quick diagnostic and possibility of assessment an influence of applied treatment on coagulation process allow to make proper therapeutic decisions in patients with coagulopathy. Hemostasis image and reference to clinical situation might be helpful in diagnosis if there is a surgical bleeding or there is a bleeding released by coagulation and fibrinolytic disorders. Thromboelastometry contributes not only to widen knowledge about complex mechanics of coagulation disorders but also to reduce usage of blood and its products. Thromboelastograhic examinations play a major role in the documentation of coagulation disorders treatment. In order to widen use of this method in clinical practice the algorithms are created, based on thromboelastometry and thromboelatograhy results. These can indicate type and quantity of blood products and medicines that are necessary to administer. Thromboelastometry is applied in many medical disciplines like cardiothoracic surgery, transplant surgery, obstetrics, multiorgan failures, vascular surgery and intensive care. In this method specialistic laboratory education is unnecessary."
CD010438,0,22097979,0,A method for anticoagulation of children on mechanical circulatory support.,"Anticoagulation of children on mechanical circulatory support presents a challenge. We implanted 28 devices in children and infants using a consistent anticoagulation protocol. We performed a retrospective review of all children implanted in our program with mechanical assist devices since 1997. Heparin, dipyridamole, and aspirin were used for anticoagulation and antiaggregation. Coagulation monitoring included thromboelastography (TEG), platelet aggregration studies, international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count. Twenty-eight children, ages 1 month to 16 years (mean 5.3; median 2.4 years), were implanted for 3-107 days (mean 27; median 17). Eighteen received left ventricular assist devices, seven received biventricular assist devices, and three received total artificial hearts. Adverse events during the 720 days of device support included the following: six (21%) reoperations for bleeding; seven strokes (25%): two fatal, two with a mild residual deficit, and three without deficit; and three (11%) visceral emboli: two fatal and one nonfatal. There were eight deaths (29%). Causes of death were embolic (four), graft failure post-transplantation (one), preimplant anoxic brain damage (two), and postexplant heart failure (one). 24/28 (86%) survived to transplantation or weaning from device and 20/28 (71%) were discharged from the hospital, 10 after transplantation and 10 after native heart recovery. All 20 early survivors survived long term. We describe an anticoagulation protocol based upon TEG and platelet aggregation studies and using heparin, aspirin, and dipyridamole. Adequate anticoagulation is more difficult in children. However, 71% of the patients in our study survived long term."

Based on literature and own observations.,"By means of a haemonetics 30 cell separator platelets were collected for transfusion purposes from 18 different blood donors. A median yield of 5.7 X 10(11) platelets was obtained. The yield of platelets was found to be linearly related to the donors' initial platelet counts. The procedures were standardized by using one size of bowl (225 ml), performing 10 cycles per procedure, and performing all cycles as uniformly as possible. The median time per procedure was 118 min. Mild donor reactions were seen in 8 donors (44%) consisting of circumoral tingling. The decrement in the donors' platelet count was 86 X 10(9)/1, 37% of the initial platelet counts. The choice of the bowl size of 225 ml is motivated. The absurdity of the expression of yield pe h of processing, and of yield per 1 of blood processed is discussed. Furthermore, it is shown, that neither the fall in haematocrit nor the fall in the platelet count during the procedure are linear. The formulas commonly used for calculating the blood volume and platelet extraction efficiency, which are based on these assumptions, cannot therefore, in our opinion, be used."

Using a Haemonetics V-50 or a Baxter CS-3000, 374 PBSC-aphereses were performed with a median of six aphereses per patient. The median number of PBSC (CFU-GM) retransfused in 22 patients who received PBSC for hematological reconstitution only was 3.26 x 10(4)/kg. For 22 patients who received autologous bone marrow plus BPSC, the median number of retransfused PBSC was 2.14 x 10(4)/kg. Myeloid engraftment was achieved in all patients, but megakaryopoiesis was delayed when the number of PBSC was less than 5.0 x 10(4)/kg. The results demonstrate that harvesting of a sufficient number of PBSC after chemotherapy is feasible but further measures like the use of rh GM-CSF will be necessary to reduce apheresis procedures and to obtain high yields to ensure rapid and complete engraftment."
CD010438,0,8111053,0,Erythrocytapheresis therapy to reduce iron overload in chronically transfused patients with sickle cell disease.,"Chelation therapy with deferoxamine is effective in preventing the risk of transfusional iron overload, but treatment failure is common because of noncompliance. To reduce the transfusional iron load, we have evaluated longterm erythrocytapheresis in 14 subjects with sickle cell disease and stroke (11) or other complications (3) as an alternative to simple transfusion. Subjects were treated with erythrocytapheresis using the Haemonetics V50 (Haemonetics Corp, Braintree, MA) to maintain the target pretransfusion hemoglobin S (Hb S) level less than 50% for 6 to 71 months. The transfusional iron load and the donor blood usage were analyzed for a 6- to 36-month study period and were compared with similar data from a subset of 7 subjects previously treated with conventional (target Hb S < 30%) and modified (target Hb S < 50%) simple transfusion protocols. The effect of erythrocytapheresis on iron accumulation was determined by assessment of serum ferritin levels in the absence of iron chelation. The mean transfusional iron load and donor blood usage with erythrocytapheresis were 19 +/- 14 mg iron/kg/yr (range, 6 to 50) and 188.4 +/- 55.2 mL packed-red blood cells (RBC)/kg/yr (range, 107 to 281), respectively. Of 6 subjects receiving no iron chelation therapy, 5 maintained normal or nearly normal serum ferritin levels during 11 to 36 months of erythrocytapheresis. In comparison with conventional simple transfusion and modified simple transfusion, erythrocytapheresis reduced iron loading by 87% (P < .01) and 82% (P < .01), respectively, but increased donor blood usage by 23% and 73%, respectively. Subjects with pre-erythrocytapheresis Hb levels > or = 8.0 g/dL had lower iron accumulation (P < .001) and less donor blood usage (P < .005) than subjects with Hb levels < or = 8.0 g/dL. Although donor blood usage is increased in comparison with simple transfusion, long-term erythrocytapheresis markedly reduces or prevents iron accumulation. This form of transfusion therapy allows the cessation of iron chelation in well-chelated subjects and, if used as the initial form of transfusion therapy, may prevent long-term complications of sickle cell disease without risk of iron overload and the need for chelation therapy."
CD010438,0,3196810,0,Fibrin elasticity and coagulation.,"Sudden increase of viscosity in former times indicated the start of coagulation. Yet its measurement destroyed the structure of coagulum. By the precursor method of thrombelastography the author 1944 found elasticity to be the essential physiological property of coagulum. In the production of elastic fibrin structure its early phase is the most efficient in this respect. The speed of prime structure formation is extremely fast in presence of enough phospholipid as well as of plasma factor XIII. Even high amounts of thrombin cannot replace one or both of these substances indispensable to grow rapidly a perfect fibrin web. This phase yet does not become effective if it is not accompanied by the orbital micro-flow of the new orbitometry method. Its shear is comparable to that in a coronary artery. The special resonance effect of the method in combination with the early phase of fibrin production is generating some kind of a physiological feed back: increasing fibrin will strengthen shear stress as long as less platelets are entangled which will reduce the elastic flexibility of fibrin web. Some kind of a ""coagulation spin effect"" in optimal combination of shear stress, phospholipid and factorXIII, will extremely fast originate a firm fibrin structure, a mechanism which may be of significance for a fast occlusion of arterial stenoses."
CD010438,0,21330940,1,Neuroprotective effects of 17β-estradiol after hypovolemic cardiac arrest in immature piglets: the role of nitric oxide and peroxidation.,"We recently reported that cerebral and cardiac injuries are mitigated in immature female piglets after severe hemorrhage with subsequent cardiac arrest. Female sex was also associated with a smaller increase in the cerebral expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that exogenously administered 17β-estradiol (E₂) can improve neurological outcome by NOS modulation. Thirty-nine sexually immature piglets were bled to a mean arterial pressure of 35 mmHg over 15 min. Fifty micrograms per kilogram of E₂ was then administered to 10 male and 10 female animals (estradiol group), whereas control animals (n = 10 males and 9 females) received equal volume of normal saline. The animals were then subjected to ventricular fibrillation (4 min) followed by up to 15 min of open-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Vasopressin 0.4 U · kg⁻¹ and amiodarone 0.5 mg · kg⁻¹ were given, and 3 mL · kg⁻¹ of 7.5% saline with 6% dextran was administered over 20 min. All surviving animals were killed after 3 h, and their brains examined for histological injury and NOS expression. No significant differences were observed in survival or hemodynamics between the groups. Compared with the control group, animals in the E₂ group exhibited a significantly smaller increase in nNOS and iNOS expression, a smaller blood-brain-barrier disruption, and a mitigated neuronal injury. There was a significant correlation between nNOS and iNOS levels and neuronal injury. Interestingly, estradiol attenuated cerebral damage (including lower activation of nNOS and iNOS) both in male and female piglets. In conclusion, in our immature piglet model of hypovolemic cardiac arrest, E₂ downregulates iNOS and nNOS expression and results in decreased blood-brain-barrier permeability disruption and smaller neuronal injury."

CD010438,0,7892968,0,Patterns of coagulopathy during liver transplantation: experience with the first 75 cases using thrombelastography.,"Using both conventional laboratory clotting profile and thrombelastography, coagulation status was monitored intraoperatively during liver transplantation in the first 75 cases performed at the Austin Hospital between June 1988 and October 1992. Superimposed on a baseline coagulopathy due to liver disease is a specific pattern of coagulation disturbance which occurs during a liver transplant. Fibrinolysis occurs in the anhepatic stage, worsens with early reperfusion and then spontaneously resolves. In addition reperfusion is associated with a transient clotting defect. If blood loss is excessive, coagulopathy due to massive transfusion may compound the situation. Thrombelastography is a measurement technique allowing rapid on-site assessment of functional clotting status. It is particularly useful in liver transplant surgery. In combination with clinical bleeding assessment it facilitates selective use of component therapy (fresh frozen plasma, platelets and cryoprecipitate) and specific drug treatment only when it is appropriate. It also acts as a liver function test, being especially useful in assessing the graft after reperfusion."

These results demonstrate that liver transplantation can be performed without imposing excessive demands on blood transfusion services. Management should include surgical techniques to minimize bleeding and use of autologous transfusion. Use of component therapy (FFP, platelets and cryoprecipitate) should not be empirical. It should be selective on the basis of clinical bleeding assessment and guided by results of the laboratory coagulation profile and changes in thrombelastographic (TEG) parameters."

This study aimed to find assays, among those commercially available, to measure rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics. Several global conventional clotting tests, as well as clotting or chromogenic assays to measure anti-factor Xa activity, were studied. A thrombin generation test using calibrated automated thrombogram was also done. Tests were performed with the indirect factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux for comparison. A concentration-dependent prolongation of prothrombin time (PT), dilute PT, and activated partial thromboplastin time was observed with rivaroxaban. The results varied depending on the reagents. This variability cannot be standardised with the international normalised ratio system commonly used for vitamin K antagonists. Using a standard calibration curve, PT test results can be expressed in plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban rather than PT seconds or ratio. Standard methods for HepTest and two-step prothrombinase-induced clotting time (PiCT) resulted in a paradoxical response, with low concentrations of rivaroxaban reducing clotting times. This was not observed with shorter incubation times, or when antithrombin-deficient (immunodepleted) plasma was used. The chromogenic tests found a dose-dependent relationship between anti-factor Xa activity and rivaroxaban concentration. Modified specific factor Xa chromogenic assays are being further investigated. One-step PiCT and HepTest with shortened incubation times, as well as the widely available PT assay (using a rivaroxaban calibrator) could be useful to monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban accurately. Finally, all clotting and chromogenic assays showed a concentration-dependent effect induced by rivaroxaban."
CD010438,0,1129830,0,Simplification of the methods for adding and removing glycerol during freeze-preservation of human red blood cells with the high or low glycerol methods: biochemical modification prior to freezing.,"Simple methods have been developed for adding and removing glycerol during freeze-preservation with 20 per cent W/V glycerol at minus 150 C, or with 40 per cent W/V glycerol at minus 80 C. A one-step method with a 35 per cent W/V glycerol solution is used to prepare 20 per cent W/V glycerolized red blood cells, and a two-step method with a 57 per cent W/V glycerol solution is used to prepare 40 per cent W/V glycerolized red blood cells. The systems for washing glycerolized red blood cells have been simplified. This method consists of dilution of the thawed glycerolized red blood cells prior to recovery, followed by on-line dilution of these red blood cells with wash solutions during continuous flow centrifugation. This can be done in any of three commercially available washing systems, and they all use the same sodium chloride solutions. For the 40 per cent W/V glycerolized red blood cells, this process takes about 30 minutes and uses 2.2 to 3.2 liters of the sodium chloride solutions, whereas the 20 per cent W/V glycerolized red blood cells can be processed in about 20 minutes using 1.5 to 2.5 liters. After storage in CPD for three days at 4 C, red blood cells can be freeze-preserved with 40 per cent W/V glycerol at minus 80 C or with 20 per cent W/V glycerol at minus 150 C. When the thawed red blood cells are washed in the Fenwal Elutramatic, the IBM Blood Processor, or the Haemonetics Blood Processor and stored at 4 C in sodium chloride-glucose-phosphate for at least 24 hours before transfusion, they have excellent posttransfusion survival values and normal or slightly decreased oxygen transport function. Alternatively, these red blood cells can be rejuvenated before freeze-preservation so that their 2,3-DPG levels are increased and their affinity for oxygen is reduced. Red blood cells that are stored in CPD at 4 C for as long as 28 days can be rejuvenated with a solution containing pyruvate, inosine, glucose, phosphate, and adenine (PIGPA, Solution A) before freeze-preservation with 40 per cent W/V glycerol at minus 80 C.

CD010438,0,18600098,0,An unusual clinical presentation of factor XIII deficiency and issues relating to the monitoring of factor XIII replacement therapy.,"Congenital factor XIII deficiency is a very rare bleeding disorder. Patients with severe FXIII deficiency usually exhibit severe bleeding diatheses. Factor XIII is also involved in maintaining pregnancy, and women with factor XIII deficiency have a high risk of spontaneous abortions. We report here the case of a patient with a mild bleeding history before her pregnancy but who had three spontaneous haemorrhagic miscarriages. The patient was homozygous for G 501 R mutation of the factor XIII A subunit gene. We also detected a coinherited heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, probably leading to a milder bleeding tendency. The patient had successful factor XIII replacement therapy throughout her fourth pregnancy. The efficacy of the factor XIII infusions was monitored using thromboelastometry and routine factor XIII measurements. This case report shows that factor XIII deficiency should be ruled out in patients with recurrent fetal loss but with a normal miscarriage workup, even in the absence of a history of severe bleeding since childhood. We also showed that thromboelastometry could be a valuable tool for the monitoring of factor XIII replacement therapy."

The mean platelet yield in CS3000 was 2.9 +/- 0.84 x 10(11) and in MCS3p it was 2.88 +/- 0.75 x 10(11)per unit. However, only 4-7% of SDPs showed WBC levels <5 x 10(6) due to lack of appropriate methods to quantitate residual WBC counts. Six of 100 donors complained of hypocalcemic symptoms.

CD010438,0,9807604,0,The effect of low-dose heparin on hypercoagulability following abdominal aortic surgery.,"The effect of low-dose heparin on postoperative hypercoagulability was assessed using thrombelastography (TEG) in eighteen patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic surgery. Patients received unfractionated heparin 5000IU bd SC commencing on the first postoperative day. Native whole blood TEG was performed preoperatively and on day two postoperatively. A heparinase-modified TEG was performed at the same time as the native whole blood TEG on day two. There were no significant changes in the postoperative native whole blood TEG variables (r, K, alpha, MA) relative to preoperative controls. In contrast, there were significant decreases in r and K, and increases in alpha in the heparinase-modified TEGs postoperatively (P < 0.01). There were significant differences between the postoperative native whole blood and heparinase-modified TEGs for all TEG variables (P < 0.01). The results indicate that low-dose heparin reduces postoperative hypercoagulability following abdominal aortic surgery as assessed by thrombelastography."

CD010438,0,7706202,0,Single-donor platelet concentrates produced along with packed red blood cells with the Haemonetics MCS 3p: preliminary results.,"There has been an increasing interest in recent years over the qualitative superiority of single-donor platelets in the management of hemato-oncologic patients. The reasonable desire of both patients and physicians to limit the risks of transfusion along with the need for limiting the costs involved in this kind of therapy have led to application of multicomponent donations both in terms of double platelet concentrates and double products such as red blood cells (RBC) and platelets from the same donor. Single donor platelets and RBC have been collected in a semi-automated mode and only the very recent introduction of the Haemonetics MCS 3p with its SDP/RBC protocol provides a totally closed-system automated protocol for this combined collection. Twenty procedures have been carried out so far at our unit. In a mean of 87 minutes (6-7 passes), a mean of 3.1 x 10(11) platelets were collected along with approximately 220 mL of packed RBC. The leukocyte contamination of the platelet product was in the range of 0.4-1.1 x 10(7) (99% lymphocytes), and the quality of platelets was very satisfactory as measured by the hypotonic shock response, aggregation induced by ADP, collagen and ristocetin, morphology score, and membrane glycoproteins modifications. Equally satisfactory was the quality of the RBC concentrate, suspended in 80 mL of SAG-M, with a total hemoglobin (Hb) content approaching 55 g as compared to the normal Hb content of a standard RBC concentrate that is approximately 62 g.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010438,0,9621258,0,Distribution of mobilized progenitor cells in the buffy coat of the haemonetics MCS3p cell separator: a study to optimize the collection of progenitors by leukapheresis.,"Hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells for transplantation can be mobilized into the circulation and collected by leukapheresis. In this procedure, the leukocytes are distributed in the buffy coat along a density gradient, and the composition of the final product depends on which layer was collected. For the Haemonetics MCS3p Cell Separator, the manufacturer recommended starting the progenitor cell collection at a light transmission of 30%-40% (compared with plasma) and continue it for 40-50 ml. To optimize the use of this machine, the buffy coat it produces was studied in 12 patients by collecting it in fractions of increasing specific weight. Each fraction was analyzed by morphology, immunocytometry, and cell culture. We found that the buffy coat uniformly contains 8 times more leukocytes than blood, but the proportion of each white cell type varies along a gradient. The lymphocyte-predominant lighter layers are richer in CD34+ cells when compared with the granulocyte-predominant denser layers (6-14 times versus 2-4 times more than blood). The majority of CD34+ cells are found at a light transmission of 10%-70% (hematocrit 6-9). We conclude that cells for transplantation should be collected in a lighter fraction of the buffy coat than originally suggested by the manufacturer."

Thrombin-induced platelet-fibrin clot strength (MA), time to initial platelet-fibrin clot formation (R), C-reactive protein (CRP), prothrombotic factors, activated GPIIb/IIIa receptor expression and other biomarkers were studied in patients with asymptomatic stable CAD (AS), in patients undergoing PCI for stable (SA) and unstable angina (UA). MA and R were measured by thrombelastography, GPIIb/IIIa expression by flow cytometry and all other markers by fluorokine multianalyte profiling assays. An overall increase in all measurements from a clinically stable to an unstable disease state was observed. There was a distinct stepwise increment in MA [AS vs. SA (p = 0.02), SA vs. UA (p = 0.02) and AS vs. UA (p < 0.001)]. MA exhibited the strongest correlation with other prothrombotic markers (p < or = 0.02), with CRP (p < 0.001) at all levels of CAD acuity. A distinct pathophysiological state of heightened platelet function, hypercoagulability and inflammation marks the presence of unstable cardiovascular disease requiring intervention.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the coagulation status of patients with documented CAD and type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and non-diabetic patients with coronary artery disease with the PFA-100® and the ROTEM®. No differences were found in platelet function as measured with collagen/epinephrine (263.6 ± 70.6 s vs. 254.6 ± 65.3 s) and collagen/ADP cartridges (105.3 ± 63.2 s vs. 90.6 ± 47.3 s) in CAD patients with DM and CAD patients without DM. Measured with the EXTEM reagent of the ROTEM®, mean maximum clot elasticity (MCE) in patients with CAD and DM (233.6 ± 86.9) was significantly longer than in CAD patients without DM (186.7 ± 54.5), (p = 0.03). A similar result was seen using the INTEM reagent; patients with CAD and DM (234.4 ± 83.9) showed a higher value for MCE than CAD patients without DM (190.8 ± 57.8) which was of borderline significance (p = 0.053). Moreover, a weak trend for higher maximum clot firmness (MCF) was seen in CAD patients with DM compared with CAD patients without DM with the EXTEM reagent (68.1 ± 7.5 vs. 63.6 ± 8.6, p = 0.08) and the INTEM reagent (68.4 ± 7.2 vs. 64.1 ± 8.2, p = 0.09). The ROTEM® analysis indicates increased coagulability in patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus compared to non-diabetic CAD patients. Moreover, the ROTEM® device seems to be an appropriate and easy-to-use tool to describe the coagulation status in these patients groups."

The coagulation process was analysed by thromboelastography. R-time, reflecting intrinsic coagulation, increased in a dose dependent manner between NaCl-treated and aprotinin-treated blood. These findings suggest a dose dependent impairment of intrinsic coagulation by aprotinin."
CD010438,0,16221315,0,Mechanistic implications for the use and monitoring of recombinant activated factor VII in trauma.,"As interest in the use of activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa) in trauma grows, questions arise regarding how best to monitor rFVIIa therapy and when rFVIIa may be expected to improve hemostasis. Knowledge of the mechanisms of action may be combined with available data on laboratory monitoring and efficacy in various coagulopathic states in coming to clinically relevant conclusions. This review addresses the physiology of hemostasis, placing emphasis on how rFVIIa influences the process by both tissue factor dependent and tissue factor independent mechanisms. This is extended to a mechanistic consideration of how rFVIIa may function under acidotic, hypothermic, and hemodilutional and/or consumptive conditions of trauma related coagulopathy. When these considerations are viewed alongside the available clinical data, it becomes apparent that rFVIIa has potential to improve hemostasis during trauma coagulopathy, within limitations. Common laboratory procedures are discussed with reference to mechanisms of action of rFVIIa and the available clinical data. Although there is no single assay that can predict rFVIIa efficacy in trauma, the prothrombin time (PT) is recommended as a minimum. Although a shortened PT does not predict success, correction of PT into the normal range may be a better indicator. A nonresponding PT appears to indicate that rFVIIa alone will not lead to hemostasis, and that additional blood products and other measures must be applied. Once the patient is more stable, PT and thromboelastography are recommended."

CD010438,0,9128188,0,In vitro paraoxon (E 600) exposure: no activating effect on human blood coagulation.,"The in vitro effects of the organophosphorus compound (OPC) paraoxon (POX) on human blood coagulation were assessed by fibrin monomer (FM) concentration measurements and thrombelastographic (TEG) determinations. Increasing doses of POX dissolved in alcohol (POX + ALO) or alcohol (ALO) only in corresponding quantities were added to blood drawn from six human volunteers. In both series (POX + ALO and ALO-only) FM concentrations increased in comparison to the baseline levels. No statistically significant differences exist, however, between FM measurements performed on blood with POX + ALO and those performed on blood with ALO-only. No coagulation-activating effect of POX in vitro was demonstrable; the changes seen in vitro are due to the ALO used as a vehicle. The thrombelastographic parameters showed several changes in the POX + ALO series as dosage increased. At high POX levels, reaction time r and clot formation time k became longer than in the baseline measurements, the clot formation rate alpha and the maximum amplitude MA were reduced. The TEG changes indicate a hypocoagulable state, probably due to the POX effect on platelet function and/or inhibition of clotting factors (serine proteases)."
CD010438,0,14742357,0,Hydroxyethyl starch as a priming solution for cardiopulmonary bypass impairs hemostasis after cardiac surgery.,"We investigated the influence of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) as a priming solution for the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit on postoperative hemostasis in 45 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting. In a randomized sequence, 20 mL/kg of low-molecular-weight HES (HES 120; molecular weight 120,000 daltons), high-molecular-weight HES (HES 400; molecular weight 400,000 daltons), or 4% human albumin (ALB) was used as the main component of the CPB priming solution. The thromboelastographic values indicating the speed of solid clot formation (alpha-angle) and the strength of the fibrin clot (maximum amplitude and shear elastic modulus) were decreased up to 2 h after CPB in both HES groups. Four hours after the operation, blood loss through the chest tubes had increased in the HES groups: HES 120, mean 804 mL (range, 330-1390 mL); HES 400, mean 1008 mL (range, 505-1955 mL); and ALB, mean 681 mL (range, 295-1500 mL) (P < 0.05 between the HES 400 and ALB groups). We conclude that HES solutions, when given in doses of 20 mL/kg in connection with the CPB prime, compromise hemostasis after cardiac surgery. This effect appears related to formation of a less stable thrombus compared with that formed in the presence of ALB."

In order to test the hypothesis that preloading infusion (PLI) with 6% hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5 (HES 200), or 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (HES 130) solution can attenuate the hypercoagulable state and inhibit excessive platelet activation of patients with colon cancer, we selected 35 colon cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted radical colectomy. They were received randomly a test of 15 ml/kg of either HES 200 (n=17), or HES 130 (n=18) over a 30-min period preoperatively. In addition, fifteen healthy volunteers were selected as normal control group. Coagulation function was assessed by thrombelastography (TEG), platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and CD62P was analyzed by flow cytometry before PLI, the end of PLI, 1 h after PLI, and 1 h after the end of surgery. Results demonstrated that hypercoagulable state indicated by TEG and excessive platelet activation was found in patients with colon cancer. We found that preloading infusion with HES 200/0.5 can inhibit platelet activation, and the two solutions, especially HES 200/0.5, compromised TEG parameters that indicated hypercoagulability of patients with colon cancer during perioperative period."

CD010438,0,3619091,0,Effects of progressive blood loss on coagulation as measured by thrombelastography.,"The effects of progressive blood loss on coagulation were studied in 87 adults (age 23-66 yr) undergoing a variety of operations under general anesthesia. None had preoperative alterations in coagulation or liver function and none were receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication. Whole blood coagulation status was quantitated using thrombelastography (TEG). Blood samples for TEG were obtained 5 min before and 15 min after induction of anesthesia, after each increment of blood loss (EBL) equalling 5% of estimated blood volume (EBV), at the end of surgery, and 2 hr post-operatively. Patients with EBL exceeding 0.15 EBV were given packed red cells and crystalloid solution. Patients with EBL less than 0.15 EBV received only crystalloid. Thrombelastography analysis showed a trend toward increased coagulability with progressive blood loss. Two of four patients with 80% loss of EBV maintained normal to enhanced coagulation status, although the other two developed clinical and thrombelastographic evidence of coagulopathy. Thrombelastography allowed rapid intraoperative diagnosis and specific treatment of loss of platelet activity in the latter two patients. We conclude that during moderate to massive blood loss, use of supplemental fresh frozen plasma and/or platelets should be reserved for patients with documented defects in coagulation. Thrombelastography is useful for the detection and management of coagulation defects associated with intraoperative blood loss."

CD010438,0,10475284,0,Use of abciximab-modified thrombelastography in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.,"Thrombelastography (TEG) is a reliable coagulation monitoring system that can guide blood product transfusion in cardiac surgery. The maximum amplitude (MA) of TEG measures clot strength, which is dependent on both fibrinogen level and platelet function. Inhibition of platelet function with abciximab-fab is suggested to permit quantitative assessment of the contribution of fibrinogen to clot strength. We hypothesized that abciximab-modified TEG permits prediction of plasma fibrinogen levels and that the difference of standard MA and abciximab-modified MA (deltaMA) is a correlate for platelet function. We correlated abciximab-modified MA with plasma fibrinogen levels and deltaMA with platelet count in patients undergoing coronary revascularization. Correlation between plasma fibrinogen levels and abciximab-modified MA was significant (adjusted r2: 0.8; P < 0.0001). Correlation of deltaMA with platelet count was not significant when calculated in millimeters (adjusted r2: 0.04; P = 0.73). However, when deltaMA was calculated in dynes per square centimeter (deltaGMA), it correlated significantly with platelet count (adjusted r2: 0.51; P < 0.0001). We conclude that abciximab-modified TEG may therefore help to discriminate between hypofibrinogenemia and platelet dysfunction as a cause of decreased MA."
CD010438,0,17179819,0,Heparin-induced inhibitory effects of a prothrombin complex concentrate on global tests of haemostasis.,"Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) have been used as bypassing agents for the treatment of haemophilia A patients with inhibitor as well as for replacement therapy in congenital and acquired deficiencies of vitamin-K-dependent clotting factors. The efficacy of PCC is variable, however, especially during long-term and high-dose use, and all currently available products of this nature contain heparin. We have examined the haemostatic properties of PCC using reconstituted whole blood made by mixing coagulation-factor-deficient plasma and washed blood cells. In rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM), the recommended therapeutic dose of Proplex ST corrected the abnormal patterns. At higher concentrations, however, the ROTEM patterns regressed. In addition, specific assays of coagulation factors appeared unreliable in the presence of 2.5 U/ml Proplex ST; the abnormalities were corrected when protamine sulfate was added. The findings suggest that the presence of heparin in PCC might have a greater effect on global haemostasis. Careful attention to the anticoagulant effect as well as thrombogenicity of PCC is required. Monitoring therapy using such as ROTEM analysis could be highly informative."
CD010438,0,17845651,0,Effects of albumin 5% and artificial colloids on clot formation in small infants.,"Albumin is often cited in textbooks as the gold standard for fluid replacement in paediatrics, but in practice artificial colloids are more frequently used. Although one concern with the use of artificial colloids is their intrinsic action on haemostasis, the available data in children are inconclusive for 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (HES) and no data exist for gelatine solution with respect to coagulation. A total of 42 children (3-15 kg) undergoing surgery and needing colloid replacement were randomly assigned to receive 15 mlxkg(-1) of either albumin 5%, 4% modified gelatine solution or 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 solution. Standard coagulation tests and modified thrombelastography (ROTEM) were performed. After colloid administration, routine coagulation test results changed significantly and comparably in all groups, although activated partial thromboplastin time values increased more with gelatine and HES. Coagulation time was unchanged in the children who received albumin or gelatine but other activated modified thrombelastography values were significantly impaired in all groups. After gelatine and after albumin the median clot firmness decreased significantly but remained within the normal range. Following HES, coagulation time increased significantly, and clot formation time, alpha angle, clot firmness, and fibrinogen/fibrin polymerisation were significantly more impaired than for albumin or gelatine, reaching median values below the normal range. From a haemostatic point of view it might be preferable to use gelatine solution as an alternative to albumin; HES showed the greatest effects on the overall coagulation process."

T4 and T8 lymphocyte subsets were found to be reduced in each of 13 lymphocytopenic platelet donors tested but T4/T8 ratios were similar to those of controls (2.51 +/- 0.79 and 2.33 +/- 0.58 respectively). No adverse effects on platelet donor health were observed but it is suggested that platelet apheresis protocols should be designed to minimize lymphocyte loss."

The aim of this study was to examine whether in these patients the values of coagulation parameters differ significantly with respect to the source of the blood samples. In a group of 44 patients with severe sepsis, we compared the values of coagulation, thromboelastography and selected hematological parameters between the arterial and venous blood. In most of the investigated parameters (international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen concentration, erythrocyte count, leukocyte and platelet count, hemoglobin level and thromboelastography parameters), we did not find significant differences (P > 0.1). However, we found a significantly lower antithrombin activity and a significantly higher D-dimer concentration in venous blood compared to arterial blood (P < 0.05). This could be associated with increased consumption of antithrombin and generation of D-dimer as a consequence of microthrombi formation in the capillaries. We therefore conclude that for the purpose of assessment of coagulation status in septic patients, arterial and venous blood cannot be treated as equivalent."

We studied the effects of a new endotoxin adsorber device (Alteco LPS adsorber) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with ECC, with special reference to safety and ease of use. Fifteen patients undergoing coronary artery bypass and/or valvular surgery were studied. In 9 patients, the LPS Adsorber was included in the bypass circuit between the arterial filter and the venous reservoir. Flow through the adsorber was started when the aorta was clamped and stopped at the end of perfusion. Flow rate was kept at 150 ml/min. Six patients served as controls with no adsorber in the circuit. Samples were taken for analysis of endotoxin, TNFalpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 as well as complement factors C3, C4 and C1q. Whole blood coagulation status was evaluated using thromboelastograpy (TEG) and platelet count. No adverse events were encountered when the adsorber was used in the circuit. Blood flow through the device was easily monitored and kept at the desired level. Platelet count decreased in both groups during surgery. TEG data revealed a decrease in whole blood clot strength in the control group while it was preserved in the adsorber group. Endotoxin was detected in only 2 patients and IL-1beta in 4 patients. IL-6 decreased in both groups whereas no change in TNF concentrations was found. C3 fell in both groups, but no changes wer found in C4 and C1q. The Alteco LPS adsorber can be used safely and is easy to handle in the bypass circuit. No complications related to the use of the adsorber were noted. The intended effects of the adsorber, i.e. removal of endotoxin from the blood stream could not be evaluated in this study, presumably due to the small number of patients and the relatively short perfusion times."
CD010438,0,11011805,0,Comparative efficacy of different low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) and drug interactions with LMWH: implications for management of vascular disorders.,"The low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are more efficacious and safer than unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis and to a certain extent in the treatment of acute ischemic syndromes. Because of their predictable pharmacokinetics and bioavailability after subcutaneous administration, LMWHs can be more convenient for outpatient use than UFH. Differences in the manufacturing process of LMWHs result in significant structural and molecular weight differences; thus, LMWHs have individual biochemical and pharmacological profiles and are not interchangeable on the basis of either mass or anti-Xa activity. Using thromboelastograph (TEG) and platelet aggregometry, this investigation compared the in vitro efficacy among various LMWHs and examined the interactions between LMWHs and platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antagonists. TEG was used to determine the ability of platelet and fibrin interactions to augment blood clots, an effect measured under conditions of maximal platelet activation during clot formation accelerated by recombinant human tissue factor (TF). The comparative efficacy of LMWHs on different mediator-induced clot retraction in human blood was assessed by TEG, which demonstrated the potency of different LMWHs to inhibit various mediator-induced clot formations under shear. Tinzaparin was relatively more effective in inhibiting TF-, lipopolysaccharide-, factor (f) Xa-, and thrombin-induced clot formation under shear. Under these conditions, platelets significantly enhance clot strength (eightfold vs. platelet-free fibrin clots). LMWHs appear to have broader efficacy than other anticoagulants. Abciximab and roxifiban further inhibited clot strength by affecting the transmission of platelet contractile force to fibrin by platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptors. Subtherapeutic doses of tinzaparin combined with abciximab or roxifiban resulted in a distinct synergy that improved anticoagulant and antiplatelet efficacy mediated by TF, fXa, or thrombin. As these data suggest, the combination of low-dose tinzaparin with low-dose GPIIb/IIIa antagonists (abciximab, roxifiban) may be efficacious in the prevention and treatment of various thromboembolic disorders."

CD010438,0,20400895,0,Tissue plasminogen activator induced fibrinolysis: standardization of method using thromboelastography.,"Fibrinolysis is a complex physiological process that involves the interaction of several anticoagulant proteins. Defects of the fibrinolytic system are extremely difficult to diagnose and study because there are no standardized tests available. Thromboelastography is a novel method that allows the study of both coagulation and fibrinolysis using one sample of whole blood, thereby allowing a more physiologic assessment of the coagulation process. Several in-vitro studies have been attempted to determine whether thromboelastography would be a useful assay for the study of fibrinolysis but have reported problems with reproducibility and reliability. Here we report the process involved in developing a thromboelastographic assay in which tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is used to induce fibrinolysis. The assay was standardized to ensure that the concentration of the coagulation inducer (tissue factor) and fibrinolytic agent (t-PA) was adequate to induce a clot with lysis parameters that were reproducible and reliable. This method can be used to rapidly assess the intrinsic fibrinolytic potential of whole blood. Our assay showed that it could rapidly predict high levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor, and this information would be beneficial in patients with acute stroke or myocardial infarction."

Lysis on set time on the completion of peripheral bypass anastomoses <50% was detected in 12 patients (52.2%) originating from group A. At the other sampling times (preoperatively, 15 min after sternotomy, at the end of the procedures, and 24 h later) thromboelastographic parameters were similar in all groups. In group A no significant correlations between lysis on set time, postoperative blood loss and D-dimer levels were found.

For example, the formation of biologically active peptides, C3a and C5a (anaphylatoxins), is a result of complement activation via the alternative pathway. It cannot be denied that the reinjection of large quantities of these molecules could be at the origin of serious side effects. We report herein the anaphylatoxin levels found with 9 hemapheresis procedures (4 plasma filtration membranes, 3 systems for platelet collection, 2 plasma treatment techniques (dextran sulfate cellulose column and cascade filtration)). All the filtration procedures generated very high levels of anaphylatoxins, especially C3a. In contrast, the centrifugation systems produced lower levels. However, considerable amounts of C3a were found with the Cobe Spectra and V50 Haemonetics blood cell separators. The anaphylatoxins generated by the primary filter were partially retained by the dextran sulfate column. These high toxin levels enable an assessment of the degree of hemo-incompatibility of these systems. However, it remains difficult to evaluate whether these anaphylatoxins are dangerous or not."

The perioperative bleeding was minimalized through an acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH). During the procedure we monitored the patient's hemocoagulation profile. ANH is one of the possibilities for practical and pragmatic hemotherapy. It is a safe and effective method when facing massive blood loss or when it is necessary to temporarily replace or substitute the blood with a fluid during the operation (through a transfusion of allogeneic blood); and the patient benefits from the procedure. We argue that during ANH, the hypercoagulatory state appears in the patient--and even during the introduction of a combined solution of both crystalloids and colloids. In fact, during ANH it should not be recommended to provide a substitute for the patient's blood using only a single crystalloid solution alone (Tab. 2, Ref. 16)."

Reduction of haematocrit (HCT) has been reported to influence traditional thromboelastography parameters without compromising ""in vitro"" blood coagulation. We performed this case-control study to evaluate ROTEM profiles in sideropenic anaemia patients with different degrees of reduction of HCT levels. Forty consecutively referred patients with sideropenic anaemia were enrolled. A group of 40 healthy age and gender matched subjects acted as a control. The influence of HCT on ROTEM was assessed in the study population and in a model of artificially reconstituted blood with modified HCT values. Cases presented significantly increased levels of maximum clot firmness (MCF) as compared to controls (p < 0.001) mimicking a sort of ""hypercoagulable profile"". However, thrombin generation tests failed to detect an increase in thrombin generation in cases as compared to controls. A statistically significant inverse linear correlation between HCT and MCF (p < 0.0001) was found. In addition, ROTEM profiles following ""in vitro"" manipulation of HCT confirmed the inverse linear correlation between HCT and MCF found in the study population. In conclusion, the increased clot firmness found by ROTEM in anaemic patients is likely to be related to the method in itself rather than representing a marker of hypercoagulability ""in vivo"". Since ROTEM is widely used by anaesthesiologists when deciding the optimisation of products supplementation during surgery, attention should be paid in the case of anaemic patients taking depending on the peculiar thrombo-elastography profile found."

CD010438,0,23138460,0,Circulating and platelet-derived microparticles in human blood enhance thrombosis on atherosclerotic plaques.,"Plaque rupture followed by thrombosis is the underlying cause of the majority of acute coronary syndromes. Circulating microparticles (cMPs), membrane blebs released into blood by activated cells, have been associated to vascular diseases. Specifically, high levels of platelet-derived microparticles (pMPs) have been found in patients with coronary disease. However, it is unknown whether microparticles have a contributing role to the development of damaged vessel wall-induced arterial thrombi. The aim of this proof of concept study was to investigate whether an increased number of cMPs and pMPs could functionally contribute to blood thrombogenicity on areas of arterial damage. Microparticles were isolated from blood of healthy volunteers and were characterised by flow cytometry. Effects of microparticles on platelet deposition were assessed under controlled flow conditions exposing damaged arterial wall in the Badimon perfusion chamber and collagen type-I in the flat perfusion chamber to human blood. Platelet deposition on damaged arteries was significantly increased in cMP- and pMP-enriched bloods (p<0.05). pMPs also induced increase in platelet (p<0.05) and fibrin (p<0.05) deposition on human atherosclerotic arteries and in platelet adhesion to purified collagen surfaces. pMP-enriched blood induced a dose-dependent shortening of epinephrine/collagen closure time evaluated by PFA-100 (p<0.001), increased low-dose ADP-induced platelet aggregation by LTA (p<0.05), and decreased clotting time by thromboelastography (p<0.01). In conclusion, an increased content of cMPs and pMPs, even in normal blood conditions, enhance platelet deposition and thrombus formation. This study shows for the first time that, beyond biomarkers of cell activation, blood microparticles have functional effects on cardiovascular atherothrombotic disease."

CD010438,0,17299655,0,Transfusion dependency of cardiac surgery--update 2006.,"In developed countries perioperative blood transfusion requirements for red blood cell concentrates (RBC), platelet concentrates (PC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and stable plasma derivatives have now levelled off with more patients requiring less or no products whilst fewer patients need the larger proportion of donations. This text explores the reasons for such a development in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery where the transfusion requirement has drastically declined in recent years. A reduced requirement of a mean of 2 RBCs is now the need per patient in most centers. Such a reduction is possible through various recent perioperative improvements: (i) thorough preoperative haematological checks in order to equip the patient for blood loss, surgical trauma and extracorporeal circulation (ECC) in which heparinized blood is pumped at high speed through an oxygenator, heat exchanger, reservoirs, tubings and connectors. (ii) Peroperative administration of inhibitors of fibrinolysis (aprotinin, epsilon-aminocaproic acid) reduce profuse haemorrhagic tendency. Successful attempts to minimise ECCs, including foamless aspiration of wound blood, refined surgical technology, tissue glue, and point-of-care laboratory testing (POCT) in the operating theatre all contribute to a reduced transfusion requirement. A substantial proportion of patients can now be operated on without ECC. New thrombelastography analysis allows for real-time monitoring of haemorrhagic/thrombogenic risk. Modern blood product quality contributes to limiting blood product usage. (iii) During the postoperative recovery phase, anaemia can be corrected by i.v.iron and recombinant human erythropoietin. Such measures allow the transfusion trigger, based on haemoglobin concentration, to be set as low as 70 g/l in suitable patients."

The aim of this study was to compare in vitro the fibrinolytic activity of tPA and uPA and evaluate their possible interaction. Blood coagulation and fibrinolysis were conducted by rotation thromboelastometry, whereas blood clotting was induced by CaCl2 and tissue factor and fibrinolysis additively by tPA and uPA. Effective concentration 50% of tPA and uPA fibrinolytic activity in blood was found to be 90 and 33 IU/ml relating to the units of activity established by manufacturers in the absence of blood. uPA-induced fibrinolysis in blood was faster compared with tPA used at the same units of activity. In contrast, in a blood-free system containing fibrinogen, plasminogen, and thrombin, fibrinolysis induced by uPA was weaker than by tPA. Treating of blood with tranexamic acid (60 mmol/l) was followed by decreased fibrinolytic potential of both exogenous tPA and uPA, despite uPA by itself is known to be not sensitive to aminocaproic acids. Thus, uPA exerted stronger activity in blood but weaker activity in blood-free system, compared with tPA. Taking into account the intermolecular binding of uPA to tPA, it could be suggested that interaction of exogenous uPA with plasma-containing tPA provided amplification of fibrinolysis due to formation of uPA/tPA complex possessing high affinity to fibrin."

One of its leading symptoms is the decrease in circulating fibrinogen. We investigated the effect of fibrinogen concentrate (Haemocomplettan P) on fibrinogen plasma levels, coagulation parameters and mortality in a rat model of sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation. The disseminated intravascular coagulation was characterized by elevated thrombin-antithrombin complex and a sharp drop in circulating fibrinogen. Coagulation abnormalities were evaluated by thrombelastography. Plasma fibrinogen levels decreased from 2.06 +/- 0.2 to 0.16 +/- 0.1 g/l following administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Thrombelastographic measurements revealed a concurrent decrease in maximum amplitude and an increase in reaction time. Treatment with fibrinogen concentrate (Haemocomplettan P, 25-200 mg/kg body weight intravenously) resulted in a statistically significant dose-dependent increase in fibrinogen plasma levels and amelioration of the measured coagulation abnormalities.

Four commercial washing systems were studied, three which used sodium chloride solutions with serial or continuous-flow centrifugation and one which used sugar solutions and dilution/agglomeration. Washing was most efficient using sodium chloride solutions in the IBM Blood Processor, an automated serial centrifugation procedure and in the Fenwal Elutramatic, a continuous-flow centrifugation procedure. Less efficient washing was achieved in the Haemonetics Processor 15, a continuous-flow centrifugation procedure and the least efficient washing occurred using the original and modified dilution/agglomeration procedures. To achieve the most efficient washing, three principles must be utilized: concentration of the red blood cells to hematocrit values of 90 per cent, prior to washing or freezing. Liquid-stored red blood cells concentrated to hematocrit values of 90V per cent should be diluted with hypertonic sodium chloride solutions prior to recovery and washing. Red blood cells containing 20 per cent or 40 per cent W/V glycerol should be diluted with hypertonic sodium chloride solutions before recovery and washing.

Thrombelastographic methods have been used in ex vivo studies and were suggested useful to evaluate the individual response to bypassing agents. This study aimed at assessing changes in thrombelastographic profiles and their association to clinical outcome in patients treated with recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa). Ten patients with acquired haemophilia were treated with rFVIIa for acute bleeding. Thrombelastography was performed after activation with a small amount of tissue factor in samples obtained before and after in vivo administration of rFVIIa. In patients studied before and after a first dose, correction of the thrombelastographic profile was observed but did not predict cessation of bleeding. During steady-state dosing, the median Alpha angle tended to be higher in patients with a good clinical treatment response as compared with patients with a partial or poor response. Similar trends were observed for clotting time and clot formation time. A good clinical treatment response was more frequent in patients with a fully corrected trough-level thrombelastographic profile as compared with patients with an abnormal profile. However, a poor treatment response was observed also in a surgical patient with a normal thrombelastographic profile during steady-state dosing. In conclusion, thrombelastographic monitoring was sensitive to haemostatic changes in response to treatment with rFVIIa.

WBC reduction can be achieved directly during plateletpheresis or by filtration. Continuous filtration with low filtration rates provides SDPs of good purity. To compensate the platelet (PLT) loss due to filtration, the PLT yield in the unfiltered primary product should be optimal. Fifty donors underwent plateletpheresis with the MCS+ blood cell separator (Haemonetics) with the new Fuji surge technique and continuous WBC filtration. Twelve SDPs were analysed for PLT yield, red blood cells (RBC), WBC, and pH after collection (Day 0) and at the end of storage (Day 5). Thereafter, further 38 SDPs were measured for PLT and WBC content in routine production at Day 0. PLT were determined electronically, RBC and WBC were counted manually (Neubauer and Nageotte chamber, respectively). For pH measurement, a pH-meter was used. Mean blood volume processed was 2621 +/- 112 ml in a donation time of 76 +/- 10 min. An average PLT yield of 3.45 +/- 0.88 x 10(11) was collected in a product volume of 325 +/- 77 ml. The collection efficiency was 60.0 +/- 5.5%. WBC contamination of all units tested was 0.046 +/- 0.059 x 10(6) and the RBC content of the SDPs analysed at Day 0 was 0.014 +/- 0.003 x 10(9). The pH was well maintained over the storage period of 5 days. The data indicate that Fuji surge technique and continuous in-line leukocyte filtration allow for the collection of SDPs with high platelet yield and low leukocyte contamination, meeting the Council of Europe quality standards."

CD010438,0,20455183,0,[Perioperative coagulation monitoring - medical and economic aspects].,For preoperative haemostatic assessment a structured questionnaire for the bleeding history of the patient should be primarily used. Only in case of abnormalities an additional laboratory coagulation testing is recommended. Such a test set must include functional testing of platelets as defects of the primary haemostasis are frequent. In the event of acute acquired perioperative coagulopathy laboratory coagulation testing is a prerequisite for sophisticated and precise diagnosis and therapy. Points of care techniques like thrombelastography are capable to provide fast and extensive information.
CD010438,0,8564676,0,[Traumatic emergencies and hemostasis].,"The occurrence of bleeding in trauma patients is a life-threatening problem which can be explained by different mechanisms. The infusion of cristalloids, colloids, packed red blood cells, or even fresh frozen plasma is very rarely responsible for bleeding but it can contribute to dilute the patient's platelet pool, and especially dilutional thrombocytopenia is the first cause of bleeding after massive transfusion. Blood coagulation factor activity is decreased after a massive fluid infusion is performed but it has to reach a dramatically low plasma level in order to induce troubles. It has to be emphasized that colloids and especially dextrans can impair the patient's haemostasis by interfering the same way with the factor VIII-von Willebrand complex and fibrin formation. Gelatins do not interfere with platelets or with the coagulation system. A third mechanism that can explain the strong link between haemostasis and haemodilution is the haemostatic role of red cells. It has been shown in experimental models that red cells play a definite function in promoting platelet accretion on the damaged vessel surface. Higher values of haematocrit (Ht) are responsible for a better platelet adhesion On the opposite, platelet adhesion decreases when low values of Ht (< 20%) are reached. Hypothermia can also impair platelet function and worsen the bleeding. A simplified monitoring of haemostasis can be proposed with platelet count, whole blood coagulation clotting time, immediately available activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time with bedside portable monitors and thromboelastography. Haematocrit and body temperature have to be monitored as well."
CD010438,0,20007735,0,Multidisciplinary approach to the challenge of hemostasis.,"A multidisciplinary panel consisting of experts chosen by the 2 chairs of the group representing experts in anesthesiology, blood banking, hematology, critical care medicine, and various surgical disciplines (trauma, cardiac, pediatric, neurologic, obstetrics, and vascular) convened in January 2008 to discuss hemostasis and management of the bleeding patient across different clinical settings, with a focus on perioperative considerations. Although there are many ways to define hemostasis, one clinical definition would be control of bleeding without the occurrence of pathologic thrombotic events (i.e., when balance among procoagulant, anticoagulant, fibrinolytic, and antifibrinolytic activities is achieved). There are common hemostatic challenges that include lack of scientific evidence and standardized guidelines for the use of therapeutic drugs, need for reliable and rapid laboratory tools for measuring hemostasis, and individual variability. Clinically meaningful and accurate real-time laboratory data reflecting a patient's hemostatic status are needed to guide treatment decisions. Current available routine laboratory tests of hemostasis (e.g., platelet count, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, and activated partial thromboplastin time) do not reflect the complexity of in vivo hemostasis and can mislead the clinician. Although point-of-care coagulation monitoring tests including measures of thromboelastography/elastometry provide insight into overall hemostatic status, they are time-consuming to perform, complex to interpret, and require trained personnel. There is a particular need to develop laboratory tests that can measure the effects of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents for individual patients, predict bleeding complications, and guide therapy when and if treatment with blood products or pharmacologic drugs is required. Formation of an organization comprised of specialists who treat bleeding patients will foster multidisciplinary collaborations and promote discussions of the current state of hemostasis treatment and future priorities for hemostasis research. Controlled trials with clinically meaningful end points and suitable study populations, as well as observational studies, investigator-initiated studies, and large registry and database studies are essential to answer questions in hemostasis. Because of the complexities of maintaining hemostatic balance, advances in hemostasis research and continuing communication across specialties are required to improve patient care and outcomes."

Nephropathy was noted in 18, gastrointestinal bleedings in 13, thrombosis of legs in 4, cases. Haemostasis was studied in the successive phases of the process on 185 occasions altogether. The studies included four different capillary tests, thromboelastography, the Gerendás coagulogram, determination of partial thromboplastin time and two platelet-function tests. Additional renal biopsy was performed in 10 cases, mesocolon and skin biopsy in one case each. The results of at least one of the capillary tests were found positive in each of the patients in some stage of the process. The coagulation status was marked by hyperocagulability either in itself or combined with laboratory signs of hypocoagulability. Immunohistological study of the biopsy specimens revealed glomerular fibrin deposits in 7 cases. On the evidence of the follow-up studies the laboratory tests may be used for the assessment of the activity of the process.

CD010438,0,12851533,0,Reversal of the International Normalized Ratio with recombinant activated factor VII in central nervous system bleeding during warfarin thromboprophylaxis: clinical and biochemical aspects.,"Major bleeding is a frequent and hazardous complication associated with thromboprophylaxis using vitamin-K antagonists (VKA). Suggested regimens for control of highly elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR) and hemorrhagic events during VKA treatment include administration of vitamin K, infusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or a prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). In contrast, this communication present the first report on the efficacious use of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) as additional therapy in seven patients presenting with central nervous system (CNS) bleeding emergencies. Pre-treatment INRs ranged from 1.7 to 6.6, and 10 min after a single dose of rFVIIa (10-40 microg/kg) all INRs were </= 1.5. Six patients underwent drainage of the CNS hematoma and all patients survived. No untoward biochemical signs of coagulation activation were detected and no incidence of thromboembolism was observed. In ex-vivo experimental studies, profiles of continuous whole blood clot formation were evaluated by thrombelastography in 25 patients on VKA treatment (INR 1.7-4.3), demonstrating a significantly prolonged initiation phase and diminished propagation of clot formation. Ex-vivo supplementation with rFVIIa to blood of six patients returned a distinct reduction of the prolonged initiation but variable changes in the maximum velocity of clot formation. The ex-vivo experiments and our clinical data support recent suggestions that rFVIIa might substitute for infusion of FFP or PCC in acute reversal of VKA treatment."

CD010438,0,23184484,0,Effects of cangrelor in coronary artery disease patients with and without diabetes mellitus: an in vitro pharmacodynamic investigation.,"Platelets from patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are hyper-reactive and whether cangrelor, a potent intravenous P2Y(12) receptor blocker, has differential pharmacodynamic (PD) effects according DM status is unknown. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the in vitro PD effects of cangrelor in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with and without DM. This prospective study enrolled 120 clopidogrel-naïve patients with CAD on aspirin therapy. PD assessments using cangrelor (500 nmol/l) in vitro included vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein assay to obtain the P2Y(12) reactivity index (PRI), and multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA). In a 20 patients subgroup, dose-dependent response was assessed following exposure to escalating concentrations (baseline, 5, 50, 500 and 5,000 nmol/l); thrombin generation processes were evaluated by thromboelastography (TEG). PD data were evaluable in 103 patients. No differences in baseline PD parameters were observed in DM (n = 48) and non-DM (n = 45) subjects. Cangrelor reduced PRI values irrespective of DM status (p < 0.0001), yielding no difference in patients with and without DM (16.1 ± 12.3 vs. 16.8 ± 11.3; p = 0.346). All MEA values were significantly reduced, although this was of greater magnitude with purinergic compared to non-purinergic agonists. A trend analysis showed a dose-dependent effect on platelet inhibition, with no interaction due to DM status, whereas no significant dose-dependent effect was observed for TEG-derived parameters. Therefore, in vitro cangrelor provides potent and dose-dependent blockade of the platelet P2Y(12) receptor, with no differential effect in DM and non-DM patients. In addition, in vitro cangrelor exerts moderate inhibitory effects on non-purinergic platelet signaling pathways, without modulating platelet-derived thrombin generation processes."

Our goal was to design a thrombelastography-based method to characterize the effects of FXIII on plasma clot strength. Normal human plasma was exposed to 0 or 200 mug/ml anti-FXIII antibodies for 20 min prior to celite activation and calcium addition. Other plasma had addition of fibrinogen (625 mg/dl)/FXIII (2 U/ml) or 30% dilution with hydroxyethyl starch before exposure to 0 or 200 mug/ml anti-FXIII antibodies. Thromboelastography was performed and data were collected until stable clot strength was observed. The exposure of normal plasma to anti-FXIII antibodies resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in clot strength (63%) compared with plasma without antibodies. Further samples exposed to anti-FXIII antibodies had clot strength no different from FXIII-deficient plasma. The FXIII-mediated clot strength varied between 44 and 50% in hypercoagulable and hypocoagulable plasma, respectively. In conclusion, the present investigation successfully demonstrated a novel method to detect the impact of FXIII activity in plasma samples. Further actuarial investigation will be required to determine the utility of this approach in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with either acquired FXIII deficiency or excess and concordant coagulopathy."

From February 2002 to July 2002, nine patients--five males (55.5%) and four females (44.4%), age 47-70 yr (median 56)--underwent 12 courses (4-7 sessions each) of MARS. Patients were treated for the following indications: six (66.6%) acute-on-chronic hepatic failure, three (33.3%) intractable pruritus. Platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), international standardized ratio and thromboelastography were measured before and after each MARS session. Coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, von Willebrand, lupus anticoagulant, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, plasminogen, alpha 2 antiplasmin, D-dimer, fibrin monomers, complement, and C(1) inactivator were measured before and at the end of each MARS treatment. We found a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in the platelet count, PT, all the thromboelastograph variables (reaction and constant time, alpha angle, and maximal amplitude), factor VIII, von Willebrand, and D-dimer, when measured before and after MARS. Previous reports have shown amelioration of blood coagulation following MARS treatments. However, we document that MARS induces coagulopathy through a platelet-mediated mechanism, whereby platelet may be mechanically destroyed during the passage of blood through the filters and lines. An alternative postulated mechanism is an immune-mediated platelet disruption - coagulopathy."

In patients of the II and III group thrombogenic hypercoagulant tendencies compared to that of the young age were more distinct and were mainly conditioned by depressions of the anticoagulative link in the anticoagulant blood system. In patients younger than 45, despite more rapid formation of procoagulants, there was an earlier and more expressed activation of fibrinolysis and an increase of the concentration of free heparin in the blood. These changes of coagulation in an ischemic stroke have a compensatory significance and can be explained by a prevalent adaptive tendency of changes in metabolism in young age, providing an adaptation of the organism in the period of stress."

This includes the important testing of the hemostatic function of platelets. So far, mostly platelet aggregation analyses have been performed. In this study, new approaches were tested to evaluate the applicability of modern techniques for quality monitoring. Plateletpheresis was performed with two different cell separators (AMICUS cell separator, Fenwal, Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, USA; COBE Spectra, COBE BCT, Lakewood, USA). In each procedure split products (n = 22) were prepared and stored for 1-2 days (n = 22) or 3 5 days (n = 22). Platelet hemostatic capacity was tested by applying flow cytometry. platelet aggregation (platelet-rich-plasma [PRP]+agonist), resonance thrombography (RTG; PRP, no agonist) and rotational thrombelastography (roTEG; PRP+agonist). Flow cytometric analyses did not reveal significant changes in structural (CD41a. CD42b) or activation-dependent antigens (CD62p, CD63, LIBS, RIBS). Also, differences in the data from the flow cytometric reactivity tests were not significant between the two groups. In platelet aggregation assays, shape change (p = 0.8), maximum aggregation (p = 0.4), and maximum gradient (p = 0.8) did not show significant differences between the two groups. In the RTG test, differences between r-time (reaction time; p = 0.4), and f-time (clot formation time [fibrin influence]; p = 0.3), and in roTEG r-time (coagulation time; p = 0.1) and k-time (clot formation time; p = 1.0) were not significant. P-time (clot formation time [platelet influence]) and M (maximum amplitude) in RTG, and k-time and MA (maximum amplitude) in roTEG showed a slight decrease in platelet function (p < or = 0.05). We conclude that platelet function is well maintained during storage. This is reflected by the results of immunological and platelet function assays. Rotational thrombelastography (in the case of PRP) and especially resonance thrombography represent promising methods for quality control of platelet concentrates and rapidly provide information about the status of platelet function and the whole clotting process."

CD010438,0,20109654,0,"Results of an international, multicentre pharmacokinetic trial in congenital fibrinogen deficiency.","Rare bleeding disorders represent 3-5% of all inherited coagulation factor disorders. Inherited afibrinogenemia, which is caused by a deficiency in plasma fibrinogen (coagulation factor I), accounts for only a small portion of all the rare bleeding disorders. Patients with afibrinogenemia have a variable bleeding pattern that may include potentially serious or life-threatening haemorrhages. Treatment of afibrinogenemia is aimed at replacing the missing fibrinogen to restore efficient haemostasis and to stop bleeding. Three sources of fibrinogen are currently available: fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and lyophilized fibrinogen concentrate. Owing to its rarity, little is known about the optimal treatment of patients with afibrinogenemia, including the pharmacokinetics of fibrinogen concentrate. To explore this further, we conducted a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, multinational pharmacokinetic trial of pasteurized human fibrinogen concentrate in 15 patients with afibrinogenemia. Infusion of a single dose of fibrinogen concentrate (70 mg/kg body weight) resulted in similar fibrinogen antigen and activity levels, which were highly correlated. Fibrinogen levels rose rapidly following infusion to reach a maximum of approximately 1.3 g/L at 1 hour. Fibrinogen concentrate effectively restored clot formation, based on the surrogate thromboelastographic end-point of maximum clot firmness.

The present study investigates the effect of sample anticoagulant on the response of a colloid induced dilutional coagulopathy model to recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) as measured by thrombelastography. Thrombelastographic evaluation of whole blood coagulation activated with minute amounts of tissue factor in a model of in vitro haemodilution with hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 in a prospective laboratory study. Whole blood coagulation was evaluated before and after 30% dilution with HES 130/0.4, and following in vitro addition of rFVIIa to whole blood collected into tubes containing citrate, corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI), and no stabilizers. Haemodilution with HES 130/0.4 induces a coagulopathy characterised by a reduced maximum rate of clot formation and a pronounced reduction in the final clot firmness. With all test mediums investigated, rFVIIa significantly shortened clot initiation phase. In cases of native whole blood and CTI-stabilised whole blood, rFVIIa shortens the clotting time but also demonstrated an acceleration of the maximum velocity of clot formation. When citrate is used as anticoagulants in thrombelastographic clotting assays, these may artificially mask the haemostatic effect of rFVIIa in colloid haemodilution. The effect in vitro of rFVIIa in citrated blood samples may underestimate the haemostatic potential of rFVIIa."

Near-patient diagnostic methods are available for the management of this coagulopathy and for the guidance of the therapeutic options with blood products and haemostatic drugs: conventional laboratory analysis methods adapted to the point-of-care (POC) situation (blood gas analysis, point of care PT, APTT and platelet count), and the complex whole blood methods used for near-patient coagulation monitoring (thromboelastometry and platelet function analysis). Based on the new Guidelines of the German Medical Association for the use of blood and plasma derivates, interventions with blood products and haemostatic drugs in multiple trauma patients are suggested. The diagnostic value of near-patient methods for coagulation monitoring is discussed."

CD010438,0,3151765,0,Coagulopathy in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Korea (Korean hemorrhagic fever) is an acute viral disease characterized by fever, hemorrhage and renal failure. In Korean patients, the disease manifests more distinctive bleeding tendencies than those of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome found in western countries. To investigate the nature and role of the coagulation, fibrinolysis, kinin and immune system in the pathogenesis of such a hemorrhagic manifestation, alterations of these systems were assessed from the early phase of the disease. Decreased platelet count and shortened platelet survival were observed with giant platelets in the peripheral blood. The marked prolongations of bleeding time, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were noticed with the decreased plasma activities of coagulation factors II, V, VIII, IX and X. Shortened half life of fibrinogen, increased fibrinogen-fibrin degradation product, with decreased plasma levels and activities of plasminogen, alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor and antithrombin III were found. On thrombelastogram, the existence of procoagulant activity was confirmed, and prolonged reaction time and clot formation time with decreased maximum amplitude were observed. The appearance of circulating immune complexes was found along with decreased C3 and normal C4 in the serum. Significant decrease of serum C3 was evident in the patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation. These findings of coagulopathy were normalized within ten days of the illness in most cases. Therefore, it can be concluded that disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombocytopenia in the early phase, and azotemia developing later might play an important role in the pathogenesis of bleeding tendency in Korean hemorrhagic fever."

Blood samples were obtained at induction from 40 adult elective cardiothoracic surgical patients who had received 5000 IU unfractionated heparin subcutaneously within six hours. Simultaneous kaolin and heparinase-modified thrombelastographies were run on all samples. Fourteen patients (35%; 95% CI: 20 to 50%) had a demonstrable heparin effect (defined as a kaolin thrombelastography R time >25% longer than the heparinase-modified control). Their mean +/- SD kaolin thrombelastography R time was 13.6 +/- 5.9 minutes (normal range 4 to 8 minutes) vs. 7.1 +/- 2.0 minutes for the heparinase-modified controls. In 10 patients the thrombelastography R times were >50% longer and in four patients >100% longer than their respective heparinase-modified controls. In a post hoc analysis, there was little correlation between the extent of the prolongation and patient age (r = 0.02), weight (r = -0.31), preoperative creatinine (r = -0.17), or time since administration of heparin (r = 0.14). These results indicate that about one third of patients who have received low-dose unfractionated heparin subcutaneously within six hours have a demonstrable heparin effect. The potential for this effect should be considered if central neural blockade is planned."

CD010438,0,1477269,0,[Physical mechanisms of solid-protein interactions in the interface between amorphous silicon carbide and fibrinogen].,"State of the art in biomaterial research and implant design is a compromise between functionality and biocompatibility. Consequently the results often have disadvantages with respect to both aspects. In regard to biocompatibility the activation of the clotting system by alloplastic materials is of great significance, because it necessitates anticoagulant therapy. Further improvements of implant technology require an understanding of the interactions between blood and implants. Therefore a microscopic model of thrombogenesis at alloplastic surfaces will shortly be presented, which relates thrombogenicity of a material to the electronic structure of its surface. The requirements for high hemocompatibility, which result from this model--especially in regard to the density of states and the conductivity at the surface--are fulfilled by an amorphous alloy of silicon and carbon (a-SiC:H). The advantage of amorphous materials is that they do not obey stoichiometric rules. Thus they allow a continuous adjustment of the electronic parameters without fundamental changes of their mechanical and chemical properties. The theoretical results where checked by total internal reflection intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy (TIRIF) as well as thrombelastography experiments (TEG). In comparison to conventional materials like titanium or LTI carbon the TEG-clotting time of a-SiC:H-coatings is prolonged in excess of 200%. As a consequence a-SiC:H is well suited as a hemocompatible coating material for hybrid structuring of cardiovascular implants."

Compared to conventional centrifugation of blood bags, the plasma separation machines led to an only slight activation of the coagulation system, which seems to be negligible for donors as well as recipients. Furthermore, a decrease of coagulation factors and inhibitors in the collected plasma was most pronounced using bag centrifugation. Beyond this, particularly in apheresis systems with plasma filtration the low number of remaining cells meets the aim to reach a high quality of transfused plasma."

CD010438,0,1450184,0,Increased lipid binding to thrombi in coronary artery disease. Findings in patients without premedication in native (not anticoagulated) test systems.,"Thrombi and clots were produced from native (i.e., not anticoagulated) platelet-rich and platelet-poor plasma from patients with coronary artery disease and control subjects who had not taken any medication known to influence plasma lipids, coagulation, or platelet aggregation. The clotting times were recorded, and the lipid content of clots, thrombi, platelets, plasma, and high density lipoprotein was analyzed. Thrombi produced from native platelet-rich plasma were 46% heavier in coronary artery disease patients and contained about 20% more phospholipids and free cholesterol and about twice the amount of triglycerides and esterified cholesterol in both absolute and relative amounts with respect to the corresponding lipids of plasma plus platelets. The elevated content of lipids not only increases the size of the thrombi but also changes their quality because of an increased content in plasmatic lipids, as platelets contain only trace amounts of triglycerides and cholesterol esters. In agreement herewith, fibrinogen and maximal amplitude on the thrombelastogram were increased in coronary artery disease patients, whereas the thrombus-forming time and clotting times of platelet-poor and platelet-rich plasma were shortened, indicating accelerated coagulation and activation of platelets. Analysis of these results suggests a disturbed interrelation in coronary artery disease between lipids and hemostasis, in which platelets, high density lipoprotein, and lipoproteins rich in triglycerides and cholesterol esters may play a role."

We found that separation of platelet activation, as assessed by platelet aggregation, from that needed to form viscoelastic stable whole blood thrombi, occurred. In normal human blood, ristocetin and collagen aggregated platelets, but did not induce strong viscoelastic thrombi. However, ADP, arachidonic acid, thrombin, and protease-activated-receptor-1 and -4 agonists, stimulated both processes. During this study, we identified the genetic basis of a very rare double heterozygous GP1b deficiency in a BSS patient, along with a new homozygous GP1b inactivating mutation in another BSS patient. In BSS whole blood, ADP responsiveness, as measured by thrombus strength, was diminished, while ADP-induced platelet aggregation was normal. Further, the platelets of 3 additional GT patients showed very weak whole blood platelet aggregation toward the above agonists and provided whole blood thrombi of very low viscoelastic strength. These results indicate that measurements of platelet counts and platelet aggregability do not necessarily correlate with generation of stable thrombi, a potentially significant feature in patient clinical outcomes."

We investigated interactions between the soy isoflavone, genistein, and an antiestrogen, tamoxifen (TAM), on the growth of estrogen (E)-dependent breast cancer (MCF-7) cells implanted in ovariectomized athymic mice. We hypothesized that weakly estrogenic genistein negate/overwhelm the inhibitory effect of TAM on the growth of E-dependent breast tumors. Six treatment groups were used: control (C); 0.25 mg estradiol (E2) implant (E); E2 implant + 2.5 mg TAM implant (2.5 TE); E2 implant + 2.5 mg TAM implant + 1000 ppm genistein (2.5 TEG); E2 implant + 5 mg TAM implant (5 TE), and E2 implant +5 mg TAM implant +1000 ppm genistein (5 TEG). Treatment with TAM (2.5 TE and 5 TE) suppressed E2-stimulated MCF-7 tumor growth in ovariectomized athymic mice. Dietary genistein negated/overwhelmed the inhibitory effect of TAM on MCF-7 tumor growth, lowered E2 level in plasma, and increased expression of E-responsive genes (e.g., pS2, PR, and cyclin D1). Therefore, caution is warranted for postmenopausal women consuming dietary genistein while on TAM therapy for E-responsive breast cancer."

Risks of human plasma-derived FXI replacement products include transfusion transmitted infection, thrombosis and fluid overload. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is an effective haemostatic agent in patients with FXI deficiency undergoing surgery. Fourteen FXI deficient patients [five severely deficient (FXI:C <20 U dL(-1)) and nine partially deficient (FXI:C 20-70 U dL(-1)] received rFVIIa to prevent surgical bleeding during five major, four minor and six dental procedures. Minor surgical and dental procedures were covered with two doses of rFVIIa (90 microg kg(-1) i.v.), the first pre-operatively and the second 4 h postoperatively. Major surgery was covered with 90 microg kg(-1) i.v. two hourly for the first 24 h and four hourly for the second 24 h. Oral tranexamic acid was given for 7 days postoperatively. Effective haemostasis was observed in all cases and no alternative haemostatic agents or blood transfusions were required. Three adverse events were recorded; an acute cerebrovascular accident in a patient with a history of cardiovascular disease, an allergic reaction and local phlebitis. In this study, rFVIIa was an effective alternative to plasma-derived FXI replacement for the prevention of surgical bleeding in FXI deficient patients but rFVIIa may not be suitable for patients with pre-existing risk factors for thrombosis."

CD010438,0,64604,0,New neonatal problems of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. I. The change of plasmin inhibitor levels in the newborn infant.,"""Hemorrhage in the newborn"" has long been recognized as merely a result of vitamin K deficiency. However, it is also recognized that fibrinolysis, especially the correlation between the plasminogen-activator and plasmin-inhibitors, play an important role in this disease during the neonatal period. With this in mind, we compared thromboelastograms (TEG) from samples with and without urokinase (plasminogen-activator). In 13 out of 15 newborn infant blood-samples (prior to and after addition of urokinase) the thromboelastogram showed the pattern of a consumption coagulopathy. The change in the concentration of plasmin-inhibitor during the neonatal period was also measured using alpha2-macroglobulin, alpha1-antitrypsin and antithrombin III with M-partigen-plates. The value of alpha2-macroglobulin showed normal adult levels but the value of alpha1-antitrypsin and antithrombin III did not even reach half of the adult level. During the newborn period, the plasmin-inhibitor shows a remarkable lowering tendency and it may be surmised that with such a lowering tendency plasmin-inhibitor may constitute an exceptionally large handicap when the activator is working. This is especially true in the case of lung hemorrhage since the activator arises from a severe pathological state in the lungs and in addition because this is complicated by the lowering of plasmin-inhibitor. These results indicate that the low level of plasmin-inhibitors work synergistically with the high value of activator. The low level of antithrombin III could be the reason for coagulation disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, (DIC)."

CD010438,0,19308889,0,Milestones and perspectives in coagulation and hemostasis.,"Hemostasis is traditionally defined as the physiologic process whereby bleeding is antagonized and possibly stopped to minimize blood loss. The first medical description of the clinical and inherited features of hemostasis can be dated back more than 1000 years, when Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn 'Abbas al-Andalusi al-Zahrawi' medical treatise provided some initial insights into this puzzling process. Since then, continuous and revolutionary scientific developments have contributed to decoding several aspects of this intricate but essential physiologic phenomenon, providing a reliable model to explain the leading mechanisms involved. Although the point at which bleeding stops is commonly referred to as ""coagulation,"" blood coagulation is actually only one part of a two-part hemostatic process that develops through sequential steps referred to as primary and secondary hemostasis. Throughout its activation and development, the coagulation cascade is strictly regulated by a series of natural inhibitors, which prevent unnecessary and excessive clotting. The aim of this article is to provide a concise overview of the major discoveries and past and current perspectives in coagulation and hemostasis."

Bleeding diathesis in these conditions is often attributed to reduced thrombin generation, which may be improved with rFVIIa. Normally, thrombin that diffuses from local vascular injury sites is quickly inactivated by antithrombin (AT). Evaluating the influence of AT levels on thrombin generation in hypocoagulable FVIII-deficient plasma would be a simple approach to better understand how procoagulant stimuli, such as rFVIIa, might result in postoperative thrombotic complications. We hypothesize that reduced AT concentrations would increase the procoagulant effects of rFVIIa in FVIII-deficient plasma."

CD010438,0,19192750,0,Effects of modified ultrafiltration on coagulation as measured by the thromboelastograph.,"Hemodilution during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) continues to be a cause of morbidity associated with coagulation dysfunction, bleeding, and allogeneic blood transfusion. Clot formation and strength have been shown to impact bleeding and transfusions. Strategies to reduce hemodilution may be negated based on the course of the cardiac procedure itself. Modified ultrafiltration (MUF) is commonly used in pediatric cardiac surgery; however, it is not well accepted in adult surgery. This study aimed to evaluate clot formation and strength, bleeding, and transfusions in adult subjects undergoing MUF. Nineteen subjects having primary coronary artery bypass, aortic, or mitral valve surgeries were recruited and randomized to having MUF (n = 10) or no-MUF (n = 9) performed after the termination of CPB. Five time points for data collection were designated: T1, baseline/induction; T2, termination CPB; T3, post-MUF; T4, post-protamine; T5, 24 hours postoperative. Subjects randomized to MUF had 1505 +/- 15.8 mL of effluent removed, and no-MUF subjects had the CPB remnants processed with a cell salvage device. There was no statistical difference seen in 24-hour chest tube output, thromboelastograph values, or allogeneic transfusions at any time point between MUF and no-MUF subjects. There was a significant difference between MUF and no-MUF in the number of autologous cell salvage units processed (1.3 +/- .48 vs. 2.9 +/- .78, p = .0013) and end of procedure net fluid balance (+2003 +/- 1211 vs. +4194 +/- 1276 mL, p = .001), respectively. Estimated plasma loss from the cell salvage device was 477.6 mL greater in the no-MUF group. In primary adult cardiac procedures, MUF did not change coagulation values as measured by thromboelastography, number of allogeneic unit transfusions, or chest tube output at 24 hours postoperatively. There was a significant difference in autologous cell salvage units processed and end of procedure net fluid balance that benefited MUF subjects."
CD010438,0,18277134,0,Effects of recombinant activated factor VII on thrombin-mediated feedback activation of coagulation.,"Thrombin is a key hemostatic enzyme, which propagates its own generation by activating factors V, VIII, and XI. Sustained thrombin generation also activates thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), which stabilizes fibrin clot against fibrinolysis. Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is considered a novel hemostatic intervention for refractory bleeding, but rebleeding episodes related to fibrinolysis still occur. The present study aimed to investigate the antifibrinolytic effects of rFVIIa in relation to thrombin generation. Using thrombelastography, the effects of rFVIIa on thrombin-activated fibrin formation and on fibrinolysis induced by tissue plasminogen activator were evaluated in various factor-deficient plasma samples. A Thrombinoscope was used to quantitate thrombin generation. Thrombin increased antifibrinolytic activity in a concentration-dependent manner as demonstrated by a longer clot lysis time. In plasma deficient in factors V, VIII, IX, X, or XI, clot lysis occurred early (< 20 min), and rFVIIa addition had minimal effect, except for improved antifibrinolytic effect in factor-XI-deficient plasma. A normal clot lysis time was observed in factor-XIII-deficient or dual antithrombin/factor-VIII-deficient plasma. Inhibition of TAFI increased the rate of fibrinolysis. Thrombin generation was delayed or decreased in single factor-deficient plasma except for factor XIII deficiency. After rFVIIa addition, the peak thrombin generation reached over 100 nmol/l in factor-XI-deficient plasma, but not in plasma deficient in factors V, VIII, IX, or X. Thrombin generation and subsequent activation of TAFI were important for clot stability. We conclude that rFVIIa therapy does not compensate for increased susceptibility to fibrinolysis due to lack of factor(s) necessary for the formation of tenase and prothrombinase."

CD010438,0,5564395,0,"Functional evaluation of an inherited abnormal fibrinogen: fibrinogen ""Baltimore"".","The rate of clotting and the rate of development and degree of turbidity after addition of thrombin to plasma or purified fibrinogen from a patient with fibrinogen Baltimore was delayed when compared with normal, especially in the presence of low concentrations of thrombin. Optimal coagulation and development of translucent, rather than opaque, clots occurred at a lower pH with the abnormal fibrinogen than with normal. Development of turbidity during clotting of the abnormal plasma or fibrinogen was less than normal at each pH tested, but was maximal in both at approximately pH 6.4. The physical quality of clots formed from fibrinogen Baltimore was abnormal, as demonstrated by a decreased amplitude on thromboelastography. The morphologic appearance of fibrin strands formed from fibrinogen Baltimore by thrombin at pH 7.4 was abnormal when examined by phase contrast or electron microscopy, but those formed by thrombin at pH 6.4 or by thrombin and calcium chloride were similar to, though less compact, than normal fibrin. The periodicity of fibrin formed from fibrinogen Baltimore was similar to normal and was 231-233 A.A study of the release of the fibrinopeptides from the patient's fibrinogen and its chromatographic subfractions verified the existence of both a normally behaving and a defective form of fibrinogen in the patient's plasma. The defective form differed from normal in three functionally different ways: (a) the rate of release of fibrinopeptides A and AP was slower than normal; (b) no visible clot formation accompanied either partial or complete release of the fibrinopeptides from the defective form in 0.3 M NaCl at pH 7.4; and (c) the defective component possessed a high proportion of phosphorylated, relative to nonphosphorylated, fibrinopeptide A, while the coagulable component contained very little of the phosphorylated peptide (AP). The high phosphate content of the defective component did not appear to be the cause of the abnormality, but may be the result of an associated metabolic or genetic phenomenon."
CD010438,0,11004032,0,The effect of hydroxyethyl starch 200 kD on platelet function.,"We evaluated the effects of hydroxyethyl starch with a molecular weight of 200 kD (HES 200 kD) on platelets to gain insight into the potential mechanisms involved in the anticoagulant effects of HES 200 kD. Blood was obtained before and after an IV infusion (10 mL/kg) of either saline (n = 15) or HES 200 kD (n = 15) in otherwise healthy patients scheduled for minor elective surgery. Flow cytometry was used to assess the expression of glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa, GP Ib, and P-selectin on agonist-activated platelets. Overall platelet function was evaluated by assessing thromboelastographic maximum amplitude (MA) in celite-activated blood and platelet function analyzer-closure times by using collagen/adenosine diphosphate cartridges. Saline infusion had no effects on platelet variables, whereas HES 200 kD reduced GP IIb-IIIa expression and MA and prolonged platelet function analyzer-closure times, without affecting the expression of P-selectin and GP Ib. In vitro experiments extended these observations by a concentration-related inhibiting effect of HES 200 kD on GP IIb-IIIa expression. This study demonstrates that cellular abnormalities with decreased availability of platelet GP IIb-IIIa are involved in the anticoagulant effects of HES 200 kD."
CD010438,0,14524031,0,[The value of platelet function tests].,"Platelet function tests are used to detect patients with abnormal platelet function, which may be inborn or acquired or to detect increased platelet activation which may be accompanied by an increased risk of thrombosis. Platelet function tests are also used to monitor platelet function inhibitors as aspirin, clopidogrel or platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa-inhibitors. Incorrect blood sampling is a major source of error in measuring platelet function. Global tests besides platelet count and bleeding time are thrombelastography, the platelet function analyzer (PFA) and possibly in the future the new Impact-system. Specific tests measure platelet spreading and adhesion to defined surfaces. In a series of methods platelets are counted before and after passage of a filter. Some of these tests are partially standardized. The most frequently measured platelet function is aggregation induced by ADP, collagen or other substances as first described by Gustav Born. Some newer methods to perform aggregometry are described. Platelet activation can be detected by measuring spontaneous aggregation as in the PAT-test. Prospective trials with this test have shown that enhanced spontaneous aggregation is a risk factor for new vascular occlusions in diabetics and for myocardial infarctions in healthy individuals. The Wu and Hoak-test and the measurement of released platelet factor 4 or betaglobulin are of limited value. Flow cytometric methods are frequently used to measure platelet activation markers as CD 62 and others. Platelet induced thrombin generation is an interesting function to measure drug effects. None of the presently available platelet function tests is well standardized, so there is much room for improvement."

CD010438,0,17562614,0,Factor VIII-mediated global hemostasis in the absence of von Willebrand factor.,"Although the efficacy of recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) in the treatment of type 3 von Willebrand disease (VWD) has been reported, the mechanisms by which FVIII concentrates devoid of von Willebrand factor (VWF) induce improvements in hemostasis are poorly understood. To address the role of FVIII or intrinsic coagulation in the absence of VWF, we performed a hemostatic analysis. Blood samples were obtained before and after the administration of rFVIII to 2 patients with type 3 VWD. A rotating thromboelastometry assay was performed to examine global interactions in hemostasis. Studies of thrombin-and shear-induced platelet aggregation were also conducted to elucidate the effect on platelet activation. Furthermore, we assessed the rise in the thrombin-induced intracellular concentration of free calcium [Ca2+]i. Addition of rFVIII to preinfusion blood in vitro corrected thromboelastometric parameters and thrombin-induced aggregation. In ex vivo studies, thromboelastometry analysis showed that rFVIII shortened the onset and progression of the coagulation process. Furthermore, rFVIII corrected low shear-induced and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma. In addition, rFVIII improved thrombin-induced [Ca2+]i flux in washed platelets. Our observations suggested that FVIII is incorporated into platelets to activate them, as well as to act directly in intrinsic coagulation in the absence of VWF. FVIII may play a critical role even in the absence of VWF."

CD010438,0,17111420,0,Comparison of plateletpheresis on the Fresenius AS.TEC 204 and Haemonetics MCS 3p.,"This is an attempt at comparing two cell separators for plateletpheresis, namely the Fresenius AS.TEC 204 and Haemonetics MCS 3p, at a tertiary care center in India. Donors who weighed between 55-75 kg, who had a hematocrit of 41-43%, and platelet counts of 250x10(3)-400x10(3)/microl were selected for the study. The comparability of the donors who donated on the two cell separators were analysed by t-test independent samples and no significant differences were found (P>0.05). The features compared were time taken for the procedure, volume processed on the separators, adverse reactions of the donors, quality control of the product, separation efficiency of the separators, platelet loss in the donors after the procedure, and the predictor versus the actual yield of platelets given by the cell separator. The volume processed to get a target yield of >3x10(11) was equal to 2.8-3.2 l and equal in both the cell separators. Symptoms of citrate toxicity were seen in 4 and 2.5% of donors who donated on the MCS 3p and the AS.TEC 204, respectively, and 3 and 1% of donors, respectively, had vasovagal reactions. All the platelet products collected had a platelet count of >3x10(11); 90% of the platelet products collected on the AS.TEC 204 attained the predicted yield that was set on the cell separator where as 75% of the platelet products collected on the MCS 3p attained the target yield. Quality control of the platelets collected on both the cell separators complied with the standards except that 3% of the platelets collected on the MCS 3p had a visible red cell contamination. The separation efficiency of the MCS 3p was higher, 50-52% as compared to the 40-45% on the AS.TEC 204. A provision of double venous access, less adverse reactions, negligible RBC contamination with a better predictor yield of platelets makes the AS.TEC 204 a safer and more reliable alternative than the widely used Haemonetics MCS 3p."

Starting with an impaired fibrinogen (1.04 g x l(-1)) and factor XIII level (48%), fibrinogen and factor XIII administration was guided by point-of-care rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) to achieve normal whole blood coagulation, which allowed uncomplicated spinal anaesthesia and an uneventful surgical procedure.

CD010438,0,15271723,0,Changes in thrombelastograph variables associated with aging.,"Aging is associated with hypercoagulability. To assess thrombelastography (TEG) variables associated with aging, 132 adult patients of various ages undergoing orthopedic surgery for fracture repair had venous blood samples withdrawn for testing of recalcified TEG before the induction of anesthesia. Age was weakly correlated with all TEG variables: r time (R) (r = -0.45, P < 0.001; R = 19.5 - 0.09 x age), k time (K) (r = -0.49, P < 0.001; K = 6.5 - 0.04 x age), maximum amplitude (MA) (r = 0.25, P < 0.01; MA = 53.3 + 0.07 x age), and alpha (r = 0.52, P < 0.001; alpha = 52.8 + 0.2 x age). The correlation was stronger for men than for women. Only R was significantly correlated with age when the women were separately analyzed. Part of the correlation may be attributable to a concurrent decrease in hemoglobin with aging, but age remained an independent predictor of R, K, and alpha on forward stepwise linear multiple regression analysis. Aging was weakly associated with changes in TEG variables, which should be allowed for when interpreting TEG measurements in the elderly."
CD010438,0,10228839,0,Thrombelastographic patterns during cryotherapy for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma.,"A cirrhotic patient with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma and thrombocytopenia undergoing cryotherapy showed: 1) transient hyperfibrinolysis shortly after platelet transfusion, and 2) evidence of activation of coagulation after freezing and thawing of tumor as measured on the thrombelastography. No anti-fibrinolytic treatment was required for the hyperfibrinolysis which subsided spontaneously in this patient. This case report highlights that: 1) in patients with chronic liver disease, platelet transfusion might potentially worsen rather than improve the hemostatic function by activation of fibrinolysis, and 2) activation of coagulation may underlie the perioperative coagulation changes seen in cryotherapy."

CD010438,0,4035364,0,A primate model (Macaca mulatta) to study the pharmacokinetics of heparin and its fractions.,"We have extensively studied the hemostatic parameters and the responses to the anticoagulant action of heparin and its fractions in the primate model (M. mulatta) and found these to be identical to those obtained in humans. The functional properties of antithrombin III, alpha 2-antiplasmin, and platelet factor 4 were also identical to humans in amidolytic and coagulant assays. Human antibodies against FPA, B beta 15-42 peptide, platelet factor 4, and thromboxane B2 reacted with the primate antigen, and assays were developed to measure these parameters in primates. Infusion of activated prothrombin complex concentrates (more than 100 U/kg/day) on a continual basis up to 3 days resulted in a hypercoagulable state manifested by an elevation of FPA, thromboxane B2, and changes in the thrombelastographic patterns. Similarly, infusion of homologous primate serum also resulted in a hypercoagulable state, as was evident by a sharp increase in the FPA levels. The antithrombotic effects of intravenous and subcutaneous administration of heparin, its low molecular fraction, and their constituents were studied after intravenous and subcutaneous injections. The low molecular weight fractions showed the most effective antithrombotic effects, whereas somewhat milder protection was observed with the starting material and highly anionic fraction. The prolongation of global tests, such as the APTT, TT, and changes in the thromboelastogram did not correlate with the reduction in the blood markers of hypercoagulable state. A modified simplate bleeding time method was used to study the effect of heparin and its fractions on the bleeding profile of heparin fractions. The components of fibrinolytic systems were also measurable in both the clot-based and amidolytic methods to predict the profibrinolytic actions of heparin fractions in its mode. These studies suggest that plasma markers, such as the platelet release proteins, products of thrombin activation, and prostaglandin metabolites, may provide better indices in the monitoring of the antithrombotic actions of newer heparins and antithrombotic drugs. Studies suggest that the pathophysiologic responses after a thrombogenic trigger in the primate model are close to humans, and drug modulation of these may provide relevant clinical information. This model provides the most similar preclinical model to study the actions of heparin fractions."

CD010438,0,1370735,0,Different aprotinin applications influencing hemostatic changes in orthotopic liver transplantation.,"The effect of different aprotinin applications on hemostatic changes and blood product requirements in orthotopic liver transplantation was investigated in a prospective, open, and randomized study. From November 1989 to June 1990, 13 patients received aprotinin as a bolus of 0.5 Mill. Kallikrein inactivator units (KIU) on three occasions in the course of an OLT, whereas 10 other patients were treated with continuous aprotinin infusion of 0.1-0.4 Mill. KIU/hr. Before and after reperfusion of the graft liver, signs of hyperfibrinolysis, measured by thrombelastography, were significantly lower in the infusion group. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity increased during the anhepatic phase but to a significantly lesser extent in the infusion group. Blood product requirements during OLT were tendentiously higher in the bolus group but not significantly so. However, the use of packed red blood cells was significantly lower in the postoperative period, whereas there was no significant difference in fresh frozen plasma requirements between the two groups. All 23 patients have survived, and only one woman of each group required retransplantation due to severe host-versus-graft reactions. Furthermore, we investigated the perfusate of the graft liver in both groups and detected signs of a decreased t-PA release in the infusion group. Our results demonstrate an advantage of aprotinin given as continuous infusion over bolus application in OLT."
CD010438,0,21217484,0,Multiple levels of degradation diminish hemostatic potential of thawed plasma.,"Severe bleeding after injury requires transfusion of blood products, including fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Many centers are keeping thawed plasma (TP) ready for massively transfused patients. According to the American Association of Blood Banks Standards, TP is approved for transfusion up to 5 days after thawing, when stored at 1°C to 6°C. However, there are no clinical data analyzing the effects of the approved 5-day storage on plasma. We hypothesize that the hemostatic potential (HP) of freshly thawed (FFP-0) was superior to plasma stored for 5 days (FFP-5)."
CD010438,0,17413761,0,A comparison of the Thrombelastograph and the ROTEM.,"Elastic modulus-based assessment of hemostasis in clinical and research settings has been conducted for nearly 60 years. Two systems utilizing this technology include the Thrombelastograph (Haemoscope Corporation, Niles, Illinois, USA) and the ROTEM (Pentapharm GmbH, Munich, Germany). The study goal was to compare the Thrombelastograph and the ROTEM to determine whether differences in data could be detected. Plasma (n = 8 per condition) was not activated (native); was celite-activated, hypocoagulable by dilution with hydroxyethyl starch; was celite-activated, normal; and was celite-activated, hypercoagulable by addition of fibrinogen. Equivalent ratios of plasma mixture to CaCl2 were maintained between the Thrombelastograph and ROTEM systems. Data collected included the reaction time, angle, maximum amplitude and maximum elastic modulus. The ROTEM system generated significantly (P<0.05) smaller reaction time (mean +/- SD, 459 +/- 39 versus 788 +/- 94 s) and greater angle (60.1 +/- 5.3 versus 46.4 +/- 4.6 degrees ), maximum amplitude (27.6 +/- 1.6 versus 24.4 +/- 1.4 mm) and maximum elastic modulus (1911 +/- 152 versus 1616 +/- 121 dynes/cm2) values with native plasma compared with the Thrombelastograph. Celite-activation tended to attenuate differences between the two systems. In conclusion, a comparison of the Thrombelastograph and the ROTEM with similar samples demonstrated clinically significant differences in the data generated without exogenous activation. Given these data and the differences in proprietary activator, divergent results are expected, perhaps affecting clinical decision-making."

It remains controversial whether patients with the JAK2 V617F mutation (V617F) exhibit increased risk, while recent growing evidence has shown a critical role for V617F in clonal erythropoiesis in Ph-MPD. We studied 53 patients with Ph-MPD especially in relation to megakaryopoiesis, the thrombotic complications and the presence of V617F. Using novel mutation-specific PCR which is a highly sensitive PCR-based assay for detection of JAK2 mutated allele(s), we identified V617F in 38 Ph-MPD, which include 13 polycythemia vera (PV), 23 essential thrombocythemia (ET) and 2 chronic idiopatic myelofibrosis. The numbers of megakaryocytes were significantly increased in PV and ET patients with V617F, but the platelet counts were slightly lower. Although statistically not significant, the incidence of thrombotic events was higher in the group with V617F compared to in those without the mutation. Agonist-induced in vitro platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion were not affected by the presence of this mutation. Nonetheless, we found a hypercoagulable state in Ph-CMPD with V617F by employing whole blood thromboelastography. It suggests pre-thrombotic tendencies in CMPD are complex and JAK2 V617F mutation might have a role in vivo blood coagulation by altering not only the number, but function(s) of all three myeloid cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in Ph-CMPD."
CD010438,0,9263112,0,"Prospective, concurrent comparison of the Cobe Spectra and Haemonetics MCS-3P cell separators for leukapheresis after high-dose filgrastim in patients with hematologic malignancies.","A prospective study was undertaken to compare the mononuclear cell, CD34+ cell, and CFU-GM yields of the Haemonetics MCS-3P and the Cobe Spectra cell separators in ten patients (nine multiple myeloma and one non-Hodgkin lymphoma) on two consecutive days after mobilization with high-dose filgrastim (12-16 micrograms/k) for 4 days. All patients were harvested once on each machine, five starting on each machine. The target duration of the procedure on the Spectra was 160 minutes, and the target blood volume processed on the MCS-3P was 60-70 ml/kg body weight. Both machines were operating on the 1995 software versions supplied by the respective manufacturers. The time taken for the procedure was significantly longer with the Haemonetics machine. The volumes of blood processed and the product collected were significantly higher with the Spectra, as were the absolute mononuclear and CD34+ cell yields, and yields per unit time. Mononuclear and CD34+ cell yields per unit volume of blood processed were comparable for both machines. The differences in CFU-GM yields were not significant, largely because of wide interpatient variations. The extent of platelet depletion as a result of the procedure was greater with the Spectra because of the higher blood volume being processed. We conclude that the Cobe Spectra is a significantly faster machine than the Haemonetics MCS-3P; and consequently, its use is associated with higher mononuclear and CD34+ cell yields."
CD010438,0,454499,0,Plasmapheresis and lymphoplasmapheresis in the management of rheumatoid arthritis.,"We have demonstrated the efficacy of therapeutic pheresis in a number of rheumatic diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Ten of 12 patients with RA went into remissions averaging 4 months. These patients were pheresed 20 times over 11 weeks in a tapering fashion on a Haemonetics Model 30 Blood Processor. Clinical remissions were sustained even though serologies, immunoglobulins, immune functions, sedimentation rates, and circulating immune complexes returned to their pre-pheresis baseline by pheresis number 20. All these patients were taking gold or D-penicillamine concurrently, but neither of the 2 patients who failed to respond was on these agents. Plasmapheresis was just as effective as lymphoplasmapheresis. It is theorized that removal of a plasma factor that modulates lymphocyte or neutrophil function produces remissions in RA and that long-acting drugs (e.g., gold or penicillamine) are able to prevent its continued production and produce a sustained remission."

To determine medical students' perception of three such media (blackboard, overhead projector, and slides), and to generate recommendations for their optimal use, a prospective questionnaire-based study was carried out among 7th semester medical students of the University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi. Students made a forced choice between: (1) The three media on 8 questions regarding their advantages and disadvantages and (2) four aspects of a lecture (teaching-learning media, topic, teacher and time of day) regarding which made the lecture most engaging. Resulting data was analysed by Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Chalk and blackboard was rated as best in allowing interaction and helping recall (p<0.001 each). The overhead projector was best in providing information pointwise (p<0.001; 67 students, 89.3%, considered this an advantage). More subject matter could be covered per lecture (p=0.001; 58 students, 77.3%, considered this a disadvantage). Slides were best in imparting clinical details (p=0.004), but were sleep inducing (p<0.001). The teacher's style of instruction was most important in making the lecture engaging (p<0.001). The teacher's role in the learning process is important. Students enjoy the slow pace and interaction allowed by blackboard, pointwise information presented by the overhead projector, and the clinical details a slide can provide. The results suggest that the lecture could best be a combination of two or more teaching-learning media. Students' interaction should be encouraged whatever the media used."

However, the cause of changes in R has been influenced by the method of activation (e.g., celite) and the clinical/laboratory setting (e.g., hemodilution). Although antithrombin deficiency has been implicated as a cause of decreased R in unactivated samples after crystalloid dilution, dilution with hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions such as Hextend (6% HES solution; average molecular weight 450 kDa) or Voluven (6% HES solution; average molecular weight 130 kDa) has decreased R values in celite-activated samples in vitro and in vivo, with modulation of these R values observed after aprotinin exposure.

Consequently, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is administered to all such patients perioperatively. There is a lack of consensus in guidelines regarding the timing of administration and the dosage of thromboprophylactic agents. Studies have shown that thrombo-elastography (TEG) is a useful test in assessing global haemostatic function, and has been validated in monitoring the dosage of LMWH. In this study, we assess the coagulation status of patients undergoing thoracic surgery with TEG, and the effectiveness of administered LMWH for thromboprophylaxis."
CD010438,0,8679357,0,Haemostatic changes caused by i.v. regional anaesthesia with lignocaine.,"The various components of i.v. regional anaesthesia (IVRA), that is ischaemia, tourniquet compression and the presence of high concentrations of local anaesthetics in the blood vessels of the extremity, may affect haemostatic mechanisms. We performed a cross-over study in 10 healthy male volunteers to examine the role of lignocaine in IVRA on several haemostatic variables, and those indicating fibrinolysis and platelet function in particular. Venous blood samples were obtained from the test arm and the opposite arm before IVRA, at the time of tourniquet cuff deflation and 30 min thereafter. Metal needle punctures were used, and for the sample from the test arm at the time of cuff deflation, cuff pressure was reduced from 300 mm Hg to individual mean arterial pressure. The IVRA technique included exsanguination by arm elevation and axillary artery compression, inflation of the tourniquet cuff for 20 min and deflation of the cuff in one step (after obtaining the venous sample). Each subject received, in random order, either 0.5% lignocaine 3 mg kg-1 or the corresponding volume of saline i.v. All fibrinolysis markers, that is, D-dimer, tissue plasminogen activator antigen (t-PA antigen), tissue plasminogen activator activity (t-PA activity), plasminogen activator inhibitor activity (PAI) and protein C indicated enhanced fibrinolysis by IVRA, but only t-PA antigen and PAI showed greater changes in the lignocaine compared with the saline group in the exposed arm at the time of cuff deflation. Platelet function tests (ADP-induced platelet aggregation, beta-thromboglobulin and thrombelastogram (TEG)) indicated no differences between the lignocaine and saline groups. Although IVRA appeared to induce some platelet dysfunction, there was a small increase in TEG amplitude indicative of improved fibrin-platelet interaction in the lignocaine-exposed arm at the time of cuff deflation. We conclude that the presence of high i.v. lignocaine concentrations (median 144.4 micrograms ml-1 in cubital veins at the end of the tourniquet time) potentiated ischaemia-induced fibrinolysis activation during IVRA. Concomitant platelet dysfunction was not aggravated by lignocaine."

CD010438,0,3996457,0,Monitoring of antifibrinolytic treatment in subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"21 patients (aged 28-81 years) with recent subarachnoid hemorrhage (10 saccular aneurysms, 3 arteriovenous angiomas, 8 normal angiograms) were continuously infused with tranexamic acid at a dosage of 5 g daily for up to 14 days. Therapy was surveyed by daily measurement of the available plasminogen activity (aPl) with the chromogenic substrate S-2251 and by a modified bioassay, whereby the concentration of tranexamic acid was determined thrombelastographically and expressed as antifibrinolytic equivalent. In addition, a battery of blood coagulation tests was performed daily. 5 patients died, 1 after postoperative stroke, 3 as a result of general complications during intensive care treatment, but only 1 due to rebleeding. 4 patients were successfully operated during the first week, 1 patient after 2 weeks. aPl fell from 99.2% (SEM 3.0%, n = 21) before treatment to 72.9% (SEM 3.5%, n = 21) after 24 h and to the therapeutic level between 50 and 60% from day 2 on. The mean steady state of the antifibrinolytic equivalent corresponded to about 150 micrograms/ml of tranexamic acid during infusion. Intra- and interindividual changes were relatively small for aPl, when compared with the antifibrinolytic equivalent measured by the bioassay. In 2 elderly patients tranexamic acid infusion had to be terminated because of clinical and laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, whereby aPl fell below the therapeutic range, elucidating that this method is a sensitive indicator for a hypercoagulable state and useful for the surveillance of therapy with antifibrinoltic agents."

CD010438,0,15970714,0,Antithrombin efficiency is maintained in vitro in human plasma following dilution with hydroxyethyl starches.,"Hemodilution has been associated with changes in hemostasis secondary to modulation of procoagulant activity. However, direct effects of specific fluids on anticoagulants, such as antithrombin (AT), remained undefined. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether hemodilution with hydroxyethyl starches (HES) directly diminishes plasma AT activity, which would be manifested by decreases in clot initiation time (reaction time, R) with thrombelastography greater than that seen with 0.9% NaCl (NS). Normal plasma and AT-deficient (<1% activity) plasma were diluted 0 or 30% with NS, Hextend (6% HES; average molecular weight, 450 kDa), PentaLyte (6% HES; average molecular weight, 220 kDa), or Voluven (6% HES; average molecular weight, 130 kDa) (n=6-7 experiments per condition). Undiluted, normal plasma had an R value of 796+/-65 s, which was significantly (P<0.05) greater than R values following NS (690+/-50 s) or Voluven (675+/-68 s) dilution. R values of normal plasma diluted with Hextend (831+/-51 s) or PentaLyte (801+/-72 s) were not different from undiluted plasma but were significantly (P<0.05) greater than those observed following NS or Voluven dilution. There were no significant differences between the conditions when AT-deficient plasma was utilized (R range, 404-440 s). Rather than interfere with AT activity, HES with an average molecular weight of 220-450 kDa maintain AT efficiency."

CD010438,0,19760384,0,[Coagulation management in multiple trauma].,"More than 25% of polytraumatized patients present in the emergency department with a coagulopathy which results in a 4-fold increase in mortality. The detection of microvascular bleeding is the major clinical indicator. Measurement of fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time as well as thrombelastometry are required. A prerequisite for the substitution of coagulation factors and platelets is an immediate surgical control of bleeding and correction of hypothermia, acidosis and hypocalcemia. The goals for platelet count, fibrinogen, PT and aPTT are well established. The use of an algorithm for transfusion and coagulation management results in optimized therapy and improved outcome. Substituted coagulation products are only effective if hyperfibrinolysis has been corrected before. The administration of fibrinogen corrects the coagulation factor that is critically reduced earliest, improves global coagulation tests and reduced mortality in some studies. The dose required (3-5 g) can be calculated by a formula. Fresh frozen plasma is given in a 1:1 ratio to red blood cells or at least 20-40 ml/kg body weight. A clear advantage for survival has not yet been shown and some of the risks include insufficient substitution of fibrinogen and transfusion-related acute lung injury. Goals for the administration of platelet concentrates depend on the acuity of bleeding, injury pattern (e.g. head trauma) and clinical signs of microvascular bleeding. Factor VIIa remains an off-label rescue therapy if bleeding persists despite optimization of preconditions and specific coagulation management."
CD010438,0,11574351,0,Hemostatic changes in pediatric neurosurgical patients as evaluated by thrombelastograph.,"Thromboembolic events are a known complication in neurosurgical patients. There is evidence to suggest that a hypercoagulable state may develop perioperatively. Thrombelastograph (TEG) coagulation analysis is a reliable method of evaluating hypercoagulability. We evaluated coagulation by using TEG data in pediatric neurosurgical patients undergoing craniotomy to determine whether a hypercoagulable state develops intraoperatively or postoperatively. Thirty children undergoing craniotomy for removal of a tumor or seizure focus were studied. Blood was analyzed with TEG) data by using native and celite techniques, at three time points for each patient: preoperatively after induction of anesthesia; intraoperatively during closure of the dura; and on the first postoperative day. Compared with preoperative indices, closing and postoperative celite TEG values were indicative of hypercoagulability with shortened coagulation time values (P < 0.001), prolonged alpha angle divergence values (P < 0.001), and above-normal TEG coagulation indices (P < or = 0.002). Reaction time values were shortened, and maximal amplitude of clot strength values were prolonged but did not reach statistical significance. Hypercoagulation develops early after resection of brain tissue in pediatric neurosurgical patients as assessed by using TEG data. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of this hypercoagulable state."

Therefore patients with septicaemia were treated in some studies with polymyxin. We investigated the effect of polymyxin B and E (colistin) on some blood coagulation parameters, spreading of platelets and fibrin polymerisation. With increased concentrations of polymyxin (1, 5, 10, 20, 100 mg%) we found a significant prolongation of prothrombin, partial thromboplastin and TEG reaction times. Spreading of platelets was also reduced. There was, however, no effect on fibrin polymerisation. The coagulation inhibitory effects of polymyxins could be reduced by adding phospholipids as procoagulant. These results indicate: 1. There are anticoagulant effects of polymyxins even in therapeutic doses and therefore it should not be applied in cases of haemorrhagic diathesis or renal insufficiency. 2. In septicaemia the disseminated intravascular coagulation can be prevented because due to consumption of polymyxin, endotoxinaemia persists."

CD010438,0,17380100,0,Management of massive operative blood loss.,"Coagulopathy associated with massive operative blood loss is an intricate, multicellular and multifactorial event. Massive bleeding can either be anticipated (during major surgery with high risk of bleeding) or unexpected. Management requires preoperative risk evaluation and preoperative optimization (discontinuation or modification of anticoagulant drugs, prophylactic coagulation therapy). Intraoperatively, the causal diagnosis of the complex pathophysiology of massive bleeding requiring rapid and specific coagulation management is critical for the patient's outcome. Treatment and transfusion algorithms, based on repeated and timely point-of-care coagulation testing and on the clinical judgment, are to be encouraged. The time lapse for reporting results and insufficient identification of the hemostatic defect are obstacles for conventional laboratory coagulation tests. The evidence is growing that rotational thrombelastometry or modified thrombelastography are superior to routine laboratory tests in guiding intraoperative coagulation management. Specific platelet function tests may be of value in platelet-dependent bleeding associated e.g. with extracorporeal circulation, antiplatelet therapy, inherited or acquired platelet defects. Therapeutic approaches include the use of blood products (red cell concentrates, platelets, plasma), coagulation factor concentrates (fibrinogen, prothrombin complex, von Willebrand factor), pharmacological agents (antifibrinolytic drugs, desmopressin), and local factors (fibrin glue). The importance of normothermia, normovolemia, and homeostasis for hemostasis must not be overlooked. The present article reviews pathomechanisms of coagulopathy in massive bleeding, as well as routine laboratory tests and viscoelastic point-of-care hemostasis monitoring as the diagnostic basis for therapeutic interventions."

Effects of 2 years of frozen storage at -80 degrees C and transportation in dry ice.,"Platelet studies were done in healthy male volunteers and in thrombocytopenic patients. Some of the platelets used in the study were isolated by mechanical apheresis using either the Haemonetics blood processor 30, the IBM blood processor 2997 or the Fenwal CS-3000 blood processor before freezing. Other platelets were isolated from individual units of whole blood and pooled before freezing. The platelets were frozen with a 6% cryoprotectant (DMSO) in a polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastic bag or a polyolefin plastic bag at -80 degrees C in a mechanical freezer and stored for as long as 3 years. Some of the frozen platelets were transported in dry ice in polystyrene foam containers to determine whether they would be adversely affected by such treatment. Platelet recovery after freezing, thawing and washing was about 75%. In the healthy male volunteers, in vivo recovery of autologous platelets 1-2 h after transfusion was about 33%, and the life span was about 8 days. In the thrombocytopenic patients, in vivo recovery values were 50% of those from fresh platelets. The transfusion of previously frozen washed platelets reduced clinical bleeding in the thrombocytopenic patients with bleeding.

Little is known about physiological conditions influencing the efficacy of recombinant activated factor VII. We investigated the in-vitro effects of pH, temperature, and haemodilution on the activity of recombinant activated factor VII. Samples from eight healthy volunteers were spiked with recombinant activated factor VII (final concentration 1.7 microg/ml) and adjusted to pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, and 7.4 or analysed at 30, 33, 37, and 40 degrees C, or diluted 0, 10, 20, 40, and 60% with dextran before analysis. Samples were analysed as rotational thromboelastometry in whole blood (clotting time, clot formation time, and maximum clot firmness) with and without Innovin (tissue factor), and as factor VII coagulant activity in plasma. Significant effects of pH were observed for clotting time, clot formation time, maximum clot firmness, and factor VII coagulant activity in the direction of longer clot formation times and less firm clots with decreasing pH. Temperature had significant effects on clotting time, clot formation time, and factor VII coagulant activity, but no effects on maximum clot firmness indicating that lower temperatures increase clot formation times without affecting clot firmness. Haemodilution had significant effects on clot formation time, maximum clot firmness, and factor VII coagulant activity, but no effects on clotting time indicating that haemodilution does not affect clot formation, but the clot formed at high haemodilution may not be so firm. In conclusion, the activity of recombinant activated factor VII was affected in vitro by pH, temperature, and haemodilution. Additional studies are necessary to demonstrate that these conditions also affect the efficacy of recombinant activated factor VII therapy in vivo."

CD010438,0,1952169,0,Effects of epidural anesthesia and analgesia on coagulation and outcome after major vascular surgery.,"To examine the interaction of epidural anesthesia, coagulation status, and outcome after lower extremity revascularization, 80 patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease were prospectively randomized to receive general anesthesia combined with postoperative epidural analgesia (GEN-EPI) or general anesthesia with on-demand narcotic analgesia (GEN). Demographics did not differ between groups except that the GEN-EPI group had a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus and of previous myocardial infarction. Coagulation status was monitored using thromboelastography. An additional 40 randomly selected patients without atherosclerotic vascular disease undergoing noncardiovascular procedures served as controls for coagulation status. Vascular surgical patients were hypercoagulable compared with control patients before operation and on the first postoperative day. Postoperatively, this hypercoagulability was attenuated in the GEN-EPI group and was associated with a lower incidence of thrombotic events (peripheral arterial graft coronary artery or deep vein thromboses). The rates of cardiovascular, infectious, and overall postoperative complications, as well as duration of intensive care unit stay, were significantly reduced in the GEN-EPI group. Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that the only significant predictors of postoperative cardiovascular complications were preoperative congestive heart failure and general anesthesia without epidural analgesia. We conclude that in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease undergoing arterial reconstructive surgery (a) thromboelastographic evidence of increased platelet-fibrinogen interaction is associated with early postoperative thrombotic events, and (b) epidural anesthesia and analgesia is associated with beneficial effects on coagulation status and postoperative outcome compared with intermittent on-demand opioid analgesia."
CD010438,0,20641167,0,The induction of thrombus generation on nanostructured neutral polymer brush surfaces.,"Surface induced thrombus generation is a major clinical concern associated with vascular medical devices and implants. Here, we show that high graft density hydrophilic non-charged poly (N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) brushes prevent the initiation of blood coagulation on synthetic surfaces. Using a multi-faceted analysis approach, we have identified that PDMA brushes greater than 0.27 chains/nm2 graft density showed this highly desired property. Non-specific protein adsorption is greatly reduced on high density brushes compared to bare surface as evident from isothermal titration calorimetry, gel electrophoresis, and proteomic analyses. We have identified approximately 129 proteins of various types on bare and PDMA brush coated surfaces at a range of surface concentrations. Thromboelastography, platelet activation, and aggregation analyses show that only high graft density brushes are neutral to blood coagulation. Since the polymer brush synthesis can be adapted to most currently used biomedical materials, these results have significant impact in the design of highly hemocompatible surfaces."

The modification of liposomes with polyethyleneglycol (PEG) can often be useful in liposomal formation and pharmacokinetics. However, there is a dilemma concerning the use of PEG because of its poor intracellular trafficking properties. To overcome this problem, in the present study, we report on a strategy for improving the intracellular trafficking of PEG-modified lipid particles by incorporating a short PEG lipid. The findings presented here show that the incorporation of tetra(ethylene)glycol (TEG)-conjugated cholesterol into a liposome composition is useful in controlling the number of lipid envelopes, resulting in an improvement in particle uniformity with a reduced particle size. The TEG-modified lipid particles were found to enhance transfection activity by more than 100-fold. This increase is attributed to an enhancement of cellular uptake, and nuclear transcription by improving intracellular decoating. Moreover, the use of a various short PEG lipids in lipid particle formation showed a clear threshold polymerization degree (less or equal 25: PEG1100), for achieving stimulated transfection activity. Collectively, the use of short PEG lipid promises to be useful in developing an efficient non-viral gene vector."

One of these problems is the retransfusion of the citrate or heparin added for anticoagulation of blood. Heparin itself may be responsible for a disturbance of coagulation. The efficiency of eliminating heparin by washing it in the Haemonetics Cell Saver was tested by means of a high sensitive heparin test. Partly the samples were totally free of heparin, partly small remains of heparin could be found. Even the maximum value of 60 I.E. measured in one autologous red blood cell concentrate is of no importance for the daily clinical practice.

In order to extend the application of platelet-directed gene therapy, we examined whether ectopic expression of activated factor VII (FVIIa) in platelets would result in an efficient bypass therapy to induce sufficient thrombin generation on platelet surfaces in mice with hemophilia A. Transduction of bone marrow cells with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-based lentiviral vector harboring the platelet-specific GPIb alpha promoter resulted in efficient transgene expression in platelets. FVIIa antigen was expressed in platelets by this SIV system; FVII transgene products were found to localize in the cytoplasm and translocate toward the sub-membrane zone and cell surface after activation. Although FVII antigen levels in platelets did not reach the therapeutic levels seen with FVIIa infusion therapy, whole-blood coagulation, as assessed by thromboelastography, was significantly improved in mice with hemophilia A. Further, we observed correction of the bleeding phenotype in mice with hemophilia A after transplantation, even in the presence of FVIII-neutralizing antibodies. Our results demonstrate that FVIIa-expressing platelets can strengthen hemostatic function and may be useful in treating hemophilia and other inherited bleeding disorders. These findings are comparable to the proven therapeutic effects of FVIIa infusion."

The study aims to answer 3 donor-related questions: To what extent are the blood cells changed by the donation? How does the donor respond to the technical requirements of the donation, such as length of the procedure, blood volume processed, amount of concentrate removed during the donation? How often did side-effects or undesired reactions occur? We found that thrombocytapheresis led to a decrease in platelets in the peripheral blood of between 20% (CS3000) and 33.7% (IBM), and an increase in leukocytes of between 4.24% (IBM) and 17.8% (Model 30), whereas erythrocytes, hemoglobin and hematocrit showed a similar decrease within a range of between 1.1% and 2.67% in all systems. Following leukocytapheresis the leukocyte counts of the peripheral blood were decreased by up to 12%, erythrocyte counts by up to 5% and platelets between 15% (IBM) and 29% (Model 30). The list of irregularities included technical problems and donor reactions (e.g., citrate reactions, reactions of blood circulation, and blood flow in the donor). There were no serious side-effects. Early terminations of 42 (= 1.9%) donations were for prophylactic reasons exclusively. Few moderate undesired reactions occurred (4 = 0.2%), but none of the donors contributing to the more than 2,000 donations were ever hospitalized, demonstrating the safety of cytapheresis with all separators."

The overall rate of side-effects was 7.41% (absolute number 881). There was a significant difference between female and male donors concerning the frequency of hypotension episodes and citrate toxicity related reactions. There were also distinct differences between the single cell separator types concerning the frequency and type of side effects. Hypotension episodes and citrate-related reactions were observed most frequently during cytapheresis with the H-30 (7.65 and 2.96% respectively).

We report on our initial experience with sequentially analyzing platelet function in patients provided with the Incor left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and the Excor LVAD system. Thirteen patients 5 to 61 years old with acute or end-stage heart failure were included in a pilot study. Five of the 10 Incor patients underwent LVAD placement under emergency conditions, and 5 were electively scheduled for surgery. All 3 patients with an Excor device had been connected to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system prior to insertion of the device. An anticoagulation protocol including heparin, aspirin, and clopidogrel was employed, and the patients were closely monitored with a special platelet analyzing system that allows dose optimization for antiplatelet drugs. Initial platelet function was normal in only 2 patients (15%). During a follow-up period of 1770 days (cumulative >4.8 years), no early (<30 days) bleeding complications related to device implantation occurred. Late cerebral thromboembolic events were noted in 3 patients. One patient experienced severe stroke mandating neurosurgery during mechanical assist, and 1 patient experienced systemic embolism.

However, the short in-vivo half-life of approximately 2.5 hours makes multiple injections necessary, which is inconvenient for both physicians and patients. Here we describe the generation of a recombinant FVIIa molecule with an extended half-life based on genetic fusion to human albumin. The recombinant FVII albumin fusion protein (rVII-FP) was expressed in mammalian cells and upon activation displayed a FVII activity close to that of wild type FVIIa. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats demonstrated that the half-life of the activated recombinant FVII albumin fusion protein (rVIIa-FP) was extended six- to seven-fold compared with wild type rFVIIa. The in-vitro and in-vivo efficacy was evaluated and was found to be comparable to a commercially available rFVIIa (NovoSeven((R))). The results of this study demonstrate that it is feasible to develop a half-life extended FVIIa molecule with haemostatic properties very similar to the wild-type factor."

In the Dextran group the patients were infused first with dextran 7 ml/kg, then with Ringer's acetate. In the Ringer group, the patients received only Ringer's acetate. In the recovery room fluid therapy was continued with 5% dextrose in water until the first postoperative day. Blood loss and fluid replacement were comparable in the groups. Haematocrit (Hcr) decreased significantly in the Dextran group, and the platelet count decreased in both groups during surgery. The median baseline AT III values were similar in the study groups. In the recovery room, the median AT III value was lower in the Dextran than in the Ringer group, 78% and 92%, respectively (P < 0.05). By the following day, the AT III values had returned near the initial level. After surgery, the maximal amplitude of thromboelastogram was 48 mm in the Dextran group, and 58 mm in the Ringer group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, fluid replacement with dextran resulted in modest and short-lived alterations in blood coagulation."

Conventional TEG during CPB is not possible due to the sensitivity of the TEG to even small amounts of heparin, which produces a nondiagnostic tracing. The purpose of this study was to compare heparin neutralization using heparinase or protamine in TEG blood samples obtained during CPB. TEG testing was performed on 48 patients before, during and after CPB. Tissue plasminogen activator activity and antigen were measured on a subset of 32 patients. We found: 1) heparinase neutralized at least 10 IU/ml heparin while 1.6 ug/ml protamine neutralized up to 7 IU/ml heparin, 2) in samples with complete heparin neutralization by both methods, there was no significant difference in the R values, 3) while there was good correlation for other TEG parameters between heparinase and protamine treated samples, heparinase treatment produced shorter K values and higher angle, MA and A60, 4) while fibrinolysis was detected using both methods, heparinase treatment suppressed fibrinolysis in the TEG in both samples from patients and after in vitro addition of tissue plasminogen activator, 5) TEG was not a sensitive indicator of t-PA activity, detecting only 21% of samples with increased t-PA activity during bypass, and 5) heparinase was at least 100 times more expensive than protamine. We conclude that while both heparinase and protamine can be used to neutralize heparin in TEG samples obtained during CPB, protamine neutralization is more sensitive to fibrinolysis and less expensive, but the protamine dose must be carefully selected to match the heparin level used at individual institutions."

Thromboelastography can be performed with a variety of activator and inhibitors at different concentrations representing the most important factors for different intervals and clot formation variables reported in multiple studies and algorithms. Furthermore, fibrinogen levels and platelet counts have a major influence on thromboelastographic variables.

CD010438,0,6506834,0,[Relation between procoagulant activity and fetal lung maturity in amniotic fluid].,"A total of 146 samples of amniotic fluid from the 15th to 43rd weeks of pregnancy were taken by either transabdominal amniocentesis or amniotomy during birth. In addition to the palmitic/stearic ratio (P/S) the following coagulation tests were determined: clotting time, modified prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), recalcification time and, in selected samples, thrombelastograms. In the course of pregnancy there is a significant shortening of all coagulation tests measured in amniotic fluid. Comparing the values obtained in the 15th to 18th and the 37th to 43rd weeks of gestation and literature results the following values may indicate fetal maturity: clotting time less than 100 sec., modified prothrombin time less than 80 sec., PTT less than 30 sec. and recalcification time less than 80 sec. The lower limit for P/S ratio in normal pregnancy is 5,0. In 58 cases, amniotic fluid was obtained in the 37th to 43rd week at most 24 hours before delivery; there was no case of RDS in this group. Eliminating intermediate P/S values of 4,5 to 5,0 a false negative rate of 1,7% for the prediction of fetal lung maturity was seen. The corresponding rate for the modified prothrombin time was 3,4% and for the clotting time 6,4%. In 7 RDS cases all cases could be properly predicted from the recalcification time and the PTT. The fetal lung maturity may be estimated by means of simple and rapid coagulation tests and this may facilitate the indication for RDS-prophylaxis. The determination of the L/S or P/S ratios, however, cannot yet be dispensed with."

In order to realize this goal, plasma collections from volunteer donors must increase to about 1.5 million litres of plasma per year (1) or about 50% more than what the Japan Red Cross currently collects. A mobile device, such as the Superlite system, will make it easier and more efficient for Japan's sole blood collection agency, the Japan Red Cross, to add plasma collection to mobile blood drives. Haemonetics Corporation (Braintree, MA, USA) has combined many years of apheresis experience with up-to-date technology to create the Superlite Plasma Collection System (PCS) for the Japan Red Cross. This new device, which is expected to greatly contribute to the Red Cross's national source plasma collection program, is even smaller than the Ultralite PCS and offers several advanced features and benefits. Light, compact, and very portable, the Superlite has a Japanese language friendly user interface that continually displays collection status, including time remaining in the collection procedure. The device features a protocol that limits extra-corporeal blood volume for low-weight donors; a program used in conjunction with a reduced volume disposable bowl. Superlite, designed for use in both fixed-site and mobile applications, combines the portable ease-of-use of the Ultralite with the collection process calculation abilities of the CCS to provide a state-of-the-art collection device that will help define the future of Japan plasma collection."

We report herein on the isolation and purification of a new type of anticoagulant protein, PP27, from human placenta. PP27 ran as a single band on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass (Mr) of 27 kDa under denaturing conditions and chromatography on a calibrated Sepharose 4B column indicated a molecular mass of 23 kDa, a value that is similar to those of other PP4 enzymes reported to date. The isoelectric point of PP27 was pI 5.2. PP27, at doses higher than 10 microg/ml, inhibited platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced platelet activation in a dose-dependent manner. The protein was found to inhibit the coagulation time in a concentration-dependent manner. PP27, which acts as a vascular anticoagulant of annexin type, inhibits the blood clotting process by virtue of its binding of essential lipids, which is dependent on the presence of Ca2+ ions. In the presence of Ca2+ ions, PP27 combines with platelet membranes and neutralizes their procoagulant effect. Coagulation, triggered by the addition of thromboplastin/lipid mixtures, is extinguished by PP27."

CD010438,0,20230412,0,Monitoring heparin anticoagulation in the acute phase response.,"The anticoagulant effect of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is monitored using the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). An APTT of 1.5-2.5 times the control is usually taken as the therapeutic range and assumed to reflect an anti-activated factor X (anti-Xa) level of 0.35-0.7 u/ml. However, in some cases, despite administration of sufficient heparin to achieve a therapeutic anti-Xa assay level, the APTT remains sub-therapeutic. This 'apparent heparin resistance' is commonly due to high levels of factor VIII (FVIII). In these situations, the anti-Xa is usually preferred for monitoring in order to avoid, what might be, dangerously high levels of heparin. We hypothesized that at high FVIII levels, the heparin resistance encountered may be genuine rather than apparent and that higher doses of heparin may indeed be needed for an equivalent anticoagulant effect. The relationship between heparin level, APTT and anticoagulant effect at different FVIII concentrations was determined using thrombelastography and the thrombin generation assay. Thromboelastographic and thrombin generation parameters concurred with APTT, demonstrating a genuine heparin resistance in the presence of high FVIII levels. This suggests that APTT may be a more accurate measure of anticoagulant effect in vivo than anti-Xa."

This was a prospective, observational study of patients admitted to a general ICU at a tertiary care university hospital with an expected stay of more than 24 h. Blood samples for TEG and standard coagulation analysis were obtained at admission. The APACHE II and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores and 30-day mortality were recorded. At ICU admission, 106 patients (42%) showed hypocoagulability as evaluated by TEG and these patients had higher first day SOFA score (P < 0.0001) and higher 30-days (42 vs. 13%, P < 0.0001) mortality than patients presenting with a normal TEG. In 30-day survivors, admission platelet count (P = 0.05), angle (P < 0.001) and maximal amplitude (P = 0.001) were higher and R decreased (P = 0.0013) compared with nonsurvivors. Hypocoagulability at admission as evaluated by TEG was an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-7.1]. Hypocoagulability as evaluated by TEG was frequent at admission in general ICU patients and associated with a higher rate of ventilator treatment, higher rate of renal replacement therapy and a higher use of blood products. Hypocoagulability is an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality."

However, published evidence does not support this approach as the tests are not fit for purpose, and their sensitivity and specificity are low. Some more global assays may have use in the diagnostic workup in subjects with hemorrhage, but none has been established to date as an efficient method for prediction of bleeding in unselected populations.

Accordingly, we examined the efficacy of a variety of coagulation tests to predict intraoperative blood loss in 60 patients presenting for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). A complete coagulation screen, activated clotting time (ACT), and thromboelastograph (TEG) were performed before surgery. Intraoperative blood loss was determined by weighing sponges and measuring the quantity of blood in suction canisters. The duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was 100 +/- 4 min, and total surgery time was 5.0 +/- 0.1 h. Total crystalloid and colloid requirements were 5.5 +/- 0.2 and 1.4 +/- 0.1 L. Forty-eight percent of the patients required blood with an average requirement of 2.5 +/- 0.5 units. Total intraoperative blood loss averaged 1590 +/- 95 mL with a range from 640 to 3928 mL. Using multiple linear regression, all coagulation and TEG variables were used to model perioperative blood loss. Results showed that all components of the TEG failed to predict blood loss (r < 0.25, P > 0.78). However, three components of the routine coagulation assay, including bleeding time, prothrombin time, and platelet count could be modeled to predict perioperative blood loss (r = 0.75, P < 0.05). Although TEG has been shown to have potential in identifying postcardiopulmonary bypass coagulopathies, these results suggest that it does not appear to be useful in determining the coagulation status of CABG patients preoperatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

To investigate the basis for the use of drug therapy in gastric bleeding, this study used thrombelastography to determine the effects of pharmacological manipulation of gastric juice on coagulation and fibrinolysis. The thrombelastograph is a mechanical device that provides a visual assessment of all stages of coagulation and fibrinolysis. The effects of fresh and pharmacologically changed gastric juice was assessed after its addition to fresh whole blood in the thrombelastograph cuvette. Pharmacological manipulation was achieved through alkalisation or through addition of tranexamic acid, aprotinin, or sucralfate. Fresh gastric juice delayed clot formation, decreased maximum clot amplitude, and stimulated clot lysis. Alkalisation inhibited the lytic effects of fresh gastric juice and improved the induced abnormalities in coagulation. Tranexamic acid partially inhibited gastric juice induced clot lysis but did not exhibit a beneficial effect on coagulation. Sucralfate, and to a lesser extent aprotinin significantly inhibited fibrinolysis but exacerbated the detrimental effect of gastric juice on the parameters of coagulation. Alkalisation of gastric juice reduces the adverse effect on coagulation and fibrinolysis. Tranexamic acid, aprotinin, and sucralfate can all reduce or inhibit clot lysis, but the adverse effects on clot formation may outweigh any potential benefit in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding."

Advantages over traditional coagulation tests relate to the rapid feedback of results and the ability to visualise hyperfibrinolysis. We present a case of suspected amniotic fluid embolism that presented with sudden respiratory arrest associated with haemodynamic compromise during a non-elective caesarean delivery. Soon after the collapse, coagulopathy developed. Rotational thromboelastometry showed hyperfibrinolysis and hypofibrinogenaemia, which allowed targeted coagulation factor replacement therapy and the use of tranexamic acid. Hyperfibrinolysis may be a contributor to the coagulopathy associated with amniotic fluid embolism but has been infrequently reported, perhaps due to limited diagnosis with traditional coagulation tests.

CD010438,0,19905844,0,Massive GI bleeding due to accidental ASA inhalation.,"This report describes a 38-year-old man admitted to hospital for a massive rectal bleeding and syncope. He was known to have idiopathic thrombocytopenia but he had never complained of bleeding until he was admitted to hospital with uncontrolled hemorrhage. Upper and lower endoscopic examination, performed 6 hours after occurrence of bleeding, were negative for ulcers or other bleeding lesions. However, capsule endoscopy did detect diffuse areas of petechial hemorrhage and erosions in the small bowel. Thromboelastography performed on the day of admission showed a marked decrease in platelet aggregation rate, that normalized two days after. The patient recovered with conservative treatment only. Thorough questioning did not evidence relevant events apart from inhalation of a massive quantity of acetylsalicylic acid: the patient, working as a farmer, had prepared, without protection, fodder for the animals containing a great amount of acetylsalicylic acid. Bleeding had started few hours thereafter. After recovery, bleeding did not recur despite persistent thrombocytopenia."

During the period from June until September 2005, 40 patients undergoing reoperation for coronary artery bypass grafting were allocated into two equal groups (n = 20): Group 1 was treated with hyaluronan-based heparin-bonded circuits and group 2 was treated with uncoated control circuits. Complete blood count, fibrinogen, albumin, C3a, interleukin-2 levels, and thromboelastographic data were documented after induction of anesthesia (T1) and heparin administration before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (T2), 15 minutes after initiation of CPB (T3), before cessation of CPB (T4), 15 minutes after reversal with protamine (T5), and the first postoperative day at 8:00 a.m. (T6). Hollow fibers were collected for consecutive biomaterial analysis by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Desorbed protein deposition on fibers was compared by spectrophotometry. Leukocyte counts were lower in T4-T6 in group 1 (p < .05). Platelet counts demonstrated significant differences at T4 and T5 in coated group (p < .05). Albumin and fibrinogen levels were better preserved in Group 1 at T4, T5 and T4, T6, consecutively (p < .05). C3a and IL-2 levels were lower at T3-T5 and T4-T5 in intervention group (p < .05). Postoperative hemorrhage was 412 +/- 50 mL in group 1 and 684 +/- 50 ml in group 2 (p < .05). Respiratory support time was shorter in group 1 versus control (p < .05). Platelet adhesion was significantly lower in intervention group. Amount of desorbed protein was 1.44 +/- 0.01 mg/dL in group 1 and 1.94 +/- 0.01 mg/dL in control (p < .05). SEM and spectrophotometry demonstrated better surface preservation in the hyaluronan coated group. Novel hyaluronan-based heparin-bonded circuits reduce platelet adhesion-aggregation and protein adsorption and provide better perioperative clinical parameters through platelet, albumin, and fibrinogen-sparing effects."

CD010438,0,138961,0,On the reliability of plasminogen measurement employing the proactivator-activator converting method.,"A simple plasminogen determination method is presented. It is based upon the conversion of plasminogen into activator by large and constant amounts of streptokinase. The activator contained in a standard coagulum consisting of bovine fibrin, streptokinase, and a 1:40 dilution of human plasma converts the plasminogen adsorbed on bovine fibrin into plasmin. Lysis of the test coagulum is hereby induced. The speed of such lysis is limited by the concentration of the activator incorporated in the test coagulum. The variable component of the activator being human plasminogen, the speed of lysis is directly dependent upon the concentration of human plasminogen in the standard coagulum. Using the thromboelastograph according to Hartert in recording the test clot lysis times, this method of plasminogen determination was shown to be a simple and quick procedure. The standard deviation ranged from +/- 13,2 tp 68%, depending upon the plasminogen value to be measured (lower rates of error were attached to high, and higher rates of error to low, plasminogen concentrations). The biological variation of plasminogen values in a group of 26 men aged from 40 to 65 years was calculated to be +/- 21%. Both plasminogen and plasmin, its activated form, were exchangeable in the test, i.e. plasminogen determinations performed by activator assay did not differentiate between plasminogen and plasmin. There was no influence by varying anti-SK titers in the plasma up to a circulating antibody content of 2 million. Furthermore, plasma antiplasmins did not affect the plasminogen measuring system. Plasminogen tested by activator assay displayed values closely related to those achieved by immunochemical methods. Plasminogen measurements were performed in patients undergoing streptokinase and urokinase infusion treatment. 5,000 u streptokinase per hour, as well as 270,000 CTA-u urokinase per hour, infused over a period of 2 days produced a fall in plasminogen down to 30-60% of normal. In contrast, 100,000 u streptokinase per hour lowered the plasminogen concentration down to values of below 1%. The foregoing data indicate that plasminogen measurement, according to the principles outlined here (activator assay), may be regarded as a valuable and reliable method for the routine control of streptokinase and urokinase therapy."

CD010438,0,519354,0,Haemorrheological response to plasma exchange in Raynaud's syndrome.,"Eight patients with Raynaud's syndrome were treated by weekly plasma exchange for four weeks using a Haemonetics Model 30 Blood Processor. The mean whole-blood viscosity at a shear rate of 0.77/s was significantly lower after treatment, and the mean index of red-cell deformability was significantly improved. In four patients studied serially the mean percentage fall in whole-blood viscosity after a single plasma exchange was 49% at 0.77/s but only 14% at 91/s. All patients noticed symptomatic improvement including healing of ischaemic digital ulcers. In six patients the number of digital arterial segments containing detectable blood flow was measured by directional Doppler; in all six the number increased. It is concluded that plasma exchange is an effective means of haemorrheological treatment and may be beneficial in patients with digital ischaemia."

CD010438,0,18508379,0,The prevalence of a heparin-like effect shown on the thromboelastograph in patients undergoing liver transplantation.,"It has been known for several decades that thromboelastographic analysis of the blood of patients undergoing liver transplantation may show a heparin-like effect (HLE) at the time of reperfusion. However, the prevalence of HLE and the origin of these heparin-like substances remain largely unstudied. The primary aim of this retrospective observational analysis was to determine the prevalence of the HLE in 211 consecutive patients having liver transplantation in our institution at various stages throughout the transplant. One of the secondary aims was to analyze the prevalence of HLE with respect to the various etiologies of liver disease. Paired Thromboelastograph traces (native and heparinase) were examined at 5 stages of the transplant: the baseline stage, dissection stage, anhepatic stage, reperfusion stage, and end of the case. HLE was defined as a reduction in the reaction and coagulation times of greater than 50% by the addition of heparinase to the sample. Thirty-one percent of patients had evidence of an HLE at baseline, and this increased to 75% after reperfusion of the donor graft. This HLE resolved spontaneously in 47% by the end of the case. Patients with fulminant liver failure were more likely to demonstrate HLE at baseline than those with chronic liver disease (45.8% compared to 29%). There was no difference in the prevalence of HLE after reperfusion. In conclusion, prior to transplantation, there is a significant difference in the prevalence of HLE with respect to etiology. However, this difference disappears after reperfusion as the majority of patients then develop HLE. Although it is clear that there are both endogenous and exogenous sources of heparin contributing to the HLE, the clinical significance of these findings remains unclear."

Owing to its multimeric structure and sensitivity to proteolysis, VWF can be used as a marker of the impact of collection procedures on the characteristics of plasma for transfusion and for fractionation. We studied VWF content, functional activity and HMW multimers in plasmas collected by five different automated apheresis collection procedures."
CD010438,0,138962,0,Studies on activator formation in human plasma with streptokinase. III. Investigation of activator kinetics in undiluted plasma in terms of urokinase equivalents.,"A new method is presented for estimating the activator (plasminogen-streptokinase complex) concentration in native plasma of patients undergoing streptokinase infusion. The principle of the method is based on clot lysis time as recorded by the thromboelastograph. The test clot constituents were bovine fibrinogen, bovine plasminogen, EDTA, human plasma (with unknown activator concentrations), and thrombin. In order to obtain a standardization line, urokinase dissolved in NaCl solution was substituted for patients' plasma. Thus, each lysis time could easily be converted into urokinase equivalent (CTA-u/ml). Streptokinase and plasminogen molecules in undiluted patients' plasma were found to exist both in an activator-bound (equimolar plasminogen-streptokinase complex) and in a freely circulating form. This result is in agreement with earlier findings where the activator complex was demonstrated to be a widely dissociated complex in highly diluted plasma of patients, thus displaying an ample proportion of free streptokinase and plasminogen and molecules. Streptokinase treatment using dosage schemes of 100,000 u SK/h, and 200,000 u/h were monitored by quantitative activator, streptokinase, and plasminogen measurements. An average activator concentration of 50-100 CTA-u/ml and a SK-concentration of 7-16 u/ml were recorded during streptokinase infusion. Plasminogen values averaged 0.25%, independent of the amount of streptokinase infused. Each drop in streptokinase was accompanied by a drop in activator during the infusion, and each rise in streptokinase by a rise in activator. There was a strong correlation between streptokinase and activator concentrations in that, on the average, 1 u streptokinase equalled 8.4 CTA-u/ml activator (correlation coefficient r = 0.9) It is concluded that the activator concentration in the plasma of patients undergoing fibrinolytic treatment can easily be adjusted by regulating the hourly streptokinase influx."

CD010438,0,9527279,0,Plasmapheresis in the treatment of posttransplant cardiomyopathy.,"After heart transplantation a number of factors such as pre- and postoperative hypoxia of the myocardium, myocardial failure of the early postoperative period, acute rejection episodes, cytomegalovirus infection, and finally the progressive atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries lead to the development of transplanted heart failure. Severe alterations of the myocardial function at this end stage of the process correspond to incurable cardiomyopathy. The target of plasmapheresis in this case is to decrease the extent of the disturbances in the lipoprotein contents and blood rheology for the improvement of the coronary perfusion of the transplanted heart. Nine patients with 3-7 year survival periods after heart transplantations underwent plasmapheresis twice a year using the Haemonetics PCS-plus machine. 2,100-2,700 ml of plasma was removed. Biochemical data, rheology and coagulation, and the concentration of Sandimmune (Sandoz Pharma Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) were controlled, and radionuclide scintigraphy of the myocardium, coronarographia, and transesophageal ultrasound investigations were completed for these patients. The result was the significant improvement of the coronary perfusion of the myocardium. The level of immunosuppression after the plasmapheresis procedures did not change and therefore did not demand any correction. Thus, we think that plasmapheresis can be an effective method of treatment of posttransplantation cardiomyopathy; the improvement of coronary perfusion decreases the extent of chronic ischemia. Further studies are necessary to answer the question as to whether it is possible to prolong the time before retransplantation with the help of plasmapheresis."

Experience in 725 consecutive cases.,"Autologous intraoperative transfusion employing the Haemonetics Cell Saver is reported in 725 patients from a general hospital population, of which 75% were cardiovascular patients. The remaining cases included various orthopedic procedures, splenectomy, craniotomy, ectopic pregnancies, Caesarian sections, and exploratory laparotomy. On occasion, this method was utilized in trauma and in pediatric surgery. The product of washed red blood cells gave an average yield of 573 cc per case with an average hematocrit of 55 cc/dl available for autologous infusion. In 100 consecutive open heart procedures operated prior to the Cell Saver period, an average of 1.97 units of bank blood was utilized during operation, as compared with 0.75 units in 100 consecutive cases studied employing the Cell Saver (p less than 0.0001). Homologous blood utilization during cardiac surgery declined more than 50% with the use of the Cell Saver. Quality control was monitored scrupulously and included special precautions against air embolism, abnormal coagulation, and sepsis. The overall mortality rate was 2.8%, and in no instance was mortality or morbidity ascribable to the autologous transfusion. Numerous advantages offered by autotransfusion include prevention of sensitization of the recipient to various antigens in donor erythrocytes, leucocytes, platelets, and plasma, and avoidance of transfusion-transmitted diseases, especially viral hepatitis. Additionally, autologous blood, the only perfectly compatible product, provided immediate availability while conserving blood bank resources. In circumstances in which the intraoperative blood loss exceeded 1000 cc in the adult, its use was observed to be cost-effective. In the present study, autotransfusion proved safe, efficient, and in some instances life saving."
CD010438,0,17430464,0,"Processing of stored packed red blood cells using autotransfusion devices decreases potassium and microaggregates: a prospective, randomized, single-blinded in vitro study.","The aim of the study was to compare the potential of autotransfusion devices to reduce non-infectious complications related to transfusion of long-stored packed red blood cells (PRBC; n= 57), such as changes in electrolytes, blood cells and the load of free microaggregates. Following a baseline measurement, a blood pool of three PRBC was divided into three equal volumes and washed with either the Haemonetics Cell Saver (HCS) or the continuous autotransfusion system (C.A.T.S), using the quality (CATS(quality)) and emergency (CATS(emergency)) mode. After the washing procedure, measurements for electrolytes, blood cells and free microaggregates were repeated (n= 19 each). Compared with baseline, the investigated autotransfusion devices reduced the median load of potassium (baseline: 52 mEq L(-1); HCS: 4 mEq L(-1); CATS(quality): 4 mEq L(-1); CATS(emergency): 17 mEq L(-1); each P < 0.001), restored a physiologic electrolyte balance and significantly decreased the load of leucocytes, glucose and protein. Whereas the quantity of microaggregates was not reduced by HCS, CATS(emergency) decreased the load of cell fragments below 7.8 microm (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). Using CATS(quality) decreased the load of cell fragments not only to a diameter below 7.8 microm (P < 0.001 vs. baseline) but also of microaggregates between 7.8 and 17.6 microm (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). In situations where long-stored PRBC have to be transfused, the procedure described here may be feasible to reduce clinically relevant side effects, i.e. hyperkalaemia and microvascular obstruction secondary to free cell fragments. This approach could be especially useful in patients undergoing massive transfusion and/or suffering from renal failure."

CD010438,0,17287627,0,A functional clotting assay to monitor the hirudin dosage.,"Hirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has potential advantages over indirect thrombin inhibitors and is increasingly used in clinical settings. There are, however, large variations in individual responses to this drug and no recognized clinical laboratory tests used to monitor its anticoagulant effects. We evaluated the use of the thromboelastograph, a common clinical coagulation instrument, to monitor the effects of hirudin in vitro. We developed a novel, whole blood clotting assay that utilizes the tissue factor stimulating properties of mercuric ion to measure the anticoagulant potential of therapeutic doses of hirudin. At doses equivalent to those found in the therapeutic range, the thromboelastograph was capable of showing significant changes when compared with control and different concentrations of hirudin (P < 0.05). A linear relationship was observed between increasing concentrations of recombinant hirudin and clotting times. In conclusion, the use of this test system warrants further investigation for monitoring hirudin."
CD010438,0,17287624,0,Differential effects of direct thrombin inhibitors and antithrombin-dependent anticoagulants on the dynamics of clot formation.,"New anticoagulants, including the direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) and fondaparinux, are increasingly replacing unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin. We examined the effects of argatroban (n = 60), bivalirudin (n = 44), heparin (n = 14), enoxaparin (n = 22), and fondaparinux (n = 24) on clot formation utilizing thromboelastography. Blood samples containing anticoagulants at clinically relevant concentrations were prepared ex vivo and analyzed using kaolin or tissue factor activation. Thromboelastography parameters of clot initiation (R), clot propagation (K and angle), clot rigidity (maximum amplitude) and clot elasticity (G) were compared between anticoagulants. Thromboelastography was also performed on blood from eight patients receiving anticoagulants. Each anticoagulant exerted significant concentration-dependent effects on R, K and angle. Only heparin, enoxaparin, and fondaparinux significantly affected maximum amplitude and G. Significant differences existed for all parameters between heparin and each anticoagulant and between fondaparinux and each DTI (P < 0.001), and for angle, maximum amplitude, and G between enoxaparin and each DTI (P < 0.008). Thromboelastography responses in ex-vivo samples and patient samples were comparable. In conclusion, whereas argatroban, bivalirudin, heparin, enoxaparin and fondaparinux each delay clot formation, the DTIs do not alter clot rigidity or elasticity. The reduced bleeding reported with DTIs versus heparin may relate to the fact that clots form with normal rigidity and elasticity."

Using fluorescently labeled G1(Gu(+))(9)R with pyrenyl and rhodamine focal cores, the adhesion process can be visualized by FRET or confocal laser scanning microscopy. The adhesion to microtubules leads to their stabilization against depolymerization into alpha/beta-tubulin heterodimer components, where the effects of G1(Gu(+))(9)R and Asn(TEG-Gu(+))(9) are comparable to that of paclitaxel, known as an anticancer drug. Since G1(Gu(+))(9)R and Asn(TEG-Gu(+))(9) are superior to lower-generation G0(Gu(+))(3)OMe and arginine nonamer, respectively, the multivalency of the interaction and a conformational flexibility of the oligoether spacers play a crucial role in the efficient adhesion to proteins."

This phenomenon can be used to show chloroquine binding to polyanions. It is shown spectrophotometrically that glycosaminoglycans form complexes with chloroquine more readily than with pseudoisocyanine. Moreover chloroquine abolishes fluorescence of glycosaminoglycan inclusion bodies in leucocytes of mucopolysaccharidosis patients. A woman of 34 suffering from mucopolysaccharidosis type I-S had such inclusion bodies in 19 out of 200 leucocytes examined before and in only two after a month of chloroquine treatment. In heparinized blood chloroquine induces clotting faster than does saline in control samples. This finding suggests inactivation of polyanions by chloroquine binding.

The impact of hepatic resection on coagulation and fibrinolysis was studied with thromboelastography. Preoperatively, routine laboratory coagulation and liver function tests were normal in all patients. On the first postoperative day, prothrombin time was prolonged (range 16 to 22 seconds) in eight patients (38%). For these patients, thromboelastography was normal in six (75%), PF1 + 2 was elevated in four (50%), and thrombin-antithrombin complexes and von Willebrand Factor antigen were elevated in all, which was evidence of acute phase reaction, sustained coagulation factor turnover and activation. By the fifth postoperative day, despite normalisation of prothrombin time, markers of increased coagulation activity remained greater than 85% of baseline values. The findings indicate that in patients undergoing liver resection for cancer, there is significant and prolonged postoperative activation of the haemostatic system despite routine coagulation tests being normal or even prolonged. Before considering therapeutic interventions an integrated approach to interpreting haematological data with clinical correlation is essential."

Treatments were performed with apheresis machines, models Haemonetics 30-S and Baxter CS3000, using the standard program. This procedure was done because AA in many cases appears as a result of the action of a T cell population that inhibits hematopoiesis. Theoretically, removal of this clonal population would produce hematopoietic recovery. Of the total of 23 patients, 9 were excluded for final evaluation of treatment results because 7 died during or shortly after treatment (0.7-3 months); one patient abandoned treatment after three LC and another died 7 months later because of transformation to acute leukemia. The remaining 14 patients were included in the final evaluation of treatment; seven females and seven males, average age 46.1 years (range 22-69); 13 with severe, and one with moderate AA; 11 with recently diagnosed, and 3 with chronic AA; 12 without previous treatment and two treated before with antilymphocyte globulin + oxymetholone (OXM) + cyclosporine A (CsA) with transient partial remission (PR). Besides lymphocytapheresis, 13 patients received OXM; 4 of them GM-CSF and one low dose CsA. Four patients had complete remission lasting > 59.5 months (range 42-78); eight PR (average duration of > 38.6 months), and two minimal remission (> 37 and 29 months). Platelet, reticulocyte and granulocyte counts increased on average at 48.7, 73.3 and 91.4 days, respectively. In conclusion, 14 (60.8%) of 23 patients with AA showed an improvement related to LC treatment, with a survival probability of 63% from the fourth month, the latter with an added beneficial effect of the other therapies used.

CD010438,0,20224372,0,Postinjury coagulopathy management: goal directed resuscitation via POC thrombelastography.,"Progressive postinjury coagulopathy remains the fundamental rationale for damage control surgery, but the decision to abort operative intervention must occur before laboratory confirmation of coagulopathy. Current massive transfusion protocols have embraced pre-emptive resuscitation strategies emphasizing administration of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets in ratios approximating 1:1:1 during the first 24 hours postinjury, based on US military retrospective experience and recent noncontrolled civilian data. This policy, termed ""damage control resuscitation"" assumes that patients presenting with life threatening hemorrhage at risk for postinjury coagulopathy should receive component therapy in rations approximating those found in whole blood during the first 24 hours. While we concur with the concept of pre-emptive coagulation factor replacement, and initially suggested this in 1982, we remain concerned for the continued unbridled administration of fresh frozen plasma and platelets without objective evidence of their specific requirement. A major limitation of current massive transfusion protocols is the lack of real time assessment of coagulation function to guide evolving blood component requirements. Existing laboratory coagulation testing was originally designed for evaluation of hemophilia and subsequently used for monitoring anticoagulation therapy. Consequently, the applicability of these tests in the trauma setting has never been proven and the time required to conduct these assays is incompatible with prompt correction of the coagulopathy in the trauma setting. This review examines the current approach to postinjury coagulopathy, including identification of patients at risk, resuscitation strategies, design and implementation of institutional massive transfusion protocols, and the potential benefits of goal-directed therapy by real time assessment of coagulation function via point of care rapid thromboelastography."
CD010438,0,8204806,0,Evaluation of coagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass with a heparinase-modified thromboelastographic assay.,"Thromboelastography (TEG) is a useful method of assessing perioperative coagulation function in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The presence of significant amounts of heparin in blood samples, however, prevents determination of changes in coagulation function by TEG or introduces artifactual error if samples contain heparin that is not present in vivo. For these reasons, whole blood coagulation function monitoring with TEG has not been feasible during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with heparin anticoagulation. In this study, data obtained from 42 volunteers are presented to describe the effects of heparinase on TEG variables in the presence and absence of heparin. These data indicate that heparinase does not affect TEG parameters of whole blood not containing heparin and reverses the TEG effects of low levels of heparin contamination. Subsequently, 51 patients undergoing coronary artery surgery were studied using a modified TEG assay that incorporates in vitro application of heparinase to allow measurement of TEG parameters before, during, and after CPB. Heparinase-modified TEG assays facilitated diagnosis of heparin contamination in preoperative blood samples and permitted baseline TEG evaluation in patients receiving preoperative heparin infusions. Heparinase-modified TEG assays revealed declines in alpha and MA values during CPB, which persisted and significantly correlated with values after protamine infusion (alpha: r = 0.77, P = 0.001; MA: r = 0.78, P = 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Platelet rich plasma (PRP) was prepared from citrated blood samples of 5 normal volunteers diluted 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 volume ratio with human stroma-free hemoglobin solution (SFH) or human albumin (HSA). Coagulation kinetics and clot strength were assessed with a thrombelastograph (TEG). Extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation factors were assessed measuring prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) with an optical coagulation timer. Statistical significance was assessed using ANOVA and Neuman-Keuls tests at p < 0.05. At all dilutions, SFH diluted plasma showed significantly prolonged initial rate of clot formation compared to undiluted control or HSA (p < 0.05). However, there was no difference in formed clot strength between SFH and HSA. At high Hb concentrations Hb seems to interfere with the optical measurements of coagulation times (particularly aPTT). SFH appears to interfere with the initial phase coagulation mechanism in human plasma in-vitro; further study is needed to clarify the cause. In measuring coagulation times of plasma containing Hb a non-optical instrument should be considered."

Autologous blood was washed with 1000 ml of sterile normal saline at centrifuge speed of 5650 revolutions per minute (rpm) (group I) or 4350 rpm (group II) with different washing pump speeds--500, 800 and 1000 ml/min. Hemoglobin, free hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, and protein were measured before and after processing. The highest values of hemoglobin, hematocrit and erythrocytes were achieved using 800 and 1000 ml/min pump speeds in group I and 500 ml/min speed in group II. Red blood cells concentration was higher in group I. There were no significant changes of free hemoglobin removal within group I. In group II the lowest free hemoglobin was achieved when 1000 ml/min rate was used. Platelets and protein did not depend on wash pump speeds in both groups. Platelet recovery in group I was higher than in group II at all washing pump speeds. Leukocytes were not adequately removed at all pump speeds. The Cell Saver 5 produces optimum results when the high wash pump speeds (800 and 1000 ml/min) and standard centrifuge speed are used."
CD010438,0,15283824,0,The use of recalcified citrated whole blood -- a pragmatic approach for thromboelastography in children.,Thromboelastography (TEG) is an established way of monitoring the coagulation status of children and adults requiring blood products during surgery. Serial measurements are performed using a nearside machine and blood product prescription may be titrated against changes in TEG. There may also be useful applications when the patient is remote from the TEG machine but these are limited because TEG is usually performed on fresh native whole blood within 6 min of venepuncture. Citrated whole blood can be used for TEG if transport time is more than 6 min. We wished to establish whether TEG parameters for citrated whole blood were comparable with those of native whole blood in healthy children.

A 3.5-year-old boy had surgery for aortic stenosis and aortic arch repair and was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) after a prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPB); there was subsequent failure to wean from CPB because of right ventricular failure. Subsequently, a severe coagulopathy developed, and despite large volume transfusions with blood and blood products, this was unresolved. Thromboelastograph (TEG) measurements were obtained, and on the advice of the Hematology Department, Novo7 (recommended dose: 15-30 microg/kg) was administered at a dose of 200 microg/kg because of the severity of the bleeding. TEG was repeated, and a further dose of Novo7 was administered at 500 microg/kg; a further TEG after 15 minutes showed normalization, and the remaining bleeding was treated surgically. The patient was weaned from ECMO 48 hours later and was subsequently discharged home with no further problems. Novo7 in an ""overdose"" can apparently correct major coagulopathy even in patients on ECMO support with no dire effects on the ECMO circuit or the patient in a life-threatening scenario."
CD010438,0,873434,0,[Blood coagulation activity and fibrinolysis in umbilical vein blood of healthy and asphyxiated newborn infants].,In two groups of 35 healthy and 15 asphyctic newborns the factors of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis were determined and compared with the normal values of non-pregnant women. The study demonstrates an increased coagulability and increased fibrinolytic activity at decreased levels of most of the single factors in the umbilical vein blood of the newborn. There is a statistically significant decrease of the concentration of plasminogen and increase of the concentration of fibrin degradation products and fibrin monomers in the groups of asphyctic newborns as compared with healthy newborns. These results may be considered as factors in the etiology of the respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn resulting in the formation of hyaline membranes. An increased tendency to hemorrhages in asphyctic newborn due to a hypocoagulation of the umbilical vein blood cannot be suggested by these results. The study confirms and supplements previous research findings from our laboratory and from others reported in the literature.

The mean starting mononuclear cell (MNC) count was 1.22 x 10 8/kg recipient weight, and recovery was 92%. Clonogenic potential of the BC was assessed using CFU-GM assays and recovery was measured after cryopreservation or purging. On 4 occasions where major ABO incompatibility existed between donor and recipient, both BM and BC were consecutively diluted in compatible blood and processed twice. This achieved a calculated reduction in donor erythrocytes of 98%. The procedure was efficient and yielded a BC fraction suitable for cryopreservation and purging. Adequate stem-cells were retained as verified by CFU-GM assays and documentation of stable engraftment."

Plasma fibrinogen concentration (PFC), euglobulin lysis time (ELT) and relative plasma viscosity (RPV) and relative whole blood viscosity (RWBV) were estimated. The PFC, RPV, RWBV and ELT were significantly higher in new and old hypertensives (P < 0.005), respectively, compared with controls, while the RPV was significantly higher (P < 0.005) in new hypertensives than old hypertensives. The significantly higher PFC, RPV and ELT in new hypertensives correspond to higher BP in the new hypertensives than old hypertensives. There were consistence significance levels in PFC, RPV and ELT in both female hypertensives and controls (P < 0.005), respectively, with higher BP in male than female. Though there were no significant mean differences between the hypertensive patients in the first two years of the disease, there were cumulative consistent increase in fibrinogen levels and euglobulin lysis time from two years; while RPV shows inconsistence variation until the 5th year. We conclude that a defective rheology and fibrin-clearing mechanism may contribute to aetiology of vascular complications in hypertensive patients especially in the long term."
CD010438,0,10711770,0,The role of erythrocytapheresis in secondary erythrocytosis therapy.,"In chronic respiratory insufficiency secondary erythrocytosis (SPC), causing pulmonary hypertension and dx ventricular insufficiency, is often noticed. An alternative therapy to phlebotomy for SPC is isovolemic large volume erythrocytapheresis performed with cell separator (CSE) in order to quickly remove a large volume of red blood cells (RBC) while saving plasma proteins and clotting factors. In order to evaluate the efficiency and safety of CSE in SPC we reported a retrospective analysis of our experience with 61 SPC patients: from April 1996 to May 1998 we performed 208 CSE using Haemonetics MCS3P (TAE protocol). Before every apheresis procedure we verified Hb (in median 18.8 g/dl), Ht (in median 58.4%), viscometry, coagulation test, EGA, PFR and ECG. 11 patients were treated with 1 CSE, 12 with 3, 29 with 4 and 9 with 5. The mean volume of RBC removed was 576 ml (range 426-800); Hb post CSE averaged 14.4 g/dl and Ht post CSE averaged 42.7%; hematic viscosity post CSE was significantly reduced while tissue oxygen tension increased: the improvement of symptomatology and hematochemical parameters was maintained on the average for 6.5 months. All the procedures were well tolerated and light side effects (paresthesias citrate-depending in 27 apheresis) were easily controlled. CSE, compared to phlebotomy, has the advantage of selectively removing RBC without loss of clotting factors, platelets and plasma proteins. Although CSE has relatively high costs we noticed a decrease of hospital recurrence (about 50-65%) in SPC patients treated with apheresis."

The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the effects of fibrinogen, factor XIII and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) on clot formation and resistance to fibrinolysis in hemodilution conditions. Citrated whole blood from 36 healthy volunteers was diluted to 30 and 60% with lactated Ringer's solution. Blood samples were subsequently supplemented with fibrinogen, FXIII, TAFI or their combinations. Rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in whole blood and thrombin generation in plasma were performed in the presence of CaCl₂ and tissue factor/EXTEM reagent, and fibrinolysis was induced by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Hemodilution was expressed by decrease of peak height in thrombin generation and α-angle and maximum clot firmness (MCF) in ROTEM. Fibrinogen, FXIII or TAFI did not correct the decrease in thrombin generation peak height. In ROTEM, spiking of diluted blood with fibrinogen stimulated clot propagation. In tPA-treated blood fibrinogen, FXIII and TAFI increased clot firmness and inhibited fibrinolysis. Stronger protection against fibrinolysis was achieved combining FXIII with TAFI. Hemodilution was associated with inhibition of thrombin generation; however, this effect was not sensitive to blood spiking with fibrinogen, FXIII and TAFI. In ROTEM, these hemostasis agents improved clot strength and decreased clot susceptibility to tPA in nondiluted and to more extent in diluted blood. The maximal protection against fibrinolysis was caused by TAFI. Combining FXIII with TAFI exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on fibrinolysis."

To assess the complications of this procedure, we reviewed 75 consecutive PBSC transplant candidates requiring 554 leukapheresis on a Haemonetics V50 Plus apheresis system. CVC occlusion necessitating thrombolytic therapy or cancellation of the procedure was the most commonly observed complication, occurring among 37 patients on 86 occasions (15.9% of CVC-aided collections). Thrombolytic therapy was successful in 85%. Of the patients, 16% experienced an infectious complication during the PBSC harvesting; chemotherapy mobilization significantly increased this risk, whereas growth factor mobilization was protective (p < 0.02). Hematologic complications including anemia (median postapheresis nadir hemoglobin 8.8 g/dl) and transient thrombocytopenia (median postapheresis nadir 64,000/microliters) required transfusional support among 30.7% and 14.7% of patients, respectively. The use of chemotherapy mobilization was correlated with increased need for support of both red cells and platelets (p < 0.001). Additional complications included catheter placement problems, symptomatic citrate-related hypocalcemia, transient hypotension, and machine-related malfunctions. Although the complications of the PBSC harvests were manageable, given their frequency the decision to pursue this form of hematopoietic rescue in preference to traditional operative bone marrow harvesting must address these risks."

The corrolazine nanoparticles (MCz-NPs) were formed in H(2)O/THF (10:1) in the presence of a small amount of a polyethylene glycol derivative (TEG-ME) added as a stabilizer. This technique allows highly hydrophobic Czs to be ""dissolved"" in an aqueous environment as nanoparticles, which remain in solution for several months without visible precipitation. The MCz-NPs were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, and shown to be spherical particles from 100-600 nm in diameter with low polydispersity indices (PDI = 0.003-0.261). Particle size is strongly dependent on Cz concentration. The H(3)Cz-NPs were adsorbed on to a modified self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surface and imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Adsorption resulted in disassembly of the larger H(3)Cz-NPs to smaller H(3)Cz-NPs, whereby the resulting particle size can be controlled by the surface energy of the monolayer. The Fe(III)Cz-NPs were shown to be competent catalysts for the oxidation of cyclohexene with either PFIB or H(2)O(2) as external oxidant. The reactivity and product selectivity seen for Fe(III)Cz-NPs differs dramatically from that seen for the molecular species in organic solvents, suggesting that both the nanoparticle structure and the aqueous conditions may contribute to significant changes in the mechanism of action of the Fe(III)Cz catalyst."

Blood from consented volunteers was drawn into 3.2% citrate (9:1 v/v) and either used immediately or centrifuged to obtain platelet-poor plasma. Increasing concentrations of aptamer (6-24 microg/ml) alone or in combination with heparin (0.1 U/ml) or lepirudin (0.2 microg/ml) were added to blood and plasma samples. Activated clotting times (ACT+, low range-ACT), thrombelastometry (ROTEM) or thrombelastography (TEG) were performed in recalcified whole blood samples. Thrombin generation, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were performed in plasma samples. To some samples the antidote RB007 was added to neutralise the anticoagulation activity of RB006. In all experiment the ratio of RB006 to RB007 was kept 1:2. RB006 dose-dependently prolonged aPTT and low range-ACT, but, as expected, had no effect on PT. RB006 prolonged the lag time and decreased the peak of Actin-triggered thrombin generation. Thrombin-activated TEG demonstrated that RB006 decreases the rate of clot formation. These effects were potentiated when RB006 was combined with heparin or lepirudin. In all experiments RB007 reversed the effects of RB006 back to baseline. In conclusion, RB006 inhibits thrombin generation and clot formation in a concentration-dependent manner. It is feasible to monitor RB006 and its reversal with RB007 using aPTT, low range-ACT, and thrombin-activated TEG."

Our series includes 40 patients with benign cerebral or spinal lesions selected on the basis of a significant hemorrhagic risk. The activation of peroperatory recuperation is rapid and can be undertaken in extreme emergencies. It represents, even in elective surgery, a safety factor for the patient and the surgical team. The washing and the means of retransfusion by gravity eliminates all the inconveniences of preceding generations of these systems, particularly systemic residual anticoagulation, overload of free hemoglobin, blood coagulation problems and air embolism. In our study the number of unites recuperated is significant by reason of the selection modality of patients according to hemorrhagic risk.

The risk of infectious disease transmission was reduced for all these patients, it was annulled for 45% of them. In our study, autotransfusion by recuperation and washing of red blood cells in neurosurgery improves the safety of patients and allows for an important reduction in the use of homologous blood derivatives. This final result is even more effective through association, given the same patient, of several autotransfusion techniques."
CD010438,0,11680729,0,Assessment of the resonance thromboelastograph CS-3 for differentiation of coagulation disorders: a pilot in vitro investigation of simulated post-cardiopulmonary bypass coagulopathies.,"Resonance thromboelastography (RTG), a further development of the thromboelastogram (TEG), has been designed for improved differentiation of the effect of the plasmatic coagulation factors (increasing F-leg) and platelets (decreasing P-leg) on clot formation. It is based on the effect of clot elasticity on the resonance of a swinging wire. We assessed the RTG for its ability to differentiate coagulation disorders that frequently occur after cardiac surgery. The RTG was performed with a CS-3 Analyzer. Samples from 10 healthy volunteers were investigated after the following preparations: (1) baseline values, (2) dilution to a hematocrit of 30% and 20% with either hydroxyl ethyl starch (HES) 10% or plasma; (3) addition of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 IU/mL porcine heparin with and without heparinase; and (4) addition of 1.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 microg/mL of the antiplatelet agent abciximab (ReoPro). Increasing concentrations of abciximab led to a slower decrease or in the case of higher concentrations, to a persistent elevation of the platelet leg of the RTG. Dilution of the hematocrit with plasma had no effect on the fibrin and platelet leg; whereas, dilution with HES 10% led to an inhibition of the fibrin and platelet leg. Dilution of the plasmatic coagulation factors resulted in an inhibition of both the fibrin and the platelet leg. The addition of 0.25 and 0.5 IU/mL of heparin led to an increased coagulation time and inhibition of the fibrin and platelet legs. These effects were eliminated by the addition of heparinase. The RTG enables the evaluation of platelet function under the condition of a nonimpaired plasma coagulation system. Depletion of plasma coagulation factors and the administration of small amounts of heparin do not enable the distinction between residual effects of an anticoagulant, coagulation factor deficiency, or impaired platelet function. However, the heparin effects can be eliminated by the addition of heparinase. Further improvement may be achieved using a modified RTG by adding plasma coagulation factors in one channel for an improved evaluation of platelet function, even under the condition of a loss of procoagulants."

CD010438,0,19581800,0,Carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2 decreases fibrinolysis in human plasma.,"Carbon monoxide, derived from carbon monoxide-releasing molecules, has been recently demonstrated to enhance the velocity of formation and strength of plasma thrombi. We tested the hypothesis that carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2 would modulate fibrinolysis of plasma thrombi. Normal plasma was exposed to 0, 25, 50, 100 or 200 micromol/l carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2, with coagulation activated with tissue factor and fibrinolysis initiated with tissue-type plasminogen activator. Additional experiments utilized factor XIII, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor or alpha2-antiplasmin-deficient plasmas. Thrombus growth/disintegration kinetics was monitored with thrombelastography. Carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2, in a concentration-dependent fashion, increased the velocity of thrombus formation and strength, and markedly attenuated fibrinolysis in normal plasma. In factor XIII-deficient plasma, carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2 mediated effects on thrombus growth/disintegration kinetics were similar to that seen with normal plasma; however, carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2 had a less marked effect on thrombus growth/disintegration in both plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor-deficient plasma, with even less carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2-mediated effects noted in alpha2-antiplasmin-deficient plasma. Carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2 attenuated fibrinolysis by enhancing the velocity of clot growth and strength while augmenting the effects of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor and alpha2-antiplasmin. These findings serve as the rationale for further investigations to determine if carbon monoxide-releasing molecules could be utilized as hemostatic agents."

CD010438,0,2836259,0,[Prevention of thromboembolism in hysterectomies with low molecular weight heparin Fragmin].,"In comparison to standard heparins, the low-molecular types are said to have equal or better antithrombotic action and--since they affect coagulation less--to induce fewer hemorrhage complications. As they have a longer biologic half-life, a single subcutaneous injection per day is sufficient. In a prospective randomized study patients who had undergone vaginal and abdominal hysterectomy were given either the low-molecular heparin Fragmin (n = 95) or a combination of heparin-dihydergot (n = 98) as prophylaxis against thrombosis. Dosages of Fragmin were 2 X 2500 anti-Xa units on the day of surgery (Day 1) and 1 X 5000 anti-Xa units from Days 2 to 8; the dosage of heparin-dihydergot (HDHE) was 2 X 5000 IU heparin with 0.5 mg DHE from Days 1 to 8. There was no difference between the two groups with regard to the tendency to intraoperative bleeding, the incidence of severe wound hematomas and the postoperative hemoglobin course. Blood quantities in the drains were somewhat higher in the Fragmin group. Hemostasis studies showed that, also in patients on Fragmin, the activated partial thromboblastin time, thrombin time and reaction and clot formation time in the thromboelastogram are significantly prolonged three to four hours after injection. The heparin activity measured as the anti-Xa factor was higher by a factor of ten in patients on Fragmin than in those on HDHE. The thromboserate, recorded thermographically with the DeVeTherm unit, was the same in the two groups. Subjective acceptance of Fragmin prophylaxis was distinctly higher. Further studies to establish the required dose and show the effectiveness of low-molecule heparins seem necessary."
CD010438,0,17083509,0,Individualization of bypassing agent treatment for haemophilic patients with inhibitors utilizing thromboelastography.,"The treatment of bleeding for haemophilic patients with inhibitors relies on the use of the bypassing agents, recombinant factor VIIa and factor eight inhibitor bypass activity (FEIBA). While both therapies are effective in the majority of bleeding episodes, there is a significant amount of interindividual variability when it comes to the response to therapy. As of yet, there is no reliable laboratory parameter that can predict the response to therapy in the same manner that factor VIII and factor IX levels predict response in non-inhibitor patients. Developing such a laboratory parameter is vital in order to maximize the clinical efficacy of these agents. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a device, which assesses clot formation over time in whole blood and has several characteristics which suggest it may be an effective way to monitor bypass agent therapy. We studied the ability of TEG to individualize the treatment regimens of three patients with high titre inhibitors assessing the response to recombinant factor VIIa, FEIBA, and when both were used sequentially. The TEG allowed for individualization of treatment for each of the three patients and resulted in more effective, convenient and less expensive treatment regimens. We thus believe that TEG is a promising device for monitoring of bypass agent therapy and should be studied further."
CD010438,0,14717973,0,Whole blood clot formation phenotypes in hemophilia A and rare coagulation disorders. Patterns of response to recombinant factor VIIa.,"Until now, no routinely used clotting assay has demonstrated the power to reflect significantly a patient's response to recombinant factor (rF)VIIa. Adopting a thrombelastographic principle, profiles of continuous whole blood (WB) coagulation were studied in minimally altered WB activated with a small amount of tissue factor (TF). Investigation of the WB clotting profile was performed before and after ex vivo addition of rFVIIa 20 nm to WB from 26 patients with hemophilia A, two patients with severe hemophilia B, and individuals with deficiencies of FV, FX, FXI, and FXIII. In five patients with hemophilia plus inhibitors, the response to ex vivo added rFVIIa and to activated complex concentrate (APCC) was studied. Patients with severe and moderate hemophilia A demonstrated remarkable variance in the hemostatic characteristics at baseline, even in groups with the same FVIII:C activity levels. The response to rFVIIa at 20 nm also varied extensively, the effect correlating with the continuous WB coagulation phenotype at baseline. This indicates that the efficacy of rFVIIa may be optimized by tailoring the dose according to the hemostatic response to varying doses tested prior to in vivo administration. In patients with inhibitors against FVIII and factor IX, rFVIIa and APCC substitution resulted in quite similar response patterns that appeared to be dose dependent. In severe FV, FX, and FXIII-deficient WB, rFVIIa addition induced minor changes only. In FXI deficiency, rFVIIa normalized the dynamic properties of clotting, although a reduced clot firmness remained unchanged. In conclusion, the thrombelastographic analysis of WB clotting, as activated with a minute amount of TF, seems an interesting method that detects phenotypic variation amongst hemophilia patients. The method appears useful for assessment of the hemostatic capacity and it seems a promising tool for evaluation of the individual response to rFVIIa or APCC before and during in vivo administration."
CD010438,0,15502066,0,Decreased factor XIII availability for thrombin and early loss of clot firmness in patients with unexplained intraoperative bleeding.,"To explore relevant changes in unexplained intraoperative bleeding, we evaluated elements of the final steps of the coagulation cascade in 226 consecutive patients undergoing elective surgery. Patients were stratified for the occurrence of unexplained intraoperative bleeding according to predefined criteria. Twenty patients (8.8%) developed unexplained bleeding. The median intraoperative blood loss was 1350 mL (bleeders) and 400 mL (nonbleeders) (P < 0.001). Fibrinogen and Factor XIII (F. XIII) were more rapidly consumed in bleeders (P < 0.001). Soluble fibrin formation (fibrin monomer) was increased in bleeders throughout surgery (P < or = 0.014). However, F. XIII availability per unit thrombin generated was significantly decreased in bleeders before, during, and after surgery (P < or = 0.051). Computerized thrombelastography showed a parallel, significant reduction in clot firmness. We suggest that mild preexisting coagulopathy is not rare in surgical patients and probably can result in clinically relevant intraoperative bleeding. This hemostatic disorder shows impaired clot firmness, probably secondary to decreased cross-linking (due to a loss of F. XIII, both in absolute measures and per unit thrombin generated). We suggest that the application of F. XIII might be worthwhile to test in a prospective clinical trial to increase clot firmness in patients at risk for this intraoperative coagulopathy."

CD010438,0,11467435,0,"Quantitative evaluation of hypothermia, hyperthermia, and hemodilution on coagulation.","The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of temperature change on the coagulation time of blood at two different hematocrit levels by using various coagulation-monitoring devices. The devices used in this study were the Bayer Rapid Point Coag Analyzers, Hemochron Jr. Signature, Hemochron Response, Medtronic ACT II, and Haemoscope Thrombelastograph. One unit of human bank blood was used in this study. The hematocrit level was adjusted to 40% and 20%. A control bath and experimental bath were set up. Control blood was maintained at 37 degrees C and tested every 45 +/- 15 min throughout the experimental period of 6 h to demonstrate the stability of the model. The experimental blood was tested at temperature points of 37, 32, 27, 32, 37, 42, and 37 degrees C. Activated clotting time (ACT) tended to increase when the temperature was initially decreased from 37 to 27 degrees C, which reached a statistically significant level when measured by the Hemochron Response at both the 20% (147 +/- 10.7 to 159.3 +/- 11.0, p < .0332) and 40% hematocrit level (130 +/- 14.9 to 152.1 +/- 19.7, p < .0148). ACT was decreased significantly (p < .05) when the temperature was increased to 42 degrees C as measured by all machines except the Hemochron Jr. Signature at the 20% hematocrit level. ACT was significantly higher (p < .05) at a 20% hematocrit level as compared to that at a 40% hematocrit level on all devices for the majority of temperature points. These data suggested that hypothermia only increased ACT when measured by a macrosample device requiring a milliliter sample (Hemochron Response). However, hemodilution induced anticoagulatory effects and hyperthermia caused an acceleration in coagulation by all devices utilized in this study."
CD010438,0,14717978,0,Different effects of abciximab and cytochalasin D on clot strength in thrombelastography.,"Maximum amplitude (MA) in thrombelastography (TEG) consists of a plasmatic and a platelet component. To assess the magnitude of the plasmatic component, pharmacological approaches have been proposed to eliminate the platelet component. We evaluated the individual and combined effects of abciximab and cytochalasin D on the MA of TEG. Whole blood, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and homologous platelet-poor plasma (PPP) from 20 healthy volunteers were spiked with abciximab or cytochalasin D or a combination of both and TEGs performed. Abciximab and cytochalasin D decreased MA in all samples. MA of whole blood (18.6 +/- 3.1 mm) and PRP (33.7 +/- 3.5 mm) spiked with abciximab or cytochalasin D alone (15.0 +/- 2.9 mm and 25.0 +/- 4.0 mm) were significantly higher when compared with abciximab and cytochalasin D combined (10.4 +/- 3.0 and 20.2 +/- 3.5 mm). While MA of PRP and homologous PPP were significantly (P < 0.001) different after individual administration of abciximab and cytochalasin D, combination of both abolished this difference (20.2 +/- 3.5 mm and 20.4 +/- 3.7 mm, P = 0.372). In whole blood of critically ill patients or patients undergoing major surgery there was also a significant difference of MA between abciximab alone and in combination with cytochalasin D (16.5 +/- 11.3 mm and 11.3 +/- 7.7 mm, P < 0.001). This indicates that in contrast to individual administration of abciximab or cytochalasin D, a combination of both compounds eliminates the platelet-specific effect on MA of TEG tracings."

CD010438,0,16988549,0,Global assessment of the coagulation status in type 2 diabetes mellitus using rotation thromboelastography.,"Clinical and epidemiologic observations have led to the concept of a procoagulant state in type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to determine the coagulation status in type 2 diabetic patients using rotation thromboelastography (ROTEM), which measures the interactive dynamic coagulation process. For this purpose, 51 (30 women, 21 men) type 2 diabetic patients (mean age, 56.1 years) and 40 age-matched, sex-matched and body-mass-index-matched healthy individuals were enrolled. Twenty-seven of the diabetic group had diabetic vascular complications. ROTEM using different activators for the intrinsic and extrinsic systems of coagulation cascade (intrinsic TEM-INTEM, extrinsic TEM-EXTEM, FIBTEM) was used to measure the coagulation time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), alpha angle (alpha) and maximum clot firmness (MCF). No significant difference was found in the prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, fibrinogen and platelet count between the two groups. INTEM-CT and INTEM-CFT and EXTEM-MCF were significantly higher in the diabetic group compared with controls (P = 0.012, P = 0.007 and P = 0.029, respectively). INTEM alpha in the diabetic group was significantly lower than the controls (P = 0.001). All other parameters, including INTEM-MCF, EXTEM-CT, EXTEM-CFT, EXTEM-alpha, FIBTEM-CT, FIBTEM-CFT, FIBTEM-MCF and FIBTEM-alpha, were similar between the two groups. Taking into account these data, we conclude that there is subtle activation of the extrinsic pathway with a concomitant decrement in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade in type 2 diabetes. The exact underlying mechanisms leading to these changes, and their consequences with regard to diabetic complications, remain to be determined."
CD010438,0,19824410,0,[The efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid and epsilon-aminocapronic acid in cardiac surgery under extracorporeal circulation].,"Sixty patients who had undergone cardiosurgical operations under extracorporeal circulation (EC) were enrolled in the study. All the patients were divided into 2 groups: (1) 40 patients were injected tranexamic acid (TA) (its loading dose was 15 mg/kg; maintenance infusion 1 mg/kg/h throughout the operation; 500 mg in the primary packing volume for an EC apparatus (EA); (2) 20 patients received epsilon-aminocapronic acid (ACA) (its loading dose was 5 g; 5 g in the primary packing volume for an EA and 10 g for infusion after EC). The effects of TA and ACA on the fibrinolytic system were evaluated from the time of XIIa-kallikrein-dependent fibrinolysis (sec) and the concentration of D-dimer (mg/ml). The hemocoagulation system (activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin clotting time, prothrombin time with the determination of the international normalized ratio, fibrinogen) was studied. The thromboelastogram (the time R, K, and alpha-angle, MA) was analyzed. The indices were determined at the beginning and end of, and 12 hours after surgery. The analysis of the clinical efficacy and safety of the agents was based on the following perioperative data: the incidence of adverse reactions and complications associated with the administration of the agents, the frequency and amount of transfused donor blood components, the volume of blood loss, and the rate of resternotomies. The laboratory and clinical findings lead to the conclusion that TA (Tranexam, OOO ""MIR-PHARM"") has a 4-fold antifibrinolytic activity as compared with epsilon-ACA. The more pronounced TA-induced suppression of fibrinolysis affects the clinical course of a perioperative period in this group, which manifests itself as a reduced blood loss volume during and after surgery and a lower frequency of use of donor blood elements. By taking into account these data, TA may be recommended as one of the blood-preserving technology components during cardiosurgical operations under EC."

CD010438,0,8958389,0,A thromboelastography study on the in vitro effects of L-arginine and L-NG-nitro arginine methyl ester on human whole blood coagulation and fibrinolysis.,"The effects of L-arginine and L-NG-nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) on human blood coagulation and fibrinolysis were studied in vitro using computerized thromboelastography and native whole blood. L-Arginine (8-80 microM) prolonged the split point (SP), reaction time (R) and biKoatugulierung time (K); and diminished the angle (alpha), maximum amplitude (MA) and TEG index. L-NAME (0.5-50 microM) shortened SP, R and K and increased alpha, MA and the TEG index in a concentration-dependent manner. Neither L-arginine nor L-NAME had any effect on clot lysis. SP and R indicated the initiation of fibrin-strand formation, therefore L-arginine delayed, while L-NAME promoted the processes leading to fibrin formation. K and alpha reflect the rate of clot formation and involve fibrin build-up and platelets. Thus, L-arginine inhibited and L-NAME enhanced the rate of clot formation. MA (clot strength) involves the integrity of fibrin strands and platelet aggregation, and again L-arginine was inhibitory, while L-NAME enhanced this interaction. The TEG index indicates the coagulability of the sample; L-arginine was anticoagulant while L-NAME had procoagulant effects. These results are consistent with the inhibitory effects of NO on platelet function and of the platelet-aggregating properties of NOS inhibitors. In addition, NO may play an inhibitory role in the process leading to fibrin formation and also on the interactions between platelets and fibrin. Such effects may be important when considering the clinical use of drugs that affect the NO-cGMP pathway."

Therefore, 13 severely burned adult patients operated on during the first week after the trauma were studied. Blood loss was replaced with crystalloids, colloids and packed red cell concentrates (PRC). After ten infused PRCs, four fresh frozen plasma (FFP) units were given and thereafter one FFP unit with one PRC unit. Arterial blood samples were drawn before anaesthesia (SO), during operation after every four units of PRC transfusion (S1-4), 4 h postoperatively (S5) and on the first postoperative morning (S6). Prothrombin time (%) and activated partial thromboplastin time (s) were abnormal before operation (median values 67%, range 22-99% and 44 s, range 30-86 s, respectively). Prothrombin time decreased during operation and reached the critical level for normal haemostasis at S2. Thrombelastography showed decreased clot formation rate and impaired fibrin platelet interaction peri- and postoperatively. Fibrinogen and factor VIII activity were high preoperatively (median 6.1 g/l and 253%) and the critical values for normal haemostasis were not reached. Burned patients have a consumption coagulopathy which, in combination with haemodilution during operation, results in a clinically significant deficiency of coagulation factors II, VII and X, in spite of reactive elevation of coagulation factor VIII and fibrinogen."
CD010438,0,18645351,0,Mechanical circulatory device thrombosis: a new paradigm linking hypercoagulation and hypofibrinolysis.,"This review considers the perhaps unappreciated role of contact pathway proteins in the pathogenesis of thrombotic/thromboembolic morbidity associated with mechanical circulatory support. Placement of ventricular assist devices (VADs) has been associated with consumption of circulating contact proteins and persistent generation of activated contact proteins such as Factor XII and high molecular weight kininogen. Importantly, activated contact proteins are absorbed to the surface of VADs via the Vroman effect. Further, hyperfibrinogenemia and persistent platelet activation exist in patients with VADs, likely contributing to speed of clot growth. Using thrombelastographic-based analyses, it has been determined that contact pathway protein activated coagulation results in a thrombus that develops strength at a significantly faster rate that tissue factor initiated coagulation. Further, thrombelastographic analyses that include the addition of tissue-type plasminogen activator have demonstrated that contact protein pathway activation results in thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor activation to a far greater extent than that observed with tissue factor initiated coagulation, resulting in a thrombus that takes significantly longer to lyse. These observations serve as the rational basis for clinical investigation to determine if regional suppression of thrombin generation with FXII/high molecular weight kininogen inhibition in concert with thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor inhibition may decrease mechanical circulatory support-associated thrombotic morbidity."

We evaluated the relation between intraoperative salvaged blood transfusion produced by the Cell Saver 5 device (Haemonetics Corp., Braintree, MA, USA) and postoperative infection determined by bacteriological study and the postoperative clinical course after cardiac surgery. Seven cases of cardiac surgery were investigated by bacteriological study. Although bacteria were cultured from all salvaged blood, no bacteria were cultured from the patients' blood 24 hours after salvaged blood infusion. Another 26 patients who underwent cardiac surgery, were divided into groups: group CS (n = 15) with salvaged blood transfusion after operation and group N (n = 11) without salvaged blood transfusion, and were evaluated in relation to the postoperative clinical course. There were no statistically significant differences between group CS and group N in the data of WBC, CRP and maximum body temperature. One case of deep sternal wound infection and 2 cases of local wound infection were observed in group CS, but none in group N (p = 0.18). These complications were treated by primary closure without muscle flaps. We conclude that salvaged blood autotransfusion was not related to postoperative infections in cardiac surgery."

CD010438,0,19967151,0,A fusion protein with improved thrombolytic effect and low bleeding risk.,"To resolve the therapeutic dilemma between efficacy of thrombolysis and bleeding risk associated with the use of a combination of thrombolytic and anticoagulant treatments, we created a fusion protein. Staphylokinase was fused to the N-terminus of hirudin using thrombin recognition sequence as linker peptide, resulting in a fusion protein STH. We hypothesised that STH would be cleaved by thrombin at the thrombus site, releasing staphylokinase and hirudin to perform bifunctionally, and attenuating bleeding risk. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses indicated that the linker peptide could be specially recognised and cleaved by thrombin. Amidolytic and thromboelastogram assays showed that the N-terminus of hirudin in STH was blocked by staphylokinase and linker peptide, impeding hirudin's anticoagulant activity. Once cleaved, STH displayed 35.7% of the anticoagulant activity of equimolar hirudin and exhibited anticoagulant effects in the fibrin clot lysis assay. Thrombin-binding and fibrin clot lysis assays showed that the C-terminus of hirudin retained its high affinity for thrombin. Moreover, STH showed improved thrombolytic effects and a lower bleeding risk in animals. Thus, STH may have the capacity to perform bifunctionally and release anticoagulant activity in a thrombus-targeted manner in vivo, which may reduce the bleeding risk that often accompanies high thrombolytic efficacy in the treatment of thromboembolic diseases."

CD010438,0,19507243,0,A model for the interaction between NF-kappa-B and ASPP2 suggests an I-kappa-B-like binding mechanism.,"We used computational methods to study the interaction between two key proteins in apoptosis regulation: the transcription factor NF-kappa-B (NFkappaB) and the proapoptotic protein ASPP2. The C-terminus of ASPP2 contains ankyrin repeats and SH3 domains (ASPP2(ANK-SH3)) that mediate interactions with numerous apoptosis-related proteins, including the p65 subunit of NFkappaB (NFkappaB(p65)). Using peptide-based methods, we have recently identified the interaction sites between NFkappaB(p65) and ASPP2(ANK-SH3) (Rotem et al., J Biol Chem 283, 18990-18999). Here we conducted a computational study of protein docking and molecular dynamics to obtain a structural model of the complex between the full length proteins and propose a mechanism for the interaction. We found that ASPP2(ANK-SH3) binds two sites in NFkappaB(p65), at residues 236-253 and 293-313 that contain the nuclear localization signal (NLS). These sites also mediate the binding of NFkappaB to its natural inhibitor IkappaB, which also contains ankyrin repeats. Alignment of the ankyrin repeats of ASPP2(ANK-SH3) and IkappaB revealed that both proteins share highly similar interfaces at their binding sites to NFkappaB. Protein docking of ASPP2(ANK-SH3) and NFkappaB(p65), as well as molecular dynamics simulations of the proteins, provided structural models of the complex that are energetically similar to the NFkappaB-IkappaB determined structure. Our results show that ASPP2(ANK-SH3) binds NFkappaB(p65) in a similar manner to its natural inhibitor IkappaB, suggesting a possible novel role for ASPP2 as an NFkappaB inhibitor."

CD010438,0,7690649,0,[Comparative analysis of various plasmapheresis methods--modern procedures of mechanical plasma collection compared with each other and with manual bag centrifugation procedures].,"Four plasmapheresis procedures (manual blood bag centrifugation plasmapheresis, and the three plasmapheresis machines P.C.S./Haemonetics, Autopheresis-C/Baxter-Travenol, Plasmapur Monitor/Organon Teknika) were studied comparatively. The three machine procedures could be performed more easily and more rapidly and were well accepted by donors, autologous donors (patients) and staff. Compared with the traditional, well established manual procedure, a possible impairment of the plasma donors seems reduced rather than raised. Activation of the hemostatic system of the donors, measured with very sensitive methods, was found to be less pronounced when plasmapheresis was performed with the machines than when it was performed conventionally. The plasma product obtained by machine plasmapheresis was found to be of higher quality. All three systems showed less activation of the clotting system. Especially the plasma obtained by the P.C.S. showed a higher clotting factor yield. Plasma obtained by the Autopheresis-C and by the Plasmapur Monitor (both systems are equipped with filters) was markedly less contaminated with cells. The recently found low activation of the clotting system of plasma recipients, however, showed no differences when plasma obtained conventionally or by the Plasmapur Monitor was used. In summary, the new machine plasmapheresis devices offer a good alternative to the conventional blood bag centrifugation method and set new standards for the production of high quality plasma."
CD010438,0,10589626,0,Assessing platelet and fibrinogen contribution to clot strength using modified thromboelastography in pregnant women.,"The monoclonal antibody fragment c7E3 Fab (ReoPro), by binding to platelet surface fibrinogen receptors (glycoprotein, GPIIb/IIIa), inhibits platelet aggregation and its interaction with fibrinogen. In this study, we used thromboelastography with ReoPro to evaluate the independent contribution of fibrinogen and platelets to clot strength. Thromboelastography was performed in 21 healthy, term parturients scheduled for elective cesarean delivery with 360 microL of celite-activated whole blood and with 5 microL of (2 mg/mL) ReoPro added to 355 microL of celite-activated whole blood. The contribution of platelets to clot strength (MAplt) was derived by subtracting MAfib (maximal amplitude with ReoPro) from MAwb (maximal amplitude with whole blood). Thus, MAwb - MAfib = MAplt. The value for MAwb (mean +/- SD) was 73+/-4 mm, for MAfib it was 33+/-5 mm, and for MAplt it was 40+/-3 mm. The contribution of fibrinogen and platelets to the MAplt was 45% and 55%, respectively. Modified thromboelastography using ReoPro in healthy parturients can be used to determine the contribution of fibrinogen and platelets to blood clot strength."

This paper stressed on study the effects of YQHX therapy on blood coagulation process in vivo. The effects of several TCM preparations on CHD patients were observed by thromboelastography (TEG), prothrombin time, etc. After giving various preparations 20ml intravenously, the results of TEG showed that the values of r, k, c, 1 were decreased and ma increased by QiXue injection, the differences of k and ma were significant; while no significant change by Shen Qi injection and the k value was significantly reduced by DanShen injection. The results of prothrombin time with QiXue injection showed distinct dose-dependent effects, it shortened with 20ml and significantly lengthened with 40ml. This results suggested that there was complicated effects of different YQHX preparations as well as of different dosages."

Low-molecular-weight heparins are given increasingly to reduce the development of antibodies against the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex, and heparinoids are given to patients who have developed the antibody. We studied the effect of unfractionated heparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin sodium [Lovenox]), and a heparinoid (danaparoid sodium [Orgaran]) on blood clotting assayed with TEG (TEG clotting) in vitro and the efficacy of protamine sulfate and heparinase for reversing the effect. Heparin, enoxaparin, and danaparoid all caused a dose-dependent inhibition of TEG clotting of normal blood. Concentrations of enoxaparin and danaparoid that totally inhibited TEG clotting only minimally prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time. While inhibition of TEG clotting by heparin and enoxaparin was reversed by protamine sulfate and heparinase, inhibition by danaparoid was reversed only by heparinase. Abnormal TEG clotting was observed in patients receiving enoxaparin whose plasma level of the drug was more than 0.1 antiXa U/mL. However, the degree of TEG abnormality did not always coincide with plasma levels of the drug."

CD010438,0,10168534,0,Hemostatic assessment of patients undergoing intraaortic balloon pump therapy.,"Patients undergoing intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy are at risk for developing coagulopathies due to the adverse effects of prolonged exposure of the synthetic surface of the polyurethane balloon to blood components. Hemorrhagic risk has been attributed to a number of factors including thrombocytopenia, vascular injury, and/or platelet degranulation which increase the potential of receiving autogeneic blood transfusions. The present study is a prospective evaluation of coagulation using a viscoelastic monitor (Thrombelastograph--TEG) that measures functional aspects of clot development and stabilization in patients being treated with IABP therapy. Following Institutional Review Board approval, six patients undergoing IABP therapy for hemodynamic instability were enrolled in this study. Blood samples were taken prior to balloon insertion, at 8, 16, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours on IABP therapy, and 24 hours following the removal of the balloon when applicable. Samples were incubated with heparinase to degrade heparin and TEG profiles were subsequently determined in duplicate. Measured parameters on the TEG included R-time, K-time, maximum amplitude, alpha angle, and lysis at 30 and 60 minutes with calculation of the TEG index. Mortality was 33% following IABP discontinuation. Transfusion of packed red blood cells occurred in 50% of the patients during their balloon pump therapy. Patients demonstrated a significant deviance in fibrinolytic potential from pre-IABP lysis (1.6% +/- 1.8) at both 24 hours (18.8% +/- 22.9) and 48 hours (21.9% +/- 28.5) of therapy (p < 0.05) which returned to baseline shortly after balloon removal. Activation of coagulation factors appeared evident by a steadily increasing alpha angle from pre-IABP data (3.1 +/- 9.2) throughout the duration of therapy and 24 hour recovery (53 +/- 14; p < .005), and by a steadily trending increase in the TEG index pre-IABP (.251 +/- 1.4) to post-IABP (2.6 +/- 1.7; p < 0.05). The results indicate that IABP therapy induces an increase in fibrinolytic potential at 24 to 48 hours of balloon pump therapy with a paradoxical trend toward increased coagulability, potentially predisposing the patient to hemorrhagic risk."
CD010438,0,16812,0,Ditazole and platelets. I. Effect of ditazole on human platelet function in vitro.,"Ditazole (4,5-diphenyl-2-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-aminoxazol) has been shown to be a strong in vitro inhibitor of human platelet aggregation brought about by release reaction inducers; in contrast, it did not significantly affect primary ADP-induced aggregation. Ditazole strongly inhibited the release of platelet-bound 14C-serotonin under the influence of Thrombofax, whereas it did not interfere with the transport and storage of serotonin in nonstimulated platelets. The effect of ditazole was not potentiated by acetylsalicylic acid. Ditazole also inhibited ADP-reptilase clot retraction and modified thrombin-induced clot formation. The inhibition of platelet aggregation exerted by ditazole in plasma could be removed following gel filtration of platelets on Sepharose 2-B gel. This would indicate that ditazole does not act on platelets by a 'hit and run' mechanism."
CD010438,0,12538178,0,The influence of crystalloid and colloid replacement solutions in acute normovolemic hemodilution: a preliminary survey of hemostatic markers.,"Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH), in which blood for autologous use is collected immediately before the onset of surgical blood loss, is a recommended autologous blood procurement technique for blood conservation. Both crystalloid and colloid replacement fluids have been used to maintain normovolemia during ANH, but few data are available to justify the use of a particular replacement fluid. Therefore, we designed a prospective, randomized study to determine if the replacement fluid choice affects various coagulation variables and perioperative blood loss. Forty adult patients, ASA physical status 1-3, scheduled for ANH during radical prostatectomy were randomly assigned to one of four replacement fluid groups: (a) Ringer's lactate, (b) 5% albumin, (c) 6% dextran 70 (DEX), or (d) 6% hetastarch (HES). After the induction of a standardized general anesthetic, all patients underwent ANH to a final hemoglobin level of 9 g/dL. Complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, factors V and VIII levels, bleeding time, and thromboelastography (TEG measurements were obtained at similar time points in the procedure. When compared with baseline, activated partial thromboplastin time decreased and factor VIII levels increased in the postanesthesia care unit in both the Ringer's lactate and 5% albumin groups. The DEX and HES groups demonstrated a decrease in TEG maximum amplitude between preoperative and postanesthesia care unit measurements and TEG alpha (angle) was decreased from baseline in the DEX group. The changes in factor VIII, activated partial thromboplastin time, and TEG measurements indicate that HES and DEX may attenuate the hypercoagulability related to surgery."
CD010438,0,22876309,0,Coagulation changes during presyncope and recovery.,"Orthostatic stress activates the coagulation system. The extent of coagulation activation with full orthostatic load leading to presyncope is unknown. We examined in 7 healthy males whether presyncope, using a combination of head up tilt (HUT) and lower body negative pressure (LBNP), leads to coagulation changes as well as in the return to baseline during recovery. Coagulation responses (whole blood thrombelastometry, whole blood platelet aggregation, endogenous thrombin potential, markers of endothelial activation and thrombin generation), blood cell counts and plasma mass density (for volume changes) were measured before, during, and 20 min after the orthostatic stress. Maximum orthostatic load led to a 25% plasma volume loss. Blood cell counts, prothrombin levels, thrombin peak, endogenous thrombin potential, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor levels increased during the protocol, commensurable with hemoconcentration. The markers of endothelial activation (tissue factor, tissue plasminogen activator), and thrombin generation (F1+2, prothrombin fragments 1 and 2, and TAT, thrombin-antithrombin complex) increased to an extent far beyond the hemoconcentration effect. During recovery, the markers of endothelial activation returned to initial supine values, but F1+2 and TAT remained elevated, suggestive of increased coagulability. Our findings of increased coagulability at 20 min of recovery from presyncope may have greater clinical significance than short-term procoagulant changes observed during standing. While our experiments were conducted in healthy subjects, the observed hypercoagulability during graded orthostatic challenge, at presyncope and in recovery may be an important risk factor particularly for patients already at high risk for thromboembolic events (e.g. those with coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis or hypertensives)."
CD010438,0,23232448,0,Reconstruction of an extensive peri-orbital defect secondary to mucormycosis in a patient with myelodysplasia.,"We present the case of a 68-year old gentleman with previously diagnosed myelodysplastic syndrome with pancytopenia who presented with exophthalmia, rhinorrhea, and ophthalmoplegia. Nasal endoscopy revealed black necrotic lesions. He was diagnosed with rhino-orbital mucormycosis and commenced on intravenous antifungals. Despite this therapy he progressed to have total unilateral loss of visual acuity and cutaneous necrosis. He underwent emergency orbital exenteration and extensive cheek and sinus debridement. Necrotic lesions were found in the orbit, the maxillary and ethmoidal sinuses. He underwent reconstruction of this defect using a free myocutaneous ALT flap with a segment of vastus lateralis. Prior to surgery his anemia and thrombocytopenia were addressed with packed red cell and platelet transfusions as well as preoperative thromboelastography (TEG) to measure functional fibrinogen to platelet ratio. Intraoperative platelet administration was guided by repeated TEG analysis. There were no significant intraoperative or postoperative bleeding complications and both flap and donor site healed unremarkably. Few reports exist in the literature related to free tissue transfer in patients with hematological disorders but low platelet count has been implicated in an increased complication rate."

To investigate the role of FXIII we employed homologous recombination to generate a targeted deletion of the inferred exon 7 of the FXIII-A gene. FXIII transglutaminase activity in plasma was reduced to about 50% in mice heterozygous for the mutant allele, and was abolished in homozygous null mice. Plasma fibrin gamma-dimerization was also indetectable in the homozygous deficient animals, confirming the absence of activatable FXIII. Homozygous mutant mice were fertile, although reproduction was impaired. Bleeding episodes, hematothorax, hematoperitoneum and subcutaneous hemorrhage in mutant mice were associated with reduced survival. Arrest of tail-tip bleeding in FXIII-A deficient mice was markedly and significantly delayed; replacement of mutant mice with human plasma FXIII (Fibrogammin P) restored bleeding time to within the normal range. Thrombelastography (TEG) experiments demonstrated impaired clot stabilization in FXIII-A mutant mice, replacement with human FXIII led to dose-dependent TEG normalization. The mutant mice thus reiterate some key features of the human genetic disorder: they will be valuable in assessing the role of FXIII in other associated pathologies and the development of new therapies."
CD010438,0,15782557,0,Thrombelastography monitoring of platelet substitution therapy and rFVIIa administration in haemato-oncological patients with severe thrombocytopenia.,"Thrombocytopenic patients refractory to platelet concentrates (PC) could be treated during bleeding episodes with the recombinant activated FVII (rFVIIa). However, monitoring of administration of the rFVIIa or a response to platelet substitution therapy in thrombocytopenia patients is not well documented so far. Using of whole blood ROTEG analysis we monitored the changes in haemostatic parameters following in vivo platelet concentrate administration compared to ex vivo rFVIIa administration in patients with a severe to mild thrombocytopenia secondary to haemato-oncological disease. We use non-activated thrombelastography (NATEG) and a mild intrinsic activation thrombelastography (INTEG). NATEG analysis was sufficiently sensitive to monitor changes following PC and rFVIIa administration. Both, platelet infusion and rFVIIa treatment induced significant shortening of clotting time (CT) and clot formation time (CFT) parameters (p<0.05). When we compared the effect of platelet vs. rFVIIa treated whole blood by NATEG analysis we did not found any significant difference. Analysis with INTEG system was less sensitive and changes in CT and CFT were not significant. The monitoring with thrombelastography could enable efficient application of platelet concentrate and furthermore the using of rFVIIa as an alternative treatment of patients refractory to platelet infusion or with allergic reactions."

The sulfonation of depolymerized products was performed using chlorosulfonic acid in N,N-dimethylformamide under semi-heterogeneous conditions. The structures of the products were characterized by FTIR, (13)C NMR, and (1)H NMR (1D, 2D NMR) spectroscopy. The present study sheds light on the mechanism of anticoagulant activity of chitosan polysulfate. Anticoagulant activity was investigated by an activated partial thromboplastin assay, a thrombin time assay, a prothrombin time assay, and thrombelastography. Surface plasmon resonance also provided valuable data for understanding the relationship between the molecular binding of sulfated chitosan to two important blood clotting regulators, antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II. These results show that the principal mechanism by which this chitosan polysulfate exhibits anticoagulant activity is mediated through heparin cofactor II and is dependent on polysaccharide molecular weight."

To investigate this, the ability of RapidTEG, KaolinTEG, and functional fibrinogenTEG (FFTEG) to detect tPA-induced (tissue plasminogen activator) lysis in whole blood from healthy individuals was investigated. Our hypothesis was that the initial powerful clot formation in the RapidTEG assay would reduce the sensitivity as compared to the normally used KaolinTEG assay. We also evaluated the FFTEG assay."

CD010438,0,21467918,1,The prognostic value of thrombelastography in identifying neurosurgical patients with worse prognosis.,"Coagulopathy in patients with intracranial haemorrhage or traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with clinical deterioration and worse outcome. Whole blood viscoelastic haemostatic assays, like thrombelastography (TEG), might aid conventional coagulation assays in identification of patients with worse prognosis. We performed a review of patients (totalling 78 patients) with primary acute intracranial haemorrhage or isolated TBI admitted to a neurointensive care unit (NICU) for more than 24 h during a period of 9 months, who had TEG analysis performed at admission. Primary outcome was all-cause 30-day mortality, whereas decline in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at 24 h after admission or death due to cerebral incarceration were secondary outcomes. Patients were defined as hypocoaguable if TEG reaction time was more than 8 min, angle less than 55° and/or maximal amplitude less than 51 mm. Patients were defined hypocoaguable according to conventional coagulation assays if international normalized ratio was more than 1.3, platelet counts less than 100×10/l and/or activated partial thromboplastine time more than 35 s. Eight patients were hypocoaguable by TEG on admission to NICU and had higher 30-day mortality (63% vs. 16%, P=0.008), more often declined in GCS (57% vs. 16%, P=0.02) and expired due to cerebral incarceration (50% vs. 6%, P=0.02). Hypocoagulability by TEG, lower admission GCS and subarachnoid haemorrhage were independently associated with higher 30-day mortality [TEG: odds ratio (OR) 14.8 (2.2-100.1), P=0.006; GCS: OR 1.3 (1.1-1.5), P=0.006; subarachnoid haemorrhage: OR: 5.3 (1.3-22.3), P=0.02]. Only two patients were hypocoaguable by both conventional coagulation assays and TEG. The current data indicate that hypocoagulability by TEG at admission to NICU predicts worse prognosis. Low concordance with conventional coagulation assays indicates that TEG might be valuable in identifying patients with clinically relevant coagulopathy."

This study was undertaken to evaluate the hemostatic balance in the blood of PV patients by means of thromboelastography (TEG). The effect of isovolemic erythrocytapheresis (ECP) on the hemostasis of PV patients was also studied. We assessed the coagulation status of 76 PV patients undergoing ECP and 50 of healthy controls. TEG measurements were performed immediately before and after the ECP procedure. Coagulation was triggered by recalcification in freshly collected citrated blood. We recorded clotting time (R), alpha angle, and maximum amplitude (MA) of the clot. The results presented here show that, compared with healthy controls, PV patients demonstrated an increase in alpha angle (p<0.005) and in MA (p=0.14). In the subgroup of PV patients with high (>440 × 10(9)l(-1)) platelet (PLT) count, differences in MA (p<0.01) and alpha angle (p<0.001) were more significant. Following ECP procedure, a significant (p ≤ 0.01) reduction of R time, a rise of alpha angle, and MA were observed, indicating augmentation of a hypercoagulable state. In PV patients, the rise in alpha angle positively correlated (r=0.549) with platelet count but not with the number of erythrocytes and leukocytes. Following ECP, this correlation was reduced (r=0.382). Dilution (with saline) of blood from PV patients and of healthy controls, to a degree similar to that used during the ECP procedure, resulted in reduction of R and rise of the alpha angle. In conclusion, TEG measurements show that the majority of PV patients demonstrate abnormal hemostasis in which a major role is played by platelets rather than plasma factors. The hypercoagulable state in PV patients is significantly augmented following the ECP and may be related to the hemodilution intrinsically included in this procedure. TEG may help to assess the thrombotic risk in individual PV patients."

Seventeen OPCAB and six cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) patients were studied pre- and postprocedure, as well as on each of the first three postoperative days (POD). In the OPCAB patients, there was a small reduction in the postprocedure coagulation index (CI). This was followed by an increase in the CI on each of the next three POD, reaching a level exceeding the mean preprocedure CI by 2.32 units, indicative of a state of relative hypercoagulability. The mean CI for the CPB patients decreased significantly in the postprocedure sample. Over the next 72 h, the CI increased to a level that nearly equaled the preprocedure 'baseline'. We concluded that our study identified a state of relative hypercoagulability in the OPCAB patient 72 h after surgery. The mechanism of this hypercoagulation, as well as the clinical significance of this finding, is yet to be determined."

The platelet units contained a mean of 4.4 x 10(11) platelets/unit and were nearly devoid of leukocytes. The combined granulocyte-platelet units contained a mean of 7.38 x 10(9) neutrophils/unit and 3.06 x 10(11) platelets/unit.

All patients received 3 x 70 IU heparin/kg per day s.c. from 2 days before operation. No thromboembolic events were associated with epoetin beta therapy during the study period. The thrombocytic parameters showed no significant changes in the placebo group before surgery, and the preoperative hematocrit increase in the epoetin beta group was accompanied with an MPV drop (in contrast to the known MPV rise in recombinant human erythropoietin-treated patients with uremia) by a mean of 0.85 fl and a platelet distribution width rise by 3.3% without a significant change in platelet count. In the epoetin beta group the coagulation time (K) of thromboelastogram (TEG) showed an increase from 4.8 to 5.4 minutes by the seventh study day and after the initiation of heparin therapy a further increase to 7.5 minutes. The higher preoperative K increase in the epoetin beta group may partly be a result of the MPV reduction, because smaller platelets are less reactive, a fact underlined by the negative correlation between the preoperative changes of MPV and reaction time of TEG (r = -0.58, p = 0.0148). In contrast, in the placebo group the K of TEG increased only after the start of heparin therapy (from 5.1 to 6.4 minutes). The significant drop in MPV in the epoetin beta group and the higher increase in K of TEG and the other investigated hemostatic parameters do not suggest any increased thromboembolic risk during the preoperative epoetin beta therapy. Therefore this treatment seems to be a safe way for increasing mean hematocrit by approximately 0.06 within the normal range and reducing the homologous blood requirement in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery."
CD010438,0,432930,0,The effects of combined platelet and leukapheresis on the blood coagulation system.,"Analysis of blood coagulation was done on samples of blood collected from ten donors undergoing combined platelet and leukapheresis using the Haemonetics Model 30 Blood Processor. Blood samples were obtained from the donors prior to, during, and following pheresis. Blood was also obtained from the blood-return line after the first collection of leukocytes and platelets, but before it was returned to the donor. Although the citrate anticoagulant was returned to the donor and there were some decreases in the concentrations of fibrinogen, platelets, and factors V and VIII, there were no changes of sufficient degree to suggest that development of a potential bleeding disorder. In addition there was no evidence to suggest that any activation of blood coagulation occurred during the pheresis or that thrombogenic substances were returned to the donors. Combined platelet and leukapheresis using the Haemonetics Model 30 Blood Processor, therefore, do not appear to subject the donor to risks for either bleeding or thrombotic complications."

CD010438,0,19166709,0,Methods for the measurement of platelet function.,"This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of methods for the measurement of platelet function. The focus is on tests that can be used to monitor antiplatelet activity in the setting of cardiovascular disease and potentially predict thrombosis and bleeding. The tests described are platelet aggregometry; impedance aggregometry; VerifyNow (Accumetrics, San Diego, CA); Plateletworks (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX); platelet surface P-selectin, platelet surface-activated glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, and leukocyte-platelet aggregates; TEG Platelet Mapping system (Haemoscope, Niles, IL); Impact cone and plate(let) analyzer (DiaMed, Cressier, Switzerland); Platelet Function Analyzer-100 (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc., Deerfield, IL); phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; serum thromboxane B(2); and urinary 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2). Some of the factors that differentiate these tests are sample volume requirements, the use of whole blood, the presence of shear, point-of-care status, need for a technician, and expense."

Patients with hematological malignancies represent only 0.38% of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The literature in this subset of patients is limited to only a few retrospective case series, with limited number of patients undergoing emergency cardiac surgery. We describe three cases with hematological malignancies namely chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia presenting for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Two patients were taken up for emergency CABG in view of ongoing ischemia, one of them was on preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump support. No mortality was observed. Two patients needed transfusion of blood products which was guided by thromboelastography. One patient developed superficial sternal wound infection requiring antibiotic therapy."

CD010438,0,14564249,0,Thrombelastography. Present and future perspectives in clinical practice.,"Thrombelastography (TEG) is a method for evaluating the viscoelastic properties of the blood clot, from its formation to its lysis. All major surgeries may be associated with massive blood loss, with blood component transfusion therapy often becoming mandatory. The clinician's goal is thus to optimize and possibly minimize blood components usage. To this end, TEG allows for a qualitative and dynamic analysis of the specific blood clotting process, from clot formation through its lysis, highlighting alterations at every single step in the cascade. With TEG is thus possible to know if bleeding is due to a failure to provide adequate surgical hemostasis, if there is platelet dysfunction, or to detect anomalies in coagulation proteases or their inhibitors, or if the blood loss is associated to early, excessive fibrinolysis. The theoretical advantages of TEG are the ease of performing the test, the fast sample reading times (now 30 minutes) and the informative"
CD010438,0,9160366,0,Coagulopathic-induced membrane dysfunction during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a case report.,"This paper describes an unusual complication of membrane dysfunction during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for treatment of neonatal respiratory distress. A 2.8-kg term infant presented to our facility in severe respiratory distress and was diagnosed with primary pulmonary hypertension. After routine priming of the extracorporeal circuit, the patient was placed on veno-arterial ECMO with 8 F arterial and 12 F venous cannulae. Transfusion criteria were established which included trigger values of the following: platelet count 100,000/microliters, fibrinogen 150 mg/dl, haematocrit 40%. The ECMO course was uneventful until approximately the 132nd hour on support when the patient developed a consumptive coagulopathy, as evidenced by 55-60% reductions in both platelet count and fibrinogen concentrations, despite transfusion therapy. Total autogeneic blood product transfusion during the first 120 h of ECMO averaged 4.4 +/- 2.2 ml/h, while the transfusion rate for the final 35 h was 7.8 +/- 3.5 ml/h. Coinciding with this rise in transfusion requirements was an increase in transmembrane pressure from 0.29 to 1.52 mmHg/ml blood flow. The patient was separated from ECMO after 175 h due to a continuing coagulopathy and haemothorax. The patient was then treated with nitric oxide therapy before succumbing on the twelfth postoperative day due to refractory respiratory failure. The circuit was dissected and significant clots found in both the venous bladder and oxygenator. In addition, approximately one-third of the membrane compartment had a 'fused' circumferential pattern of dessicated clot which interrupted blood path continuity. In conclusion, this report describes an unusual complication of the ECMO oxygenator that occurred during long-term extracorporeal life support which most likely resulted from a coagulopathy."
CD010438,0,20581663,0,Factor VIIa analog has marked effects on platelet function and clot kinetics in blood from patients with hemophilia A.,"To evaluate the hemostatic effects of NN1731 and rFVIIa, an ex-vivo study in hemophilia patients used the Hemodyne Hemostasis Analysis System (HAS) to measure platelet contractile force (PCF), clot elastic modulus (CEM), and force onset time (FOT), and the Haemoscope Thrombelastograph (TEG) to measure reaction time (R), kinetics time (K), and maximum amplitude (MA). Blood samples from 10 healthy volunteers and 10 Factor VIII-deficient patients of varying severity (mild, moderate, severe), were spiked with rFVIIa and NN1731 (both 0.64 and 1.28 microg/ml, respectively) and analyzed to characterize platelet function and clot kinetics. There was wide variability in the rFVIIa response. NN1731 had greater and more consistent effects on PCF, CEM, FOT, R, and K relative to rFVIIa, in all hemophilia groups. The lowest NN1731 concentration (0.64 microg/ml) shortened R and FOT, and increased CEM and PCF more than rFVIIa 1.28 microg/ml. NN1731 normalized clotting parameters equivalent to values obtained in healthy volunteers. FOT and R were highly correlated (r = 0.96). No correlation was observed between CEM and MA. NN1731 produced less variable, more pronounced and predictable ex-vivo hemostatic effects on PCF, CEM, FOT, R and K than rFVIIa in all hemophilia groups. HAS and TEG assays provided similar estimates of FOT and R, however CEM appeared to be more sensitive than MA to changes in clot firmness."

CD010438,0,18766254,0,Interspecies differences in coagulation profile.,"Many animals are used in research on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, but the relevance of animal models to human health is often questioned because of differences between species. The objective was to find an appropriate animal species, which mimics the coagulation profile in humans most adequately. Species differences in the coagulation profile with and without thrombin stimulation in vitro were assessed in whole blood by Rotation Thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Endogenous thrombin generation was measured in platelet-poor plasma. Measurements were performed in blood from five different species: humans, rats, pigs, sheep and rabbits. In humans and sheep, the clotting time (ROTEM) was in the same range with or without thrombin stimulation and a 100-fold lower dose of thrombin (0.002 IU) was required to cause a shortening in the clotting time as compared to rats, pigs and rabbits (0.2 IU) (p<0.05). Similarly, the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) was in the same range in humans and sheep. The maximum clot firmness with or without thrombin stimulation was similar in rabbits and humans. The maximum lysis with or without thrombin stimulation was similar in humans and pigs. Significant species differences exist in the coagulation profile with or without thrombin stimulation. Most importantly, sheep had a clotting time most similar to humans and could thus be a suitable species for translational coagulation studies. Moreover, our findings confirm the potential usefulness of pigs as an experimental species to study fibrinolytic pathway and support the usefulness of rabbits as a species for examining platelets."
CD010438,0,7424983,0,Red cell exchange in the pregnancy complicated by a major hemoglobinopathy.,"A new method of partial erythrocyte exchange for pregnancies complicated by a major hemoglobinopathy is described. The Haemonetics 30 Cell Separator allows efficient withdrawal and discard of the patient's erythrocytes. The patient's leukocytes, platelets, and plasma are conserved and returned with washed, compatible donor red cells which contain Hb AA. Three pregnant black women with significant hemoglobinopathies were treated by this modality during their pregnancies. Vaginal term deliveries were accomplished in each case. The method offers advantages in the efficiency of blood quantity displacement, patient comfort, adaptability to the patient with severe anemia, and the use of outpatient facilities. The method is suggested for use whenever a patient with an obstetrically significant hemoglobin variant needs transfusions of erythocytes."
CD010438,0,14661565,0,[Massive bleeding due to hyperfibrinolysis during living-related liver transplantation for terminal liver cirrhosis; report of two cases].,"We reported two cases of massive bleeding due to critical hyperfibrinolysis during living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) for end stage liver cirrhosis. The total volume of bleeding amounted to 57930 ml with the case 1, and amounted to 55980 ml with the case 2. TEG was useful for diagnosis of the hyperfibrinolysis. We administrated large amounts of FFPs, MAPs, PLTs, and gabexate mesilate. By rapid transfusion, we could manage to finish the procedures without hypotension, and complications were not observed at the early postoperative stage. We thought that the cause of the hyperfibrinolysis is the increasing blood tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) due to long-anhepatic stage and small graft size. During anesthesia, since the functional start of a transplant liver is indispensable to it, in order to support a transplant liver for an improvement of hyperfibrinolysis, it is important to keep the homeostasis, such as body temperature, blood pressure."

During autotransfusion red blood cells should be separated and washed in physiological saline to remove plasma free haemoglobin, potassium, intracellular enzymes and triglycerides as well as anticoagulant, activated clotting factors and debris. After knowing the mechanism of the recently developed autotransfusion devices (Haemonetics Cell Saver or Dideco Autotrans) acceptance of this procedure is very high in anaesthesiologists and surgeons due to microelectronic equipment. Considering the contraindications (bacterial contamination of the operative field and cancer surgery) intra- and postoperative autotransfusion is a very safe procedure for the patient undergoing major operations."

CD010438,0,20664906,0,Differential sensitivity and kinetics of response of different ex vivo tests monitoring functional variability of platelet response to clopidogrel.,"We previously showed that variability of response to clopidogrel is linked to occupancy of the P2Y12 receptor by clopidogrel active-metabolite, and that maximal platelet aggregation intensity (MAI) measured by light transmission aggregometry (LTA) correlates with occupancy. The present study compared a range of ex vivo platelet tests at various levels of P2Y12 occupancy. After screening with clopidogrel 75 mg/day for seven days, subjects were selected to obtain 'low', 'average' and 'high' responders and randomised to clopidogrel (75 mg/day days 1-10; 300 mg day 11), or placebo. Assays were LTA in platelet-rich plasma using 2, 5 and 20 mM ADP, VerifyNow P2Y12, flow cytometric analysis of platelet activation markers and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) index, and a thromboelastographic test that is sensitive to clopidogrel. The reference test was P2Y12 receptor occupancy, measured by binding of 33P-2MeS-ADP to platelets. MAI showed the best correlation with P2Y12 occupancy. Similar results were seen with different ADP concentrations and when LTA data were expressed as inhibition of platelet aggregation. A plot of free receptors/cell versus VASP index was biphasic, with poor correlation for low-level P2Y12 occupancy. Sensitivity of the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay decreased at higher clopidogrel responses. Thromboelastography and P-selectin expression had poor correlation with receptor occupancy. In conclusion, LTA data correlate best with P2Y12 occupancy, the gold standard for detecting clopidogrel's effect at the receptor level. Our results highlight a limitation of the VASP index, which appears unable to distinguish low, average and high responders early after clopidogrel initiation when P2Y12 occupancy is still low."

CD010438,0,16270349,0,New physically and chemically crosslinked hyaluronate (HA)-based hydrogels for cartilage repair.,"When dissolved in aqueous solutions, sodium hyaluronate substituted with low amounts of alkyl chains [amphiphilic hyaluronate (HA)] can give rise to hydrogels thanks to intermolecular reversible hydrophobic interactions, leading to a three-dimensional (3D) network. Such hydrogels possess shear-thinning properties and can thus be injected in cartilage defect to promote chondrocyte proliferation and cartilage repair. However, these hydrogels are only physically crosslinked and can progressively loose their 3D structure when they are in contact with aqueous fluids. To overcome this drawback, HA derivatives substituted with dodecyl chains were chemically crosslinked by a difunctional reagent, tetraethylene glycol ditosylate (TEG-diOTs). To preserve the shear-thinning properties of amphiphilic HA, small amounts of TEG-diOTs were used so as to obtain a low chemical crosslinking ratio. After optimization of the synthesis parameters, aqueous solutions of the HA derivatives, crosslinked both physically and chemically, were obtained, with rheological properties improved compared to the amphiphilic polymers. As the hydrogels are aimed to cartilage repair, they were sterilized by wet heating; the effect of this treatment on the polymer characteristics was analyzed by different techniques. A similar study was carried out on HA derivatives stored under conditions mimicking physiological ones."
CD010438,0,18264612,0,The utility of thrombo-elastography in the monitoring of aspirin therapy.,"To assess the utility of the thrombo-elastogram in monitoring of aspirin therapy 25 healthy volunteers were selected and given low-dose aspirin therapy. Thrombo-elastography and platelet aggregometry were conducted at baseline and 1 week later. After 1 week of aspirin therapy, thrombo-elastogram data failed to demonstrate a significant change in the clotting profile. Platelet aggregometry identified significant changes in the clotting profile in response to stimulation with arachidonic acid, adrenaline and ADP. We conclude that thrombo-elastography may not have utility in monitoring of response to aspirin."
CD010438,0,12701115,0,Effects of human mast cell tryptase and eosinophil granule proteins on the kinetics of blood clotting.,"Hypereosinophilic syndromes are often associated with thrombosis through unclear mechanisms, and mastocytosis has been associated with a variety of bleeding disorders. The present studies were aimed at defining the roles and interactions of eosinophil and mast cell constituents on the kinetics of blood clotting as measured by thromboelastograms. Eosinophil granule proteins and purified eosinophil peroxidase markedly reduced the anticoagulant properties of the mast cell tryptase/heparin complex. Moreover, eosinophil peroxidase by itself functioned as a powerful procoagulant and also inhibited the anticoagulant actions of heparin in a chromogenic assay for antithrombin III/factor Xa activity. The anticoagulant activity of the tryptase/heparin complex was attributable exclusively to the associated heparin and not to the intrinsic enzymatic activity of tryptase. Eosinophil granule proteins also strongly inhibited the enzymatic activity of tryptase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, thus implicating a critical role for eosinophil peroxidase. We conclude that eosinophil granule proteins and eosinophil peroxidase both function as powerful procoagulants and also inhibit the anticoagulant and enzymatic activities of mast cell tryptase. The present results thus provide a mechanistic rationale for the well-established link between certain eosinophilic inflammatory disorders and hypercoagulant states. They also suggest that eosinophils may play an important role in neutralizing the anticoagulant activity of mast cell tryptase/heparin in various diseases."
CD010438,0,8638778,0,Continuous small-dose aprotinin controls fibrinolysis during orthotopic liver transplantation.,"Large doses of aprotinin (1,000,000-2,000,000 kallikrein inhibitor units [KIU] initial dose and a 500,000 KIU/h infusion) have been used during orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) to reduce the incidence and severity of fibrinolysis. This double-blinded study was designed to investigate whether a small-dose infusion of aprotinin (200,000 KIU/h) would control fibrinolysis. A controlled study was undertaken to compare small-dose aprotinin with a placebo in patients undergoing OLT with veno-venous bypass. Forty-four patients were randomized either to the aprotinin group (n = 21), which received an intravenous infusion of 200,000 KIU/h without an initial dose, or to a control group (n = 23), which received normal saline. Coagulation variables, thrombelastograms, and postoperative blood drainage were measured. Blood levels of fibrin degradation products (FDP) were significantly higher in the control group (95% > 20 micrograms/mL) at the end of surgery compared to the aprotinin group (53% > 20 micrograms/mL, P < 0.01). The transfusion of cryoprecipitate units was more in the control group versus the aprotinin (12.6 +/- 12.8 vs 5.7 +/- 7.5; P < 0.04), as was the number of fresh frozen plasma units (6.6 +/- 3.5 vs 3.6 +/- 6.1; P < 0.05). We conclude that an infusion of a small dose of aprotinin can safely control fibrinolysis during liver transplantation with a concomitant reduction in transfusion of blood products."
CD010438,0,12635393,0,The effects of a one unit blood donation on auto-haemodilution and coagulation.,"The effect of haemodilution on coagulation has been extensively investigated. We investigated auto-haemodilution following a 10% blood loss (480 ml) and its effect on coagulation. Ten healthy, unstarved volunteers were enrolled. One unit of blood was taken from each volunteer. Concurrently blood was taken from the opposite arm prior to and immediately after the blood donation, and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours. It was tested for thrombelastography, haematocrit and endorphins. There was a significant decrease in r-time from the control sample to the sample taken immediately post blood donation. This value returned to baseline at 1 hour post donation and did not change again. There were no other significant changes in thromboelastographic parameters. Fractional plasma noradrenaline changes were significantly raised at 1 hour post donation (P = 0.048), returning to baseline by 2 hours post donation. The haematocrit showed a rapid (approximately 4%) fall during donation followed by a slow, but progressive decrease over six hours, falling by a mean of 8.3% from pre-donation values. A state of relative hypercoagulability is found immediately after a rapid 10% loss in circulating blood volume. This may be related to the rapid immediate haemodilution. It is unlikely that the sympathetic response to blood loss plays a role. However, after the initial drop, slow restoration of circulating blood volume by autodilution takes six to eight hours, and is not associated with enhanced coagulation. Of interest is that a 10% blood loss in a healthy person does not require volume replacement."
CD010438,0,22767647,0,Alterations in rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) parameters: point-of-care testing vs analysis after pneumatic tube system transport.,"Thromboelastometry as point-of-care (POC) testing enables the analysis of the clotting process at the bedside, providing rapid results to guide haemostatic therapy. However, POC testing utilizes medical staff who are managing critically ill patients, as non-laboratory personnel may not be sufficiently trained to run the devices. To resolve these problems, thromboelastometry can be performed in the central laboratory and rapid transport of samples can be accomplished via a pneumatic tube system (PTS). This study compares thromboelastometry parameters of blood samples analysed immediately with those analysed after PTS transport."
CD010438,0,21681082,0,Overcoming delayed in-vitro response to rFVIIa: effects of rFVIIa and rFVIIa analogue (vatreptacog alfa) concentration escalation in whole blood assays.,"In a previous pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study in nonbleeding hemophilia patients, variability in laboratory response to recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) 90 μg/kg was noted, and the patients were described as delayed or rapid laboratory responders based on time to clot formation. The current study determined whether in-vitro experiments could reproduce previous in-vivo findings; whether the delayed laboratory response to rFVIIa 90 μg/kg is improved by spiking with high-dose rFVIIa or rFVIIa analogue (vatreptacog alfa); whether a dose-response is observed with our method. In-vitro experiments were conducted in our previous patient cohort using rFVIIa 1.28 and 3.84 μg/ml and vatreptacog alfa 0.28 and 0.56 μg/ml. Whole blood studies were conducted using the Hemodyne Hemostasis Analysis System (platelet contractile force, clot elastic modulus, force onset time) and rotational thromboelastometry (clotting time, maximum clot firmness). Spiking with rFVIIa 1.28 μg/ml showed the same distribution of delayed and rapid laboratory response as observed previously. Increasing in-vitro rFVIIa concentrations improved the coagulation parameters; however, there remained delayed and rapid responders. Vatreptacog alfa improved the coagulation parameters at all concentrations tested, and the 0.56 μg/ml concentration normalized the force onset time, platelet contractile force, clot elastic modulus and clotting time parameters. A dose-response was observed with both assays. There was good agreement between the laboratory responses obtained after intravenous administration of rFVIIa 90 μg/kg and in-vitro spiking studies. Escalating rFVIIa and vatreptacog alfa concentrations improved coagulation parameters in all patients compared to rFVIIa 1.28 μg/ml. Vatreptacog alfa produced more pronounced coagulation effects at lower concentrations than rFVIIa; and the 0.56 μg/ml concentration completely normalized responses in all patients."

CD010438,0,7072194,0,Leucocyte-depleted blood: a comparison of cell-washing techniques.,"Non-haemolytic febrile transfusion reactions are common in multi-transfused patients. It is generally accepted that the majority of these reactions occur when more than 0.5 x 10(9) leucocytes are transfused. Values equal to or lower than this threshold, which we have called for convenience the critical antigenic load for leucocytes (CALL), can be achieved by decreasing the leucocyte content in one unit of whole stored blood by about 80%. We have compared the efficiency of leucocyte depletion of whole stored blood, using fixed-speed centrifugation (Haemonetics Model 15 and Model 115 cell washer), variable-speed centrifugation (Dideco Progress 90 Cell Separator), and serial centrifugation (IBM 2991 Blood Cell Processor. Fixed-speed centrifugation was least effective in depletion leucocytes; a reduction of 25 and 60% was achieved using the Haemonetics Model 15 and Model 115, respectively. Variable speed and serial centrifugation produced more satisfactory results with leucocyte depletions of 82 and 89% using the Dideco Progress 90 Cell Separator and the IBM 2991 Blood Cell Processor, respectively. Platelet depletion of over 90% was achieved with all the cell washers, except the Haemonetics Model 15. Red cell losses varied from 3 to 30%. It seems unlikely that consistently high (over 90%) leucocyte depletion can be obtained using cell-washing techniques without associated high red cell losses."
CD010438,0,1171400,0,Local alterations of hemostatic-fibrinolytic mechanisms in reforming subdural hematomas.,"Multiple chemical and coagulation determinations were undertaken on the subdural hematoma fluid from the reformed effusions of two patients. It was found that plasma or blood repeatedly reentered the subdural cavity. Coagulation studies compared the in vitro effects of subdural fluid with those of cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and a buffer control. Despite some chemical differences, the subdural fluids from both patients behaved similarly by (1) accelerating the intrinsic clotting system, (2) producing defective clot formation, and (3) accelerating the fibrinolytic system. It is presumed that these continuous hemostatic-fibrinolytic alterations, acting in the subdural sac, may have important implications in the growth and reformation of subdural hematomas, and a hypothesis of the mechanisms involved is presented."

CD010438,0,8881617,0,Thrombelastography changes in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.,"We have measured platelet count, bleeding time and thrombelastography (TEG) variables and the correlation between these variables in 49 pregnant patients presenting with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. Eighteen patients (37%) had a platelet count < or = 150 x 10(9) litre-1 and seven (14%) had a platelet count < or = 100 x 10(9) litre-1. Bleeding time was prolonged > 9.5 min in 13 (27%) patients and the TEG was abnormal in four (8%). The TEG variables, k time and maximum amplitude (MA) had a strong correlation with platelet count (k time-platelet count < or = 150 x 10(9) litre-1, r = -0.68, P = 0.003, platelet count < or = 100 x 10(9) litre-1, r = -0.84, P = 0.02; MA--platelet count < or = 150 x 10(9) litre-1, r = 0.72, P = 0.001, platelet count < or = 100 x 10(9) litre-1, r = 0.78, P = 0.04). There was no correlation between bleeding time and thrombocytopenia (platelet count < or = 150 x 10(9) litre-1, r = -0.18, ns; platelet count < or = 100 x 10(9) litre-1, r = 0.09, ns). There was no correlation between bleeding time and any measured TEG variable. Of the 10 (20%) patients with an adequate platelet count (> 100 x 10(9) litre-1) but prolonged bleeding time, the TEG was normal, suggesting adequate haemostasis. An MA of 53 mm, which is the lower limit for normal pregnancy, correlated with a platelet count of 54 x 10(9) litre-1 (95% confidence limits 40-75 x 10(9) litre-1). Although the number of patients with severe thrombocytopenia was small, a platelet count of 75 x 10(9) litre-1 should be associated with adequate haemostasis."

CD010438,0,12590956,0,Regulation of clot retraction by glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists.,"Binding of fibrinogen to platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa induces clot retraction. Significant differences among GP IIb/IIIa antagonists were previously noted to inhibit thromboelastography in whole blood specimens. The relationship between efficacy of these agents and inhibition of clot retraction is unclear. Here, we use a plasma-free clot retraction assay to evaluate potency of GP IIb/IIIa antagonists to inhibit clot retraction and modulate platelet signaling, and to address whether these effects are realized in the clinically relevant dose range. The potencies for inhibition of clot retraction and aggregation are similar for antagonists with high affinity for resting platelets and slow off-rates, whereas lower affinity and fast off-rate antagonists are disproportionately less effective in blocking clot retraction. A positive correlation is observed between inhibition of clot retraction and inhibition of tyrosine dephosphorylation across a number of GP IIb/IIIa antagonist pharmacophores. For lower affinity and fast off-rate antagonists, the concentrations required for inhibition of clot retraction clearly exceed the clinical dose range. Site occupancy studies combined with clot retraction experiments addressed whether high affinity and slow off-rate compounds can alter clot retraction during the dosing interval. Binding studies using [3H] Roxifiban, a high affinity GP IIb/IIIa antagonist, indicate that occupancy of >95% of GP IIb/IIIa sites is required to inhibit clot retraction. This level of occupancy is not routinely achieved in the clinic and is not tolerated, at least for chronic therapy. These results suggest that inhibition of clot retraction is not necessary for efficacy of GP IIb/IIIa antagonists."

The etiology for this increased thrombogenecity is incompletely understood. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of TE in Danish Fontan patients and to bring new insights into the etiology of TE. Using a population-based design, we retrospectively identified all TEs in 210 Fontan patients. Whole blood assays (thromboelastography, thromboelastography functional fibrinogen and Multiplate) reflecting global hemostasis, clot strength and platelet aggregation were analyzed prospectively in 112 patients and plasma was analyzed in 76 patients for biomarkers reflecting endothelial-, glycocalyx-, platelet-, and fibrinolysis function (histone-complexed DNA fragments, Protein C, soluble CD40 ligand, soluble thrombomodulin, syndecan-1, tissue-type plasminogen activator). The results were compared in groups stratified according to age, antithrombotic therapy, TE, and glycocalyx degradation (syndecan-1 < or ≥ median). Correlation between biomarkers and demographic-, anatomical-, clinical- and biochemical parameters was investigated. The prevalence of TE was 8.1 % after a mean follow-up of 8.4 years. None of the stratified groups demonstrated evidence of hypercoagulability in the whole blood assays and no unexpected significant differences were found between the groups. All biomarkers, except protein C, correlated with one another and after stratification of glycocalyx degradation only syndecan-1 levels ≥ median correlated with other biomarkers. The prevalence of TEs was 8.1 % after mean follow-up of 8.4 years. Overall, the hemostatic profile appeared normal, however, in a subset of patients, evidence of some endothelial activation/damage including glycocalyx degradation and fibrinolysis was found, identifying a potentially more thrombogenic group."

CD010438,0,4030709,0,The clinical effectiveness and safety of chronic plasmapheresis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.,"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic nonsuppurative, destructive cholangitis, whose etiology is unknown. Morbidity arises early from pruritus and later from hypercholesterolemia with xanthoma formation. Therapy is supportive and directed at the complications of cholestasis. Plasmapheresis has been reported to benefit patients with hyperlipidemia and PBC; thus a pilot study of plasmapheresis utilizing the Haemonetics Model 30 with replacement by albumin and saline was conducted. Five patients (four female and one male) with a mean age of 43 (range 29-58) and a mean duration of illness of 9.5 years (range 6-21) with marked jaundice, xanthomas, xanthelasma, hepatomegaly, fatigability, anorexia, and pruritus, as well as mild nausea were studied. Peripheral neuropathy was present in two patients. Two patients had splenomegaly. Two patients had an associated Sjogren syndrome. All patients had high serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and cholesterol levels and mild elevations in aspartate amino transferase and alanine amino transferase activities. Immune complexes measured in four patients were present. Antimitochondrial antibody titers were significant in all patients. Patients underwent a mean of 63 plasmapheresis procedures over a mean of 112 weeks removing a mean of 94.7 liters of plasma. No serious toxicity was seen. All patients showed a reduction in pruritus, xanthomas, xanthelasmas, and serum cholesterol values. The two patients who had evidence of Sjogren syndrome noted subjective improvement. All patients who had fatigue, anorexia and nausea also noted moderate improvement. There was no change in hepatomegaly or splenomegaly in patients demonstrating such organomegaly. Liver function did not change significantly. Overall, four patients had improvement in their condition and one patient achieved stability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010438,0,22234684,0,Solulin increases clot stability in whole blood from humans and dogs with hemophilia.,"Solulin is a soluble form of thrombomodulin that is resistant to proteolysis and oxidation. It has been shown to increase the clot lysis time in factor VIII (fVIII)-deficient plasma by an activated thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa)-dependent mechanism. In the present study, blood was drawn from humans and dogs with hemophilia, and thromboelastography was used to measure tissue factor-initiated fibrin formation and tissue-plasminogen activator-induced fibrinolysis. The kinetics of TAFI and protein C activation by the thrombin-Solulin complex were determined to describe the relative extent of anticoagulation and antifibrinolysis. In severe hemophilia A, clot stability increased by > 4-fold in the presence of Solulin while minimally affecting clot lysis time. Patients receiving fVIII/fIX prophylaxis showed a similar trend of increased clot stability in the presence of Solulin. The catalytic efficiencies of TAFI and protein C activation by the thrombin-Solulin complex were determined to be 1.53 and 0.02/μM/s, respectively, explaining its preference for antifibrinolysis over anticoagulation at low concentrations. Finally, hemophilic dogs given Solulin had improved clot strength in thromboelastography assays. In conclusion, the antifibrinolytic properties of Solulin are exhibited in hemophilic human (in vitro) and dog (in vivo/ex vivo) blood at low concentrations. Our findings suggest the therapeutic utility of Solulin at a range of very low doses."
CD010438,0,7269873,0,[Hormonal contraceptives of differentiated composition -- effects on thrombocyte function (author's transl)].,"The number, proliferation, and aggregation of thrombocytes, platelet adhesiveness, and thromboblastographic values were investigated in the context of 52 women, who were on a compound hormonal contraceptive with threefold-differentiated gestagen, and of ten women with a compound hormonal contraceptive of two-fold gestagen differentiation. Tests were conducted over six months. Significant deviations from normal values were recordable. No definite conclusions, however, can be drawn from such individual observations. Disorders in thrombocyte function and change in thromboblastographic values, when considered with all their implications, are likely to suggest the presence of effects from hormonal contraceptives. Yet, both type and concentrations of oestrogens and gestagens are of minor importance to such change. Nevertheless, somewhat higher risk of thrombo-embolism should be assumed, if other conductive factors are present, at the same time."
CD010438,0,10155358,0,Coagulation monitoring during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: the role of thrombelastography.,"Patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are at an increased risk for developing coagulopathies due to the adverse effects of extracorporeal circulation on the hemostatic mechanism. Methods of determining causative factors of bleeding diathesis are often inconsistent and non-specific. ECMO patients require aggressive transfusion therapy with autogenic blood products to stabilize and maintain hemostasis. The present study evaluated the coagulation status of newborn patients undergoing ECMO therapy, using a viscoelastic monitor (Thrombelastograph -TEG) that measures functional aspects of clot development and stabilization. Seventeen neonatal patients undergoing ECMO for severe respiratory dysfunction were entered into this study. Serial blood samples were obtained and routine coagulation assessment including fibrinogen concentration, platelet count and ionized calcium was performed. In addition, fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDP), d-Dimers, antithrombin III and plasma free hemoglobin were measured. Transfusion indicators were established and total transfusion requirements recorded. TEG profiles were determined with the use of heparinase, an enzyme that degrades heparin but has little effect on other coagulation factors. The most commonly encountered complication was hemorrhaging which was diagnosed by laboratory and clinical assessment in 11 of 17 patients. Transfusion requirements (measured in ml/kg/ECMO hour) were the following: packed red blood cells--1.34 +/- 0.5; platelets--0.71 +/- 0.57; fresh frozen plasma--0.09 +/- 0.12; cryoprecipitate 0.05 +/- 0.05. Thrombelastograph profiles reflected hemostatic conditions that ranged from severe coagulopathies (DIC) to hypercoagulability. Interpretation of TEG profiles identified hemostatic abnormalities in 57 of 101 profiles (46.5%), with the most common etiology related to platelet dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010438,0,20222835,0,Role of thrombelastograph haemostasis analyser in detection of hypercoagulability following surgery with and without use of intermittent pneumatic compression.,"The effect of using intermittent pneumatic compression on incidence of postoperative thromboembolic events was studied, and hypercoagulability following various kinds of surgery with or without use of intermittent pneumatic compression was evaluated with the use of a thrombelastograph. The study included 317 male patients undergoing various surgical procedures; 193 patients used intermittent pneumatic compression after surgery and 124 did not use intermittent pneumatic compression. Their ages ranged between 52 and 75 years. Thrombelastograph was used to detect hypercoagulability. Results showed that in patients using intermittent pneumatic compression, 67% of the hip surgery patients had hypercoagulability one to three days postoperatively, as did 34% having major thoracic or abdominal procedures and 18% in the remaining general surgery. Of 18 hip surgery patients who did not use intermittent pneumatic compression, 10 sustained thromboembolic complications following operation. Three deaths resulted from pulmonary embolism. For the remaining 106 patients who did not use intermittent pneumatic compression, seven patients manifested Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, and three deaths resulted from pulmonary embolism. There was no incident of thromboembolic complications for the 24 patients with hip surgery who used the intermittent pneumatic compression. There were no complications following various surgical procedures in the 169 patients who used intermittent pneumatic compression. It might be concluded that the thrombelastograph is useful to detect hypercoagulability postoperatively, and intermittent pneumatic compression is useful for thromboembolic prophylaxis."

We measured changes in whole-blood cytokine production in response to soluble egg antigen (SEA), soluble worm antigen (SWA), or Teg after treatment with praziquantel (PZQ) in a cohort of 187 individuals living near Lake Albert, Uganda. Levels of SWA-induced IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 increased after treatment with PZQ, and the greatest relative increases were seen in the responses to Teg. Mean levels of Teg-specific IL-5 and IL-10 increased ~10-15-fold, and mean levels of IL-13 increased ~5-fold. Correlations between the changes in cytokines suggested that their production was positively coregulated by tegumentally derived antigens. Levels of SEA-, SWA-, and Teg-induced interferon- gamma were not significantly changed by treatment, and, with the exception of IL-10, which increased slightly, responses to SEA also remained largely unchanged. The changes in cytokines were not strongly influenced by age or intensity of infection and were not accompanied by corresponding increases in the numbers of circulating eosinophils or lymphocytes."

The first batch of patients, taken as a control group, received parenteral nutrition with carbohydrates and proteins, whilst the second group received lipids in addition. Study of blood coagulation, carried out every three days, involved : thromboelastogen on whole blood and plasma, platelet count, platelet adhesiveness and the estimation of factors II, V, VII and X, fibrinogen, plasminogen and fibrinogen break-down products. In the patients not receiving lipids, the normal alterations seen during the postoperative period occurred : normalisation in plasminogen levels and in F.B.P., and an increase in the number of platelets and in fibrinogen level. The presence of lipids in the nutritional fluids resulted in changes in the same direction, but the increase in platelet count was slighter and fibrinogen level, after a slight increase, returned to initial values on the 20th day of parenteral nutrition. Fibrinogen was the only factor which showed any significant difference between the two groups."

First, haemoglobin-free, thrombelastography and platelet adhesion tests were performed in order to investigate the blood contact performance. Secondly, specimens were seeded with endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, and cell viability tests were carried out by MTT and SEM. Results show that neutralized acid-soluble type I collagen films do not enhance blood coagulation, do not alter normal viscoelastic properties of blood and slightly activate platelet adhesion and aggregation.

We studied 21 patients, each with International Society for Haemostasis and Thrombosis scores of 5 or more (compatible with overt DIC) and less than 5 (suggestive of nonovert DIC), who underwent whole blood nonadditive TEM. A TEM score based on the reaction and kappa times, alpha angle, and maximum amplitude was defined as the total number of TEM parameters deranged in the direction of hypocoagulability. The TEM score at a cutoff of 2 or more achieved sensitivity of 95.2%, specificity of 81.0%, and the highest receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of all parameters of 0.957 for identifying overt DIC. Individual TEM parameters correlated variably with conventional tests. Their combination into a cohesive TEM score possibly better captured the multiple hemostatic derangements occurring in DIC. The TEM score may bring objectivity to the analysis of TEM data."

This study proposed to kinetically define fibrinolytic vulnerability and the contribution of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor to fibrinolytic defenses in normal subjects. Plasma from 30 normal subjects was exposed to tissue factor/kaolin and tissue-type plasminogen activator (100 IU/ml). Prior to activation of coagulation, samples were either not exposed or exposed to potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (25 microg/ml, a thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor). Data were collected until clot lysis time was observed. In plasma, time to onset of maximum rate of fibrinolysis was 200-1125 s (95% confidence interval), maximum rate of lysis was -2.0--0.8 dynes/cm2 per s, and clot lysis time was 555-1595 s. Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor's inhibition decreased the time to onset of maximum fibrinolysis by 45%, increased the rate of maximum lysis by 50%, and decreased clot lysis time by 45%. The study established a range of fibrinolytic kinetic values and the contribution of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in normal subjects. Study of disease states involving potential hypofibrinolysis (e.g., in-situ ventricular assist device, cancer) could be conducted using this system to link fibrinolytic vulnerability and thrombophilia."

This multicentre, open-label trial aimed to explore the dose-response relationship between recombinant activated factor VII concentration and thromboelastography parameters in blood samples from patients with haemophilia A or B with inhibitors in a nonbleeding state. Citrated whole blood samples from 16 patients (>or=16 years) with haemophilia A or B were spiked ex vivo with recombinant activated factor VII (1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 2.6, 3.0, 3.5 microg/ml), corresponding approximately to doses of 90-270 microg/kg. Samples were analysed by Thromboelastograph or Rotation Thromboelastography (three United States and three European centres, respectively) within 30 min (final lipidated recombinant tissue factor 1: 17 000; final CaCl2 15 mM). Thromboelastograph/Rotation Thromboelastography parameters showed large intersubject variation in the baseline profiles. There was a clear effect when recombinant activated factor VII was added; however, a clear concentration-response relationship was only detected for one patient. This is likely due to the fact that the curves were not sufficiently abnormal that led to reduced assay sensitivity. Our preliminary results suggest that thromboelastography may potentially be a clinically useful tool for monitoring changing concentrations of recombinant activated factor VII in haemophilia patients, but only when the baseline curve is significantly abnormal. Thus, test conditions may need to be optimized before Thromboelastograph/Rotation Thromboelastography can be utilized for all inhibitor patients."

We have demonstrated that platelet-fibrin clot characteristics can be used to stratify patients for risk of ischemic events following percutaneous coronary intervention. We investigated race and sex differences in thrombogenicty and the relation to ischemic risk in 252 consecutive African-American and Caucasian men and women undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention. Platelet-fibrin clot characteristics were measured using the Thrombelastograph Hemostasis System. The incidence of adverse ischemic events was assessed over a 6-month follow-up period. Overall, 40 ischemic events (15.9%) occurred. Adverse events were higher in African-Americans than Caucasians (P = 0.14), and in women than men (P = 0.004). The incidence was highest in African-American women (37.5%) and lowest in African-American men (6.5%). Measured Thrombelastograph parameters were significantly different between ischemic and nonischemic patients (P < 0.05). African-American women in the ischemic group exhibited higher thrombogenicity than the other race and sex groups (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression identified platelet-fibrin mediated clot strength (relative risk 2.52, P = 0.017) and sex (relative risk 2.56, P = 0.009) as significant independent predictors of ischemic events 6 months postpercutaneous coronary intervention. Thrombogenicity is a novel measurable cardiovascular risk factor that varies by race and sex, is highest in African-American women, and independently predicts the frequency of ischemic events following percutaneous coronary intervention. Point-of-service measurements of platelet-fibrin clot characteristics may lead to more intensified antithrombotic therapy and reduced mortality in selected patients."

The characteristic changes of the thrombelastographic indices r, k and mA are described. During operation r and k shortened, but no change in mA was observed. This response was in part associated with an increase in factor VIII activity. Following operation, while r time was somewhat shortened, much more marked changes in k and mA were evident. Increasing fibrinogen concentration was the dominant factor in determining the post-operative changes in the thrombelastograph."

CD010438,0,22049808,0,Massive transfusion.,"Massive Transfusion is a part of Damage Control Resuscitation. The aim of transfusion therapy is to restore oxygen delivery to poorly perfused tissues and to treat the acute coagulopathy of trauma. The severity and complexity of modern injuries have led to the use of swift, protocol-driven care with the use of'Shock Packs' and management of metabolic complications. The proactive treatment of the coagulopathy has been termed Haemostatic Resuscitation. The delivery of this transfusion capability has required an increasingly sophisticated logistic and laboratory response. New operational capabilities have included cold chain solutions; laboratory management information systems; platelet apheresis and ROTEM. This investment in the massive transfusion capability has delivered rapid resuscitation. It has also enabled clinicians to direct individualised transfusion support following initial resuscitation i.e. goal directed therapy. Future technical solutions should further support the prehospital delivery of transfusion while addressing the logistic tail. However, the key to success is the knowledge and skills of frontline staff to deliver safe and appropriate blood transfusion."

CD010438,0,17117062,0,Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for management of anticoagulation in infants on excor ventricular assist device.,"Anticoagulation in infants and children on a ventricular assist device presents particular challenges. Unfractionated heparin has poor bioavailability; it can be difficult to achieve a stable anticoagulant effect; and, in the long-term, there is a risk of osteopenia. Long-term warfarin can be difficult to manage in infants on formula milk with vitamin K supplementation. We review our recent experience with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin. Two patients received a left ventricular assist device (Excor, Berlin Heart AG) as a bridge to transplantation. Initial anticoagulation consisted of unfractionated heparin infusion beginning 6 hours after implantation to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time of 70 seconds, checked every 4 to 6 hours. Platelet count (aim >80,000/microl) and thromboelastography were assessed daily. Antithrombin required substitution to maintain levels >70 IU/dl. To optimize anticoagulation, both infants were switched to subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin twice daily aiming for an anti-Xa activity between 0.5 and 1.0 IU/ml. Aspirin was added on day 4, checking platelet aggregation every 2 to 4 days, aiming at arachidonic acid stimulated aggregation 10% to 30% of baseline, collagen 100% of baseline. Dipyridamole was added once stability was reached if platelets count exceeded 150,000/microl. There were no clinical thromboembolic or bleeding events. Both patients had successful transplantation."

The Cell-Save Haemonetics* system was used systematically in 167 consecutive patients (Group I). This group of autotransfused patients was analysed prospectively and compared with a control group (Group II) of 116 patients operated one year before and analysed retrospectively. During the whole hospitalisation, homologous blood products were required in 40.7% of patients in Group I compared with 73.3% of patients in Group II (p less than 0.0001). The average requirements of packed cells per patient were 2.7 +/- 1.3 in Group I compared with 4.1 +/- 2.5 in Group II (p less than 0.0001).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of spinal and general anesthesia on blood coagulability in normal pregnant women undergoing cesarean section, using thromboelastography. In the spinal anesthesia group (n = 15), thromboelastography was performed after crystalloid preloading and during the immediate postanesthesia course. In the general anesthesia group (n = 15), thromboelastography was performed before induction and during the immediate postanesthesia course. Values for all thromboelastographic variables (reaction time [r], clot formation time [K], coagulation time [rK], maximum amplitude [MA], elastic shear modulus [G], clot formation rate [alpha angle], and coagulation index [CI]) in the preanesthesia period were similar in both the spinal and general anesthesia groups. However, in the postanesthesia period, r and K significantly decreased (P < 0.05), and alpha angle (P < 0.05) and CI significantly increased (P < 0.01) in the general anesthesia group when compared with the spinal anesthesia group. In the postanesthesia period, MA and G were similar in both groups. In the spinal anesthesia group, thromboelastographic variables did not change significantly in the postanesthesia compared with the preanesthesia period. We conclude that the use of general anesthesia for cesarean section is associated with accelerated coagulability when compared with spinal anesthesia."

The results showed that VIIIR = Ag, PAdT, PagT, HPF, and whole blood and plasma viscosity were elevated, fibrinogen elevated in the active stage, AT-III declined, RBC electrophoresis time prolonged, and changes suggesting hypercoagulation in thromboelastogram. All these indicated the existence of a hypercoagulation state in TAO patients, which could contribute to the process of thrombosis. The relationship between immune reactions and blood hypercoagulability could be crucial in the pathogenesis of TAO.

CD010438,0,19665684,0,"Global hemostasis testing thromboelastography: old technology, new applications.","Thromboelastography (TEG) as a method of assessing global hemostatic and fibrinolytic function has existed for more than 60 years. Improvements in TEG technology have led to increased reliability and thus increased usage. The TEG has been used primarily in the settings of liver transplant and cardiac surgery, with proven utility for monitoring hemostatic and fibrinolytic derangements. In recent years, indications for TEG testing have expanded to include managing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, assessing bleeding of unclear etiology, and assessing hypercoagulable states. In addition, TEG platelet mapping has been utilized to monitor antiplatelet therapy. Correlation between TEG platelet mapping and other platelet function tests such as the PFA-100 or platelet aggregation studies, however, has not been evaluated fully for clinical outcomes, and results may not be comparable. In general, the advantages of the TEG include evaluation of global hemostatic function using whole blood, a quick turn-around-time, the possibility of both point-of-care-testing and performance in central laboratories, the ability to detect hyperfibrinolysis, monitoring therapy with recombinant activated factor VII, and detection of low factor XIII activity. Potential applications include polycythemia and dysfibrinogenemia. Disadvantages of TEG include a relatively high coefficient of variation, poorly standardized methodologies, and limitations on specimen stability of native whole blood samples. In the pediatric setting, an additional advantage of the TEG is a relatively small sample volume, but a disadvantage is the difference in normal ranges between infants, especially newborns, and adults. In summary, TEG is an old concept with new applications that may provide a unique perspective on global hemostasis in various clinical settings."
CD010438,0,17127479,0,Thrombelastography: current clinical applications and its potential role in interventional cardiology.,"Thrombelastography is a bedside blood test used to assess patients' haemostatic status. It has a well-established role in hepatobiliary and cardiac surgery and is also used in obstetrics and trauma medicine to assess coagulation and identify the causes of post-operative bleeding. It is not routinely used in the diagnosis or treatment of thrombosis although recently it has been shown to predict thrombotic events post-operatively and after percutaneous intervention (PCI). In cardiovascular medicine the importance of the platelet in the pathophysiology of vascular events is increasingly apparent. As a result antiplatelet therapy is a cornerstone of the treatment for coronary disease, particularly in the setting of acute coronary syndromes. The increasing utilization of stents, particularly drug-eluting devices, in PCI has also necessitated widespread use of antiplatelet agents to minimize the risk of stent thrombosis. A quick, accurate and reliable test to measure the effect of platelet inhibition by antiplatelet agents on clotting in an individual patient would be of profound clinical value. The results from such a test could provide prognostic information, allow treatment with antiplatelet agents to be tailored to the individual and identify resistance to one or more of these agents. Optimization and tailoring of anti-platelet therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly those undergoing PCI, using such a test may reduce morbidity and mortality from thrombotic and haemorrhagic complications. Current methods of assessing platelet activity measure platelet count and function in isolation. Optical aggregation is the most widely used method for assessing platelet function but it is relatively time consuming, measures platelet function in isolation rather than in the context of clot formation and is not a bedside test. By contrast the modified thrombelastograph platelet mapping kit marketed by Haemoscope can be used to assess the effects of antiplatelet agents on ex vivo blood clotting, thus giving a measurement more relevant to in vivo responses. This represents a potentially powerful tool to assess response of individual patients to antiplatelet therapy, particularly in the context of PCI."

A total of 18 colorectal cancer patients who received bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy were included. There was no statistically significant difference between results of platelet count, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, and D-Dimer obtained at baseline and on day 1 of chemotherapy cycles 4, 8, and 12. CFT value was significantly increased on day 1 of cycle 12 compared with baseline value by both INTEM and EXTEM assays while CT and MCF showed no significant difference. Correlation analysis revealed significant correlation between laboratory parameters and ROTEM(®) parameters. Platelet count showed a positive correlation with MCF in INTEM (r = 0.627) and EXTEM (r = 0.699) assays while showed a negative correlation with CFT in EXTEM (r = -603). There was a significant negative correlation between fibrinogen levels and CFT in INTEM (r = -0.617) and EXTEM (r = -0.512).

A causal association between elevated FVIII levels and venous thrombosis incidence has been established; no such association has been confirmed with arterial thrombosis. The independent role of elevated FVIII levels in arteriolar thrombosis was evaluated in a mouse model to determine the thrombogenic potential of elevated levels of FVIII. The in vitro thrombogenic effect of elevated FVIII levels was examined using thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex generation and thromboelastography (TEG) assays. The thrombogenic potential of acute and extended elevation of circulating FVIII levels was assessed using ferric chloride induced injury of the cremaster arterioles. The rate of TAT complex formation, and the final concentration of TAT complexes, significantly increased as FVIII levels were elevated from 100% to 400% FVIII activity. TEG analysis of fibrin and clot formation showed that as FVIII levels were elevated, the time to initial fibrin formation decreased and the rate of fibrin formation increased. The acute elevation of circulating FVIII to 400% FVIII activity resulted in significantly decreased times to vessel occlusion. Prolonged elevation of FVIII activity did not significantly affect time to vessel occlusion. In conclusion, acute elevations in FVIII levels result in a non-linear thrombogenic effect, with non-significant increases in thrombogenic risk within the physiological range (FVIII levels up to 200%). Prolonged elevation of plasma FVIII did not further increase the thrombogenic potential of elevated FVIII levels."

The authors found the previously unknown parallels of the impairments of microcirculation, the severity of traumatic injury, and the parameters of central hemodynamics, and oxygen status in the patient. Traumatic shock was characterized by spastic impairments of all the components (perivascular, vascular, and intravascular) of microcirculation progressing to spastic-and-atonic ones. The degree of microcirculatory disorders depended on the severity of shock and the nature of injury. The criteria for compensation and decompensation in the microcirculatory module were defined. The routine infusion therapy initiated in the compensation period promotes to a significant alleviation of microcirculatory disorders; however, the mentioned shifts long persist.

CD010438,0,2822317,0,Treatment of acute myocardial infarction with subcutaneous heparin at low doses.,"Heparin has been used intensively in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction and preinfarction angina (PA) at full doses as a single drug by us. However, heparin may be used at smaller doses for similar purposes. These doses are not exactly anticoagulant, even though they reduce blood hypercoagulability, and act mainly in an antithrombotic capacity. We studied 529 patients with acute myocardial infarction, of whom 262 were treated with subcutaneous heparin at low doses (5000 IU every 12 h) and 267 received conventional therapy without antithrombotic drugs. Heparin used was Heparina (Abbott) and Liquemine (Roche), in vials with the equivalence 1 cm3 = 50 mg = 5000 IU. Blood rheologic factors (thromboelastography, platelet adhesiveness, total blood viscosity, and number of platelets) were determined in all patients, those treated with heparin at low doses and also the control group, before and after the 30-day treatment period. Diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, laboratory studies, and electrocardiogram examination. In both the 262 patients treated with heparin at low doses and in the control group of 267 patients, baseline values of rheological factors were high. After 30 days (i.e., after study completion) these high values which are statistically significant compared with normal values, with p less than 0.0001 for both groups, remained constant in the control group who did not receive heparin. On the contrary, in the group treated with heparin at low doses, all these factors changed. Heparin provides protection against thrombosis by increasing the negative charge of the vessel wall and by other reactions at the endothelial surface. Heparin requires a plasmatic component called antithrombine III.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A marked improvement was observed on the values of r (reaction time), k (clot formation time) and ma (maximal amplitude) of thrombelastograms (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.001). The prothrombin time was reduced after the surgery, but not significantly (p less than 0.1, greater than 0.05). The levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin remained almost unchanged, while serum fibrinogen-fibrin degradation products (FDP) showed a slight decrease postoperatively. The immunohistologic study of the spleen excised from 7 cases with liver cirrhosis, with the use of the direct immunofluorescence technique, demonstrated the deposits of fibrin in the splenic cords in all cases. It was not recognized in the spleens of 4 cases without cirrhosis used as the control. A further study of the spleen weight and plasma fibrinogen level showed that a significant inverse correlation exists between these two parameters (p less than 0.01).

Correlation of factor XIII antigen levels with pulmonary occlusion rate, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and clot firmness.","In patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), pulmonary occlusion rate is directly related to D-dimer and inversely related to fibrinogen levels. The role of coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) levels in acute venous thromboembolism is not known. A total of 120 consecutive patients with suspected PE and VIDAS D-dimer levels >500 micro g/L were investigated by helical computed tomography (CT). Pulmonary occlusion rate was assessed by CT using the modified Miller index. D-dimer, fibrinogen, and FXIII A- and B-subunit antigen levels were taken on admission. Thrombelastography (TEG) was performed in a subset of patients (n = 12). The 71 patients with PE had lower FXIII A-subunit levels than the 49 patients with excluded PE (78.6 +/- 24.5% vs. 91.3+/-28.8%, p=0.01). In both groups, FXIII A-subunit was inversely related to D-dimer levels. FXIII A-subunit correlated with fibrinogen levels in patients with PE but not in patients without PE. FXIII A-subunit decreased with increasing pulmonary occlusion rate. The risk of PE was increased in the presence of A-subunit levels < 60% (OR 7.0 [95% CI 1.4-35.3], p = 0.019). Clot firmness determined by TEG was lower in patients with PE than in patients without PE. In patients with PE, circulating FXIII A-subunit is decreased compared to patients with suspected but excluded PE. The higher the clot burden within the pulmonary arteries the lower the FXIII antigen. In these patients, direct relation of FXIII A-subunit to fibrinogen levels argues for significant consumption of these coagulation factors in PE. This consumption of FXIII can also be detected by a global coagulation test like TEG."

For the filtration systems, the average whole blood rate was 50 ml/min and the plasma separation rate was about 21 ml/min for a transmembrane pressure about 70 mmHg. The pre/post percent reduction and sieving coefficient were calculated for some plasma and blood components. A variety of laboratory studies was monitored to assess the efficacy of plasma separators, their biocompatibility and some yields. These results show that the 2 filters appear safe and efficacious but their modules are too simple and do not offer a great security (no transmembrane pressure control or no extracorporeal fluid balance). For a blood banker, IBM 2997 seems more interesting if we take in account its characteristics during plasma exchanges and the possibility which is offered to carry out cytapheresis procedures. But for a thrombopenic patient the filtration systems keep their advantages."

In the first group, haemodilution was performed with a physiological balanced salt solution similar to plasma, with the exception of calcium, and buffered to a normal pH (Plasmalyte B) at 37 degrees C on blood obtained from consenting volunteers. In the second group, a protein-poor body fluid (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) obtained from parturient patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean section was used as the diluent. There were statistically significant differences between the warmed Plasmalyte B treated samples and their untreated controls for all variables measured by the thrombelastograph, except for maximum amplitude, and between the CSF treated samples and their untreated controls for all variables. We conclude that electrolyte and acid-base composition of the diluent fluid had no effect on the observation that crystalloid haemodilution produces hypercoagulability. The marked increase in coagulability produced by addition of CSF cannot be explained on a simple haemodilution basis and confirms previous suggestions of the presence of a procoagulant factor in CSF."

We hypothesized that residual anaesthetic in the epidural space could decrease efficacy of an epidural blood patch in preventing postdural puncture headache. Levobupivacaine has recently been approved for epidural anaesthesia. Its effects on coagulation have not previously been studied. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of levobupivacaine on clotting using thromboelastography. Ten ASA Class I volunteers were studied. Venous blood samples were analysed using a Haemoscope 2000D TEG analyser. Whole blood, a 50% saline control and two levobupivacaine solutions (2.5 mg mL(-1) and 2.5 microg mL(-1) in blood) were compared. The former reproduces that produced in the epidural space by blood (20 mL for an epidural blood patch) and levobupivacaine 0.5% (20 mL). The latter approximates plasma concentrations following epidural injection of levobupivacaine 0.5% (20 mL). P < 0.05 was considered significant. Maximum amplitude (MA), a measure of clot strength, is decreased by levobupivacaine 2.5 mg mL(-1). Levobupivacaine 2.5 mg mL(-1) decreases clot strength and may reduce efficacy of a prophylactic epidural blood patch."

We present the discovery of sulfated pentagalloylglucoside (6) as a highly selective inhibitor of human FXIa. Biochemical screening of a focused library led to the identification of 6, a sulfated aromatic mimetic of heparin. Inhibitor 6 displayed a potency of 551 nM against FXIa, which was at least 200-fold more selective than other relevant enzymes. It also prevented activation of factor IX and prolonged human plasma and whole blood clotting. Inhibitor 6 reduced V(MAX) of FXIa hydrolysis of chromogenic substrate without affecting the K(M), suggesting an allosteric mechanism. Competitive studies showed that 6 bound in the heparin-binding site of FXIa. No allosteric small molecule has been discovered to date that exhibits equivalent potency against FXIa. Inhibitor 6 is expected to open up a major route to allosteric FXIa anticoagulants with clinical relevance."

CD010438,0,8012494,0,A comparative study of plateletpheresis using Baxter Autopheresis C and Haemonetics PCS plus.,This study compared plateletpheresis on the Haemonetics PCS Plus (PCS Plus) and the Baxter Autopheresis C (Auto C) using the same 100 selected donors. The number of packs meeting UK BTS/NIBSC specification (> 2.2 x 10(11) platelets per pack) was achieved by 99% of PCS Plus and 82% of Auto C procedures. The positive correlation found between donor precount and final platelet yield was better for the PCS Plus. Both machines met U.K. specification for white-cell contamination but this was significantly greater for the Auto C. Plasma yields were similar. As a result of this study we chose to use the PCS Plus for routine plateletpheresis in our unit. This has enabled us not only to comply with UK BTS/NIBSC specifications for apheresis platelets easily and cost effectively but also to meet our own higher specification (2.75 x 10(11) platelets per pack) using existing staff and without extending the working day.

We selected the right atrium as the site for collection and transfusion back of the blood for the harvest of PRP. We studied changes of the hemodynamics and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2 during the intraoperative harvest of autologous PRP in two patients who were undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. The whole blood was collected, processed and the red blood cells were transfused immediately back to the patients using the Plasma Collection System (Haemonetics Model 50). The procedure was accomplished prior to starting CPB. The PRP product was transfused back into the patients at the completion of CPB. The arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and SvO2 decreased during the collecting phase and immediately returned to the baseline values during the returning phase. No change was observed in the heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation. We conclude that the usage of right atrium as the site for collection and transfusion back of the blood to harvest PRP is effective and useful, and the continuous monitoring of SvO2 is mandatory for detecting the decline of the cardiac output."

We investigated in this observational trial whether the reproducibility of this point-of-care testing was influenced by performance at the bedside or in the hospital laboratory. In addition, difference in time of performance between both measurements was compared. Perioperative blood samples obtained during major pediatric surgery were run in duplicate on two different ROTEM® devices located in the OR and in the hospital laboratory. The Bland-Altman test was used to compare differences of both measurements. ROTEM® measurements of 90 blood samples obtained from 24 children showed no overall clinically meaningful differences, whether they were performed bedside or in the hospital laboratory. Minor differences were found for the InTEM clot formation time (CFT) showing a mean bias of 10.79 seconds. Time saving was 11 minutes (8-16 minutes) if ROTEM® measurements were performed bedside (p < 0.001). In conclusion, there were minimal effects on ROTEM® measurements irrespective of whether they were performed in the hospital laboratory or at the bedside by a single trained staff member, while the latter saved valuable time."

CD010438,0,15981443,0,von Willebrand disease: a laboratory approach.,"von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common inherited bleeding disorder. Accurate diagnosis and classification of VWD is crucial for clinical management. A detailed clinical history, including that of bleeding, is required. A family and drug history are also important. Genetic factors such as blood group, and environmental factors such as stress, trauma, pregnancy and inflammation should also be considered. The age, ethnic group and hormonal status could also affect the von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels. No single test is robust enough to detect all variants of VWD. In view of the heterogeneity of the disease and limitations in assays, a battery of tests should be performed before a final diagnosis can be reached. These include the screening coagulation tests, factor VIII:C assay, VWF antigen assay, assessment of functional VWF which includes VWF ristocetin cofactor assays, VWF collagen binding assay, ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation and VWF multimer analysis. The newer ELISA techniques based on VWF binding with factor VIII glycoprotein (Gp) 1b and cerebrosides have also helped in determining certain unusual forms of VWD. The advent of new systems such as platelet function analysers (PFA), thromboelastography (TEG) and clot signature analysers (CSA), which are designed to assess either the primary platelet function or as a global haemostasis screen, have facilitated and simplified the diagnosis. However, few centres all over the world can perform all these expensive tests to provide a final diagnosis of VWD. We reviewed the laboratory investigations required for a diagnosis of VWD. Apart from congenital VWD, the possibility of acquired VWD should be considered in those with a negative past history of bleeding or in the presence of an underlying disease."

There was a mild procoagulant effect up to a dilution of 11% and an anticoagulant effect above this level, which rapidly increased so that coagulation was grossly deranged at a 15% dilution. Although the clinical significance of these findings is not yet known, it may suggest that for hypertonic saline dextran there is little to separate the top of the therapeutic window from the threshold of potentially serious adverse effects."

CD010438,0,7572010,0,Effects of organic nitrate vasodilators on platelet function before and after cardiopulmonary bypass.,"Various in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo tests have shown that organic nitrates attenuate platelet function. Because organic nitrates are commonly administered to patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the postoperative bleeding tendency observed in these patients might be strengthened by nitrates. Therefore, we compared the acute effects of nitroglycerin (0.5 micrograms kg-1 min-1) and isosorbide dinitrate (0.5 or 2.5 micrograms kg-1 min-1) with those of placebo on platelet function both before and after cardiopulmonary bypass in 40 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Bleeding time, platelet retention on glass beads, i.e. platelet adhesiveness, and thromboelastograph tracings were used as indicators of platelet function. Although nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate induced significant haemodynamic changes, e.g. decreases in arterial and pulmonary arterial pressure, they had no significant effects on the indices of platelet function. We conclude that, when given in haemodynamically effective doses, neither nitroglycerin nor isosorbide dinitrate have any measurable acute effect on platelet function as evaluated with on-site tests in patients undergoing CABG surgery."
CD010438,0,20683324,0,The antifibrinolytic effects of carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2 are fibrin and alpha2-antiplasmin dependent.,"Carbon monoxide derived from a carbon monoxide-releasing molecule [tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer; CORM-2] has been recently demonstrated to diminish tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)-mediated fibrinolysis of plasma thrombi via enhancement of alpha2-antiplasmin-plasmin interactions. The goal of this study was to confirm this mechanism by comparing tPA-mediated fibrinolysis with fibrin-independent, alpha2-antiplasmin-resistant streptokinase-mediated fibrinolysis in CORM-2 exposed plasma. Normal plasma was exposed to 0 or 100 micromol/l CORM-2, with coagulation activated with tissue factor and fibrinolysis initiated with 100 U/ml tPA or 50 U/ml streptokinase. Thrombus growth/disintegration kinetics were monitored with thrombelastography until clot lysis time occurred. Unlike tPA-lysed clots, streptokinase-exposed thrombi demonstrated no significant CORM-2-mediated prolongation of clot growth time or clot lysis time. In contrast, streptokinase-mediated lysis did not significantly change the CORM-2-mediated percentage increase in the maximum rate of clot growth or maximum rate of clot lysis compared with tPA-exposed thrombi. CORM-2 likely attenuates fibrinolysis by a fibrin-dependent/alpha2-antiplasmin-dependent mechanism. Additional molecular investigation (e.g., mass spectroscopy) is planned to further elucidate how CORM-2 modifies fibrinogen/fibrin."
CD010438,0,22562643,0,Thromboelastometry during intraoperative transfusion of fresh frozen plasma in pediatric neurosurgery.,"Normal blood coagulation is essential in pediatric neurosurgery because of the risk of abundant bleeding, and therefore it is important to avoid transfusion of fluids that might interfere negatively with the coagulation process. There is a lack of transfusion guidelines in massive bleeding with pediatric neurosurgical patients, and early use of blood compounds is partly controversial. We describe two pediatric patients for whom fresh frozen plasma (FFP) infusion was started at the early phase of brain tumor surgery to prevent intraoperative coagulopathy and hypovolemia. In addition to the traditional laboratory testing, modified thromboelastometry analyses were used to detect possible disturbances in coagulation. Early transfusion of FFP and red blood cells preserved the whole blood coagulation capacity. Even with continuous FFP infusion, fibrin clot firmness was near to critical value at the end of surgery despite increased preoperative values. By using FFP instead of large amounts of crystalloids and colloids when major blood loss is expected, blood coagulation is probably less likely to be impaired. Our results indicate, however, that the capacity of FFP to correct fibrinogen deficit is limited."
CD010438,0,20024495,0,Impaired thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation in patients with dilutional coagulopathy during major surgery.,"Patients subjected to haemodilution during surgery are at increased risk of bleeding. We hypothesised that, in the acquired dilutional coagulopathy, insufficient haemostasis is due to either insufficient thrombin generation or insufficient fibrin clot formation. In tissue factor-activated plasmas from patients with coagulation deficiency, we measured time curves of thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation (thromboelastography). Investigated were in study A: 10 patients treated with vitamin K antagonist and five healthy subjects; in study B: 30 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery and infused with on average 2,000 ml crystalloids and colloids (no major bleeding); in study C: 58 patients undergoing major general surgery, and transfused with >5,000 ml crystalloids, colloids and red cell concentrates, who experienced major bleeding and were post-transfused with fresh frozen plasma. The treatment with vitamin K antagonist led to a progressive reduction in thrombin generation but not fibrin clot formation. In CPB patients, plasma factor levels post-surgery were 53-60% of normal. This was accompanied by moderate reduction in both haemostatic processes. In plasmas from patients undergoing major surgery, factor levels were 38-41% of normal, and these levels increased after plasma transfusion. Taking preset thresholds for normal thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation, at least one of these processes was low in 88-93% of the patients with (persistent) bleeding, but only in 40-53% of the patients without bleeding. In conclusion, the ability of thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation is independently reduced in acquired dilutional coagulopathy, while minimal levels of both are required for adequate haemostasis."

Further lymphocyte enrichment was achieved using a one-step sedimentation in the presence of hydroxyethyl starch, which produced suspensions of more than 90% lymphocytes. This degree of lymphocyte purity was important since phagocytes were inhibitory to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate/calcium ionophore (TPA/A23187)-induced IL-2 production when their concentration exceeded 15% of the total cells. Cell culture was performed in stirred fermenters. Using TPA/A23187 induction, up to 500 micrograms of IL-2 per liter were produced. The IL-2 was purified by absorption from the supernatants onto controlled pore glass and elution with 50% ethylene glycol, followed by Fractogel chromatography, and then preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an RP-6 column and elution with a gradient of n-propanol.

A multi-centre, randomised trial.","Thromboelastography methods have been used to predict or monitor treatment of haemophilia patients with recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa). However, neither of the two thromboelastographic methods (ROTEM and TEG) has as yet been validated. This multi-centre, randomised trial compared both methods in terms of intra- and inter- patient variability following in vivo and ex vivo rFVIIa administration to haemophilia A and B patients with and without inhibitors. Patients ((3)16 years old) received the same intravenous rFVIIa dose (45, 90 or 180 microg/kg) twice, 1-12 weeks apart. Blood samples were collected pre-dose and 15, 60, 120 and 240 minutes post-dose for ROTEM and TEG analysis. Pre-dose samples were also spiked ex vivo with rFVIIa (0.6, 1.2 or 2.4 microg/ml), to correspond to the three in vivo doses. Twenty-six haemophilia A and four haemophilia B patients were enrolled. A significant treatment effect was observed with in vivo rFVIIa (p<0.05) with more pronounced effects in inhibitor (n=14) versus non-inhibitor (n=16) patients. There was a strong positive correlation between ROTEM and TEG parameters. Intra- and inter-patient variation was large for all thromboelastography parameters at all time points and rFVIIa doses. Intra-patient variation was generally lower for non-inhibitor than inhibitor patients, and lower following ex vivo spiking versus in vivo rFVIIa administration. In conclusion, there was a clear effect of rFVIIa on all thromboelastography parameters, but the large intra- and inter-patient variability following in vivo rFVIIa administration renders the use of our method unsuitable for dose-response prediction for haemophilia patients in the clinical setting."

In the low molecular weight plasma expanders (6% Hespander and 3% dextran-40), in general, the coagulability decreased when the concentration was increased. In the high molecular weight plasma expanders (6 HES and 6% dextran-70), the coagulability increased slightly at low and high concentrations and the coagulability was reduced. As a conclusion, at clinically used concentrations of less than 20% in blood, changes in the TEG of the plasma expanders are minimum and have no clinical significance."

CD010438,0,1545559,0,Bacteriologic and endotoxin analysis of salvaged blood used in autologous transfusions during cardiac operations.,"Autologous blood transfusion is a common method of reducing the need for heterologous blood transfusion during cardiac operations. Recently we investigated an outbreak of severe, nonsurgical postoperative bleeding among patients undergoing heart operations and receiving intraoperative transfusion of blood from a cell conservation device (Cell Saver System, Haemonetics Corp., Braintree, Mass.). As a result of this investigation, we conducted a prospective study to determine if bacterial or endotoxin contamination of the blood collected in the Cell Saver System and used for reinfusion during heart operations contributes to postoperative bleeding complications. Patients' blood samples were collected immediately before operation, at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, 1 hour postoperatively, and from the Cell Saver System. All blood samples were cultured for bacteria, and all plasma samples were assayed for endotoxin. Preoperatively all patients having heart operations were without signs of infection, 33 of 37 blood cultures taken were negative, and none of the plasma samples had detectable endotoxin. After discontinuance of cardiopulmonary bypass but before delivery of blood from the Cell Saver System, bacteria and endotoxin were detected in 11 of 36 (30.6%) and five of 35 (14.3%) of the patients' blood samples, respectively. The blood aspirated from the open chest and collected by the Cell Saver System was culture positive in 30 of 31 (96.8%) samples, and seven of 29 (24.1%) contained endotoxin. One of 28 blood samples collected 1 hour postoperatively was culture positive, and five of 25 samples contained endotoxin. Of 61 total microorganisms isolated, 50 (82%) were coagulase-negative staphylococci, four (6.6%) aerobic diphtheroids, five (8.2%) anaerobic ""diphtheroids"" (Propionibacterium acnes), and two (3.2%) gram-negative bacilli. Plasma endotoxin concentrations ranged from 10 to 765 pg/ml. No signs of endotoxemia or unusual bleeding were observed intraoperatively or postoperatively in any of the 38 patients. Although blood collected in the Cell Saver System and used for reinfusion during heart operations often was contaminated with gram-positive bacterial commensals of the skin and low concentrations of endotoxin, no adverse effects were noted in the patients."

No simple single test will ever cover all aspects of platelet function. Some tests focus on the aggregation of platelets, for example aggregometry, other on the swelling in response to hypotonic solutions, i.e. the well-known hypotonic shock response, or adhesion or coagulation and clot retraction, for example thromboelastography. In general there is a lack of clinical studies showing a predictive value of analysis of platelet concentrates."
CD010438,0,22950390,0,"A comparison of intra-operative blood loss and acid-base balance between vasopressor and inotrope strategy during living donor liver transplantation: a randomised, controlled study.","Administration of vasopressors or inotropes during liver transplant surgery is almost universal, as this procedure is often accompanied by massive haemorrhage, acid-base imbalance, and cardiovascular instability. However, the actual agents that should be used and the choice between a vasopressor and an inotrope strategy are not clear from existing published evidence. In this prospective, randomised, controlled and single-blinded study, we compared the effects of a vasopressor strategy on intra-operative blood loss and acid-base status with those of an inotrope strategy during living donor liver transplantation. Seventy-six adult liver recipients with decompensated cirrhosis were randomly assigned to receive a continuous infusion of either phenylephrine at a dose of 0.3-0.4 μg.kg(-1).min(-1) or dopamine and/or dobutamine at 2-8 μg.kg(-1).min(-1) during surgery. Vascular resistance was higher over time in the phenylephrine group than in the dopamine/dobutamine group. Estimated blood loss was significantly lower in the phenylephrine group than in the dopamine/dobutamine group (mean (SD) 4.5 (1.8) l vs 6.1 (3.4) l, respectively, p=0.011). Patients in the phenylephrine group had lower lactate levels in the late pre-anhepatic and the early anhepatic phase and needed less bicarbonate administration than those in the dopamine/dobutamine group (median (IQR [range]) 40 (0-100 [0-160]) mEq vs 70 (40-163 [0-260]) mEq, respectively, p=0.018). Postoperative clinical outcomes and laboratory-measured hepatic and renal function did not differ between the groups. Increased vascular resistance and reduction of portal blood flow by intra-operative phenylephrine infusion is assumed to decrease the amount of intra-operative bleeding and thereby ameliorate the progression of lactic acidosis during liver transplant surgery."

However, contact activation and Factor XI have enhanced thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activation and decreased fibrinolysis, and Factor XIII (FXIII) also delays fibrinolysis via alpha(2)-anti-plasmin deposition on fibrin polymers. Thus, the goals of this study were to define how fibrinolysis is modulated in human plasma by contact or tissue factor (TF) activation, and what role TAFI and FXIII plays in this system."

Subjects in the highest intensity re-infection group (> 100 eggs per gram faeces) had significantly higher levels of IgG1 and IgG4 against AWA. Analysis of IgG4/IgE ratios for AWA and SEA linked IgG4 excess to re-infection and IgE excess to non-re-infection. Two years after chemotherapeutic cure, 29 subjects, who were re-infected or never infected but highly water-exposed, were classified as epidemiologically susceptible (n = 15) or epidemiologically insusceptible to infection (n = 14). IgG4 levels against native antigens (AWA and SEA) were higher in susceptible and IgE levels were higher in insusceptible but antibody responses to the recombinant proteins (PMY and TEG) showed no clear pattern or difference between susceptibility groups. These and earlier findings provide evidence that immunity develops against schistosomiasis japonica in China and that susceptibility/resistance correlates with antibody isotypes against native schistosome antigens."
CD010438,0,2525287,0,Applications of ultraviolet light in the preparation of platelet concentrates.,"Passenger lymphocytes in platelet concentrates (PCs) may induce the formation of lymphocytotoxic antibodies (LCTAbs) and subsequent refractoriness to platelet transfusions. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation can prevent lymphocytes' acting as stimulator or responder cells in mixed-lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) and could theoretically prevent LCTAb formation in vivo. A system has been devised for the delivery of UV irradiation to PCs; platelet storage characteristics and MLRs were evaluated in UV-irradiated PCs harvested from healthy donors with the Haemonetics V50 and PCS cell separators. MLR and response to phytohemagglutinin stimulation were abolished by a dose of 3000 joules per m2 at a mean wavelength of 310 nm. Platelet aggregatory responses to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), ristocetin, collagen and epinephrine, hypotonic shock response, and pH showed no important differences when control PCs and PCs irradiated as above were compared during 5 days of storage in Fenwal PL-1240 packs. Lactate production during storage was significantly higher in UV-treated PCs (p less than 0.001), but values did not exceed 20 mmol per L. UV transmission at 310 nm in standard blood product containers, including the Fenwal PL-146, PL-1240, and PL-732, was low (less than 30%), but it was acceptable in the Delmed Cryostorage and DuPont SteriCell packs (greater than 50%). UV irradiation may provide a simple and inexpensive means of producing nonimmunogenic PCs."

In addition, various coagulation analyses were performed at frequent intervals. This study consisted of 292 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, who were randomly divided into two groups: 148 patients (group I) receiving autotransfusion (immediate centrifugation of oxygenator content after termination of cardiopulmonary bypass) were compared to 144 patients without autologous transfusion (group II). In the group of autotransfused patients, a mean of 2.27 units of bank blood were used throughout their entire hospital stay, as compared to 6.12 units of homologous blood in the other group (II) without autotransfusion. There were no significant differences between the two groups in respect of laboratory parameters and clinical course during the perioperative period. The data presented indicate a significant reduction in bank blood usage, thus protecting the patients from various hazards accompanying homologous blood transfusion (hepatitis, AIDS). Since the cost of Haemonetics software is recovered by 1.25 units of bank blood, a cost reduction of about US $135.-was achieved."

The peptides, all of which have been described previously, are designated HP6-3, Ts45W-1, Ts45W-5, Ts45S-10 and TEG-1. In clinically verified and seropositive hospital cases, combining the results of three of the individual peptide-based ELISAs (HP6-3, Ts45W-1 and Ts45W-5) afforded the best balance between sensitivity (85%) and specificity (83.5%), a significant improvement on the 63.6% specificity obtained with the routinely employed T. solium cyst-fluid-based ELISA. Similarly, in the seropositive Venezuelan endemic zone samples, 89.09% of Amerindians, 77.27% of symptomatic rural subjects and 67.83% of non-symptomatic rural subjects were also classed as seropositive by the combined peptide-based ELISAs.

CD010438,0,15502019,0,A novel thrombelastograph tissue factor/kaolin assay of activated clotting times for monitoring heparin anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass.,"We used a thrombelastograph (TEG) assay with tissue factor and kaolin (TEG TF/K) to measure activated clotting time (ACT) in 31 patients during cardiopulmonary bypass. For comparison, ACTs were also determined by a Hemochron Jr. Signature and a Hepcon HMS. The TEG TF/K correlated with both the Hepcon (r(2) = 0.789) and Hemochron (r(2) = 0.743) ACTs. The average ACT after heparin was 319 +/- 119 s (mean +/- sd) for the TEG TF/K compared with 624 +/- 118 s for the Hepcon instrument. To evaluate the effects of hemodilution on TEG TF/K and Hemochron assays, ACT assays were performed on blood diluted to 50% and titrated with heparin from 0 to 6 U/mL. Both instruments showed significant (P < 0.01) changes in the ACT-versus-heparin slope, but the 0 heparin intercept for the TEG TF/K ACTs was not significantly changed (P = 0.292), in contrast to that for the Hemochron device (P = 0.041). Both instruments also indicated the same 1.3:1 ratio of protamine to heparin for optimum heparin neutralization, with increasing ACTs at ratios >2.6:1. The TEG TF/K ACT assay rapidly monitors heparin anticoagulation, in addition to the capabilities of this instrument to monitor platelet function, clotting factors, and fibrinolysis."
CD010438,0,1208124,0,Effect of angiotensin II upon platelet adhesiveness and the thrombelastogram in patients with essential arterial hypertension.,"Platelet adhesiveness increases significantly after angiotensin II administration, in pressor and subpressor doses, only in the hypertensive patients with urinary infection. The k index on the thrombelastogram decreases significantly following angiotensin II infusion in pressor doses both in the hypertensive patients with urinary infection and in those without urinary infection. At the same time, angiotensin II infusion in pressor and subpressor doses determines a significant increase of epsilon index in both hypertensive patients with urinary infection and in those without urinary infection. These results pose the problem of thrombocyte sensitization by the urinary infection to the vasopressor substance. The increased tendency to thrombosis by angiotensin, in hypertensive patients with urinary infection, could constitute a mechanism of malignant transformation of arterial hypertension."

Patients were randomized to three groups and given one of three drugs prophylactically: tranexamic acid, 10 mg. kg(-1). h(-1); epsilon-aminocaproic acid, 16 mg. kg(-1). h(-1), and placebo (isotonic saline). Perioperative management was standardized. Coagulation tests, thromboelastogram, and blood requirements were recorded during OLT and in the first 24 h. There were no differences in diagnosis, Child score, or preoperative coagulation tests among groups. Administration of packed red blood cells was significantly reduced (P = 0.023) during OLT in the tranexamic acid group, but not in the epsilon-aminocaproic acid group. There were no differences in transfusion requirements after OLT. Thromboembolic events, reoperations, and mortality were similar in the three groups. Prophylactic administration of tranexamic acid, but not epsilon-aminocaproic acid, significantly reduces total packed red blood cell usage during OLT."
CD010438,0,16790652,0,The value of an albumin-based intravascular volume replacement strategy in elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.,"The value of human albumin (HA) for treating hypovolemia is controversial. Less expensive alternatives such as hydroxyethyl starch (HES) are sometimes refused because of unwanted side effects. We prospectively randomized 50 patients older than 70 years old undergoing major abdominal surgery to receive either 5% HA (n = 25) or a third generation HES preparation (6% HES 130/0.4; n = 25) when mean arterial blood pressure was <60 mm Hg and central venous pressure was <10 mm Hg. Hemodynamics, inflammation (interleukin-6), endothelial activation-integrity (adhesion molecules), coagulation (thrombelastography), and renal function (including kidney-specific proteins) were monitored after the induction of anesthesia, after surgery, 5 h in the intensive care unit, and on the first postoperative day. HA patients received 3960 +/- 590 mL of HA and 5070 +/- 1030 mL of Ringer's lactate solution, and HES patients received 3500 +/- 530 mL of HES and 4550 +/- 880 mL of Ringer's lactate solution. Total protein remained normal only in the HA-treated patients. No significant differences (P > 0.1) between the groups were seen with regard to hemodynamics, coagulation, and kidney function. Plasma levels of interleukin-6 and soluble adhesion molecules were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the HA- than in the HES-treated patients. We conclude that HA in elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery can easily be replaced by a modern HES preparation. Because of the decreased inflammatory response and endothelial activation-injury, HES 130/0.4 seems to be the more appropriate fluid strategy for these patients."

Some of these reported effects are, however, procoagulative and others anticoagulative. The aim of this study was to ascertain the effect of elastase on the in vivo hemostatic competency. The effect of elastase activity on the hemostatic competency was determined in a group of 50 surgical intensive care unit patients and 23 control subjects. Surgical intensive care unit patients were subgrouped into a surgery, a trauma, and a sepsis-multiple organ failure group. Elastase activity was assessed by elastase-alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor levels and hemostatic competency by thromboelastography. Thromboelastography results showed a relatively normal coagulative ability in the surgery group, a varying degree of thromboelastographic hypocoagulability in the trauma group, and pronounced thromboelastographic instability in the sepsis-multiple organ failure group. Increases in elastase-alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor levels up to 200 micrograms/L were accompanied by a compromised coagulative ability as seen in a prolongation of both the first and second phases of the clotting time, as well as a decrease in the maximal clot elasticity."

The authors compared thromboxane B2, platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin, and thromboelastography in systemic blood as markers of thrombogenicity during hemodialysis in eight patients with an increased risk of bleeding. Measurements were performed during hemodialysis with and without heparin. Thromboxane B2 levels in centrifuged blood were evaluated by an 125I assay system using a special extraction with mini-columns and magnetic separation (normal 32-64 pg/ml). At the onset of hemodialysis, thromboxane B2 concentrations in the inflow arterial blood line were lower than normal (30 +/- 23 pg/ml). Thromboxane B2 increased (97 +/- 105 versus 40 +/- 26 pg/ml) and was significantly higher during heparin free hemodialysis than during hemodialysis with heparin (p = 0.01, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test). The highest values were observed in 5 cases with signs of clotting (152 +/- 122 pg/ml). Among the investigated parameters, thromboxane B2 proved to be the most significant serum parameter correlated with platelet activation and the consequently increased risk of incipient clotting during heparin free hemodialysis."

CD010438,0,20708846,0,Acute coagulopathy of trauma: balancing progressive catecholamine induced endothelial activation and damage by fluid phase anticoagulation.,"Acute coagulopathy of trauma predicts a poor clinical outcome. Tissue trauma activates the sympathoadrenal system resulting in high circulating levels of catecholamines that influence hemostasis dose-dependently through immediate effects on the two major compartments of hemostasis, i.e., the circulating blood and the vascular endothelium. There appears to be a dose-dependency with regards to injury severity and the hemostatic response to trauma evaluated in whole blood by viscoelastic assays like thrombelastography (TEG), changing from normal to hypercoagulable, to hypocoagulable and finally hyperfibrinolytic in severely injured patients. Since high catecholamine levels may directly damage the endothelium and thereby promote systemic coagulation activation, we hypothesize that the progressive hypocoagulability and ultimate hyperfibrinolysis observed in whole blood with increasing injury severity, is an evolutionary developed response that counterbalances the injury and catecholamine induced endothelial activation and damage. Given this, the rise in circulating catecholamines in trauma patients may favor a switch from hyper- to hypocoagulability in the blood to keep the progressively more procoagulant microvasculature open. The hypothesis delineated in the present paper thus infers that the state of the fluid phase, including its cellular elements, is a consequence of the degree of the tissue injury and importantly, critically related to the degree of endothelial damage, with a progressively more procoagulant endothelium inducing a gradient of increasing anticoagulation towards the fluid phase. The implications of this hypothesis may include targeted treatment strategies according to the degree of sympathoadrenal response as evaluated by whole blood viscoelastical hemostatic assays in trauma patients."

CD010438,0,22079443,0,Thrombin generation in clinical conditions.,"Commercial assays for determining thrombin generation in plasma are being tested in clinical conditions associated with thrombosis or bleeding. While pre-analytical conditions remain a source of inter laboratory variation, demanding for further standardization, clinical research proceeds. In patients at risk of venous thrombosis thrombin generation (TG) analysis may be utilized to detect underlying thrombophilia and this has been achieved both with addition of thrombomodulin or activated protein C, to test the contribution of the protein C system. In patients with documented venous thromboembolism, increased TG values are seen in those patients at greatest risk for recurrence, although the data are not consistent yet. In patients with arterial vascular disease, effects on TG patterns are seen that both reflect atherosclerosis (and its risk factors) and link to risk of recurrent atherothrombosis (coronary or stroke), but the data are limited. In patients with a bleeding diathesis, like hemophilia, the main importance of TG assays lies in the application for monitoring replacement therapy, either with factor concentrate or rFVIIa. An interesting application is in conjunction with thromboelastography, for monitoring peri-operative transfusion policy. Finally, TG analysis may contribute to monitoring anticoagulant drug treatment, but these and other applications would greatly benefit from whole blood, point of care applications of TG testing."

The numerical equivalent of about five single units of platelets collected at each pheresis were frozen together in a -80 C mechanical freezer with a 6% final concentration of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as the cryoprotectant. Platelet freeze-thaw-wash recovery in vitro was about 80 per cent and the platelet recovery value depended upon the method used to enumerate the platelets. The 51Cr survival values in vivo were about 50 per cent less than those in fresh platelets. These values were not significantly different from those seen when platelets were isolated from single units of blood by differential serial centrifugation. Transfusion of two and one-half units of freeze-preserved platelets provided an increase in the recipient's circulating platelet count comparable with that from one unit of fresh platelets. The hemostatic effectiveness of freeze-preserved platelets isolated by discontinuous-flow centrifugation has not yet been studied.

CD010438,0,18322882,0,Treatment of massive cecal bleeding in a 28-Year-old patient with homozygous factor V deficiency with activated factor VII.,"Factor V deficiency is usually accompanied with recurrent epistaxis, menorrhagia and haemorrhages after trauma. So far, gastrointestinal bleeding has not been reported. We describe here the first case of severe cecal bleeding in a 28-year-old woman with homozygous factor V deficiency. As a reasonable alternative to large amounts of fresh frozen plasma, we indicated recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), as supra-physiological concentrations directly activate factor X and prothrombin on the surface of activated platelets. With this regimen, the bleeding immediately stopped and the patient was discharged three days later. Rotation thromboelastometry studies showed a marked improvement in clot generation after rFVIIa infusion. We conclude that massive cecal mucosal bleeding is a possible manifestation of homozygous factor V deficiency and rFVIIa could be a successful therapy."

CD010438,0,18682908,0,[Coagulation management of severe surgical bleeding].,"Severe intraoperative bleeding may endanger the patient's life, necessitate additional human resources and increase perioperative costs. The aetiology of perioperative coagulopathy is complex and consists of depletion, consumption and dilution of clotting factors and thrombocytes. Cofactors like hypothermia, acidosis and severe anaemia may aggravate coagulopathy. Previously healthy patients often show hypofibrinogenaemia as the primary trigger of coagulopathy, whereas thrombocytopenia rather is a late event during massive bleeding. Early and differentiated diagnosis is essential for initiating targeted therapy. Evaluation of the clinical bleeding situation and coagulation tests, in particular point-of-care testing like thrombelastography, should be used to guide and control the therapeutic strategy. Fresh frozen plasma, concentrates of clotting factors, platelet concentrates and antifibrinolytic drugs are available for therapy of perioperative coagulopathy. To obtain optimal benefit for the patient, these products should be applied based on a therapeutic algorithm."
CD010438,0,20523162,0,Characterization of the plasma and blood anticoagulant potential of structurally and mechanistically novel oligomers of 4-hydroxycinnamic acids.,"Recently, we designed sulfated dehydropolymers (DHPs) of 4-hydroxycinnamic acids that displayed interesting anticoagulant properties. Structurally and mechanistically, sulfated DHPs are radically different from all the anticoagulants studied to date. To assess whether their unique mechanism and structure is worth exploiting for further rational design of homogeneous DHP-based molecules, we investigated their anticoagulant potential in human plasma and blood using a range of clotting assays. Sulfated DHPs prolong plasma clotting times, prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times at concentrations comparable to the clinically used low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin. Fibrin formation studies on human plasma show that there is a structural dependence of anticoagulant action. Human whole blood studies using thromboelastography and hemostasis analysis system indicate that they are 17-140-fold less potent than enoxaparin. These results demonstrate that sulfated DHPs possess good in-vitro and ex-vivo activity, which will likely be improved through a rational design."

Within 30 minutes, it provides a global account of clot formation and fibrinolysis or the time and degree of the interaction between the activators and inhibitors of both systems. On the basis of our own experience, it seems justifiable to assert that although its sensitivity to technical variables requires stringent laboratory control, the TEG offers a simple, reliable method of defining the key areas of hemostatic incompetence or for assessing the efficacy of a therapeutic program. Thrombelastographic hypercoagulability, which has deservedly been given prominence in the recent literature, may add an exciting dimension to the diagnostic spectrum of an elegantly conceived instrument."

ISTH classifications of overt and non-overt human DIC have proven to have a high diagnostic accuracy, and we have previously established a rabbit model of non-overt DIC based on the ISTH classification of non-overt DIC. In this rabbit model, we used purified rabbit brain thromboplastin to induce DIC and test applicability of ISTH classifications of overt human DIC. Cardiovascular and haematological parameters from rabbits, either saline-injected or administered a 2.5 mg thromboplastin/kg bolus and a 15 minutes 1.25 mg thromboplastin/kg infusion, were determined at four time points over a 90 minute period. All groups of rabbits were scored at each time point according to the ISTH classifications of overt DIC. Despite the fact that injection of purified thromboplastin resulted in decreased platelet count, increased prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, level of thrombin-antithrombin complexes and fibrin degradation products, and pulmonary micro-thrombosis, none of the rabbits were diagnosed as having overt DIC according to ISTH classification. We conclude that purified thromboplastin causes haemostatic abnormalities in the rabbit but this experimental model was not diagnosed as overt DIC."

CD010438,0,20456686,0,Double red cell concentrates -in vitro quality after delayed refrigeration.,"Automated collection of red cell concentrates (RCC) presents a number of potential advantages to donors, blood services and recipients, and allows the collection of finished components from sites that are remote from a blood centre. However, data are lacking on how long the collected RCC may be stored at ambient temperature prior to their final storage at 4 °C. In this study, the Haemonetics Cymbal device was used to collect RCC using citrate, phosphate and dextrose (CPD-50) anticoagulant. A total of 10 procedures each yielded two leucodepleted RCC in saline, adenine, glucose and mannitol (SAGM) additive solution. One of each pair of RCC was kept warm in an insulated transport bag for 8 h and the other for 6 h. In vitro assessments of the quality of the RCC were made during subsequent 42-day storage of the RCC at 2-6 °C, and compared with reference data. All collected RCC were within UK and European limits for volume, haematocrit and haemoglobin content. Haemolysis was within specification at Day 42 and was no different in RCC held warm for 6 or 8 hours, but tended to be higher than reference data from whole blood derived RCC. ATP, 2,3 DPG and supernatant potassium levels were all similar in RCC held warm for 6 or 8 hours and reference data. We conclude that the Cymbal device may be used to collect two RCC in SAGM, and the in vitro assessment indicates that RCC may be stored without refrigeration for up to 8 h following collection, prior to final storage at 4 °C."

Unexpectedly, this excessive erythrocytosis did not lead to thrombembolic complications in all investigated organs at any age. Thus, we investigated the mechanisms preventing thrombembolism in this mouse model. Blood analysis revealed an age-dependent elevation of reticulocyte numbers and a marked thrombocytopenia that matched the reduced megakaryocyte numbers in the bone marrow. However, platelet counts were not different from wild-type controls, when calculations were based on the distribution (eg, plasma) volume, thereby explaining why thrombopoietin levels did not increase in transgenic mice. Nevertheless, bleeding time was significantly increased in transgenic animals. A longitudinal investigation using computerized thromboelastography revealed that thrombus formation was reduced with increasing age from 1 to 8 months in transgenic animals. We observed that increasing erythrocyte concentrations inhibited profoundly and reversibly thrombus formation and prolonged the time of clot development, most likely due to mechanical interference of red blood cells with clot-forming platelets. Transgenic animals showed increased nitric oxide levels in the blood that could inhibit vasoconstriction and platelet activation. Finally, we observed that plasmatic coagulation activity in transgenic animals was significantly decreased. Taken together, our findings suggest that prevention of thrombembolic disease in these erythrocytotic transgenic mice was due to functional consequences inherent to increased erythrocyte concentrations and a reduction of plasmatic coagulation activity, the cause of which remains to be elucidated."

CD010438,0,17426904,0,Coagulopathy: its pathophysiology and treatment in the injured patient.,"Hemorrhage continues to be one of the leading causes of death following trauma. Trauma patients are susceptible to the early development of coagulopathy and the most severely injured patients are coagulopathic on hospital admission. Hypothermia, acidosis, and dilution from standard resuscitation can worsen the presenting coagulopathy and perpetuate bleeding. Early identification of coagulopathy is dependent on clinical awareness and point of care laboratory values. Routinely used laboratory coagulation parameters fail to adequately describe this state. Thrombelastography is a test that can be done at the bedside and uses whole blood to provide a functional evaluation of coagulation. Rapid diagnosis of coagulopathy, followed by prevention or correction of hypothermia and acidosis should be a priority during the initial evaluation and resuscitation. Judicious use of resuscitation fluids and early replacement of coagulation factors will help prevent iatrogenic hemodilution. This review covers the pathophysiology as well as the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of coagulopathy. Prevention and treatment strategies are discussed, including early transfusion of coagulation factors during massive transfusion and the use of recombinant factor VIIa. Damage control resuscitation is briefly discussed, and it involves the combination of hypotensive resuscitation and hemostatic resuscitation. Finally, a description of the use of fresh whole blood in the military setting is included. Its use has been proven to be safe and beneficial in this setting and warrants further investigation as an adjunct to the management of civilian trauma patients."
CD010438,0,3929386,0,A modified stasis thrombosis model to study the antithrombotic actions of heparin and its fractions.,"The original stasis thrombosis model of Wessler has been modified. Numerous thrombogenic agents were evaluated for their pathophysiologic effects and were classified in terms of stasis clot in the jugular vein. Alterations produced in coagulation parameters, such as the PT, APTT, thrombin time, activated recalcification time (Hemachron), and thrombelastographic pattern were recorded. Since the pathophysiologic activation of the hemostatic system varies considerably in different diseases, a proper animal model along with a proper type of thrombogenic trigger should be carefully selected to produce pathogenesis and to study the therapeutic responses of heparin and its derivatives. In the modified stasis thrombosis model, besides monitoring the formation of the jugular vein stasis clot, it is proposed that the following tests may be useful to establish hypercoagulable states: Functional levels of various coagulation factors, platelet counts, fibrinogen levels, and whole blood activated clotting times. The nature of activation processes in each thrombogenic challenge should be carefully analyzed in terms of pathways involved; for example, the administration of heterologous serum (such as human, monkey) to rabbits produces anaphylactoid reactions, including hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, clinical chemistry abnormalities (enzymes), and many problems that may involve the complement and immune systems. All previous data obtained using heterologous sera as a thrombogenic trigger are of questionable value as to the efficacy of some of the antithrombotic agents tested against it. In addition to the species and the thrombogenic challenge, the following factors may contribute significantly to the pathophysiologic response and its alteration by various agents: (1) Composition of the thrombogenic agent; (2) effect of preparatory drugs, such as anesthetics, on the hemostatic parameters; (3) alterations on injection time, volume, osmolarity, and temperature; (4) variations in the circulation time of the thrombogenic agent and stasis time of the ligated jugular vein stasis segment; and (5) blood sample collection and handling. Since the kallikrein-kinin cascade is closely associated with the coagulation and the fibrinolytic network, a systemic monitoring of blood pressure may provide information on the effect of thrombogenic agents on hemodynamics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD010438,0,15920213,0,The effects of platelet count on clot retraction and tissue plasminogen activator-induced fibrinolysis on thrombelastography.,"Clot retraction and fibrinolysis may present as a decrease in amplitude on thrombelastography (TEG). The former represents normal or hyperactive platelet function, and the latter represents a fibrinolytic state. It is important to distinguish clot retraction from fibrinolysis because the treatment of each condition is different. To distinguish between these phenomena, we performed TEG with platelet-poor plasma (PPP) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) with an increasing platelet count (range, 50-1200 x 10(9)/L) with or without abciximab. Maximum amplitude (MA) and the percentage decrease of amplitude at 30 and 60 min after MA were examined for each sample. Blood samples to which tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was added served as positive controls for fibrinolysis. Morphological changes of clots and D-dimer levels were also examined. With higher platelet counts, the percentage decrease of amplitude after MA increased significantly at 30 and 60 min, but not in the abciximab samples. Morphological changes of clots have shown clot retraction in PRP, but not in PPP or PRP pretreated with abciximab. D-dimer levels increased only in samples to which tPA was added, but not in native PPP or PRP samples. In conclusion, we have shown that the decrease in amplitude at 30 and 60 min can be due to platelet-mediated clot retraction and can be attenuated by sample pretreatment with abciximab, which interrupts platelet-fibrin(ogen) binding."

Samples were from women who delivered a neonate after at least 34 weeks of gestation in normal pregnancies. From the recovered placenta, cord blood from the umbilical vein or artery was collected within 30 minutes after delivery and tested. Neonatal TEG reaction time (time clot formation begins), clot firmness (shear elastic modulus strength), and platelet function analysis closure times were significantly lower than those in adult ranges (P< .001). When compared with the values for children, TEG reaction time, angle, coagulation index, clot firmness value, and clot kinetics (time from clot formation to time amplitude reaches 20 mm) were significantly different (P< .001) among neonates.

We performed an in vitro study to assess the ability of a modification of the thromboelastograph (MTEG) to detect inhibition of clot strength by c7E3 Fab and its reversal with platelet-rich plasma (PRP). In the modified assay (MTEG), thrombin was added to whole blood (WB) and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) and the resultant maximum amplitude (MA) was measured, MAWB and MAPPP, respectively. Anticoagulated blood samples from 17 patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were collected for a dose response (Part I; n = 5) and c7E3 Fab reversal (Part II; n = 12) study. Clot strength was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by c7E3 Fab. Ecteola cellulose effectively reversed the effect of heparin on the thrombin time and the addition of PRP significantly increased the MAWB (P < 0.0001) and MAWP-PPP (P < 0.0001). Subtracting the MAPPP from MAWB significantly magnified the response of MA to the addition of c7E3 Fab (P = 0.002) and its reversal with PRP (P = 0.005). This in vitro study indicates that the MTEG is a responsive assay demonstrating that inhibition by the antiplatelet c7E3 Fab is reversible with PRP."
CD010438,0,20402168,0,Perioperative coagulation monitoring.,"Perioperative coagulation monitoring is the rational diagnostic basis for pro- and anti-thrombotic interventions in patients undergoing emergency and elective surgery. The main goal of perioperative monitoring of haemostasis is to increase safety of patients undergoing surgical procedures. Currently, there is a change in paradigm with (1) increasing implementation of evidence-based approach to preoperative patient evaluation with laboratory coagulation testing secondary to the results of the standardised bleeding history and (2) awareness of the limitations of routine coagulation tests to guide coagulation management in massive bleeding. Alternatively, visco-elastic point-of-care monitoring is increasingly used worldwide. This innovative methodology triggers a trend towards an 'early goal-directed coagulation management' focussing on potent coagulation factor concentrates. Practicability, cost-effectiveness, safety and--above all--growing scientific evidence support this concept, and lively discussions among anaesthesiologists and various medical disciplines may help to refine it. The present review focusses on the following key issues of perioperative coagulation monitoring: standardised bleeding history, routine coagulation testing, visco-elastic point-of-care coagulation testing, heparin monitoring, and platelet function testing."

We improve hemostasis in vivo using a conformationally pliant variant of coagulation factor Xa (FXa(I16L)) rendered partially inactive by a defect in the transition from zymogen to active protease. Using mouse models of hemophilia, we show that FXa(I16L) has a longer half-life than wild-type FXa and does not cause excessive activation of coagulation. Once clotting mechanisms are activated to produce its cofactor FVa, FXa(I16L) is driven to the protease state and restores hemostasis in hemophilic animals upon vascular injury. Moreover, using human or murine analogs, we show that FXa(I16L) is more efficacious than FVIIa, which is used to treat bleeding in hemophilia inhibitor patients. FXa(I16L) may provide an effective strategy to enhance blood clot formation and act as a rapid pan-hemostatic agent for the treatment of bleeding conditions."

CD010438,0,20035517,0,Use of thromboelastography PlateletMapping to monitor antithrombotic therapy in a patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome.,"Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is the end result of a number of disease states resulting in hepatic venous outflow obstruction. We report a Janus kinase 2-homozygous patient with BCS who thrombosed a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) despite treatment with warfarin (international normalized ratio = 3.0), aspirin, and clopidogrel. PlateletMapping (Haemonetics Corp.) is a novel point-of-care assay of platelet function based on thromboelastography (TEG) that has the ability to detect platelet inhibition (%) by antiplatelet therapy. Initial PlateletMapping traces showed no platelet inhibition by aspirin or clopidogrel but demonstrated adequate suppression of plasmatic coagulation. On this basis, the aspirin dose was doubled, and this resulted in a significant increase in platelet inhibition (45%). To further suppress platelet activity, the patient was started on tirofiban, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Repeat PlateletMapping revealed 100% inhibition of platelets by both pathways, and this coincided with angiographic evidence of TIPS blood flow. Subsequently, the patient developed bleeding from the venous access sites. TEG demonstrated poor underlying plasmatic coagulation with a prolonged R time of 9.2 minutes (normal = 2-8 minutes), and the international normalized ratio was found to be supratherapeutic (>4). Treatment with fresh frozen plasma stopped the bleeding without compromising the platelet inhibition. This case demonstrates that increased platelet activation may contribute to the development of thromboses in BCS. Despite the standard dose of dual antiplatelet therapy, there was minimal inhibition in platelet function, and anticoagulation with warfarin alone was not adequate to prevent thrombotic events. PlateletMapping was used to assess and then optimize the antiplatelet treatment while facilitating the management of complications without an increased risk of thrombosis."

In healthy subjects and in patients with uncomplicated ulcer, the beta 2-adrenoagonist caused an increase in the volume of basal secretion, production of acid and pepsin, acceleration of blood coagulation, and fibrinolysis activation. At the same time in 2/3 of patients with a history of hemorrhages due to duodenal ulcer alupent inhibited gastric secretion of acid and pepsin and, along with stimulation of plasmic factors of coagulation, inhibited activated fibrinolysis. Vegetative dysfunction in patients with uncomplicated ulcer was marked by the predominance of the parasympathetic regulation of the cardiac rhythm, whereas in patients with a history of hemorrhages by sympatheticotonia. These features of beta 2-adrenergic regulation can be used for predicting hemorrhages and development of pathogenetically validated treatment methods."

CD010438,0,15481628,0,Monitoring of hemostatic status in four patients being treated with recombinant factor VIIa.,"Recombinant Factor VIIa (rVIIa) is a potent hemostatic agent for the management of refractory bleeding in patients with Factor VII deficiency or Factor VIII inhibitors. While the current recommended dose is usually effective, the most appropriate dose remains a subject of debate. Since factor VII levels and shortening of the pro-thrombin time do not appear to correlate with response, an appropriate laboratory marker of clinical response has not been identified. In this article we report changes noted in thrombin generation, platelet function and clot structure in blood from patients treated with rVIIa. Thrombin generation was assessed via a thrombin generation time (TGT) assay using a Hemodyne HAS instrument. Changes in clot structure were assessed as changes in clot elastic modulus in the HAS, changes in maximum amplitude in the TEG and changes in maximum clot firmness in the ROTEG. The cases presented confirmed improvement in thrombin generation with administration of rVIIa. The cases also illustrate that: a) in the factor VII deficient patient, 25% of the 90 microg/kg dose is sufficient to totally correct the defect, b) patients with high level factor VIII inhibitors may require significantly more than the recommended dose of 90 microg/kg, c) thrombin generation may not be completely corrected despite dramatic shortening of the prothrombin time, and d) increasing rVIIa doses does not by itself ensure improved thrombin generation."
CD010438,0,10174276,0,Cytokines in platelet concentrates: a comparison of apheresis platelet (haemonetics) and filtered and unfiltered pooled buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates.,"Variable degrees of platelet activation, shape changes, microvesiculation and fragmentation may occur during collection, processing and storage of platelet concentrates (PCs), contributing to different rate of platelet storage lesion. Leukocytes contribute to both the frequency of transfusion reactions and the acceleration of the rate of platelet storage lesion hence leukocyte removal of platelet concentrates has been introduced to overcome these problems. However transfusion reaction can still occur with the use of leuko-reduced products and it is not fully elucidated that the rate of storage lesion is equivalent for filtered and unfiltered counter parts. This issue has been addressed in this manuscript comparing the generation of cytokines during storage in PCs derived from pooled buffy coat with the standard apheresis products, with a similar level of leukocyte contamination. The EDTA-induced shape change in platelet was used as an index of platelet functional integrity. In addition IL-8 and TGF beta were used as indicators of filtration process-inducing stimulation of cytokines. Our results clearly indicate that a rapid disc/spheric conversion occurs during storage of buffy-coat derived PC, and while prestorage filtration reduces both IL-8 content immediately after filtration and at the end of platelet shelf life but such a process may lead to slight enhancement of the rate of TGF beta generation indicating that any additional process may have some bearing in stimulation of TGF beta release."

CD010438,0,21667202,0,Cardiac catheterization: haemostatic changes in pediatric versus adult patients.,"Thrombophilic or haemorrhagic complications are possible adverse events following cardiac catheterization particularly in pediatric patients. It was therefore the aim of our study to compare the cardiac catheterization-related haemostatic changes in children with that in adults. The total of 50 patients was subdivided into Gr I (1-6 years), Gr II (7-18 years), and Gr III (19-58 years). Parameters of coagulation activation, plasma levels of various clotting factors and heparinase-modified thrombelastometry parameters were determined prior and immediately after cardiac catheterization. The haemostatic system of pediatric patients was markedly more affected by the procedure than that of adults. Levels of thrombin/antithrombin complex and prothrombin fragment 1+2 in the post-catheter plasma samples were significantly increased in Grs I and II, not in Gr III. The catheter-related decrease in fibrinogen and F II levels was higher in Gr I than in Grs II and III. F VII levels were significantly decreased in Grs I and II, not in Gr III. The catheter-related prolongation of Coagulation times was highest in Gr I, followed by Gr II and finally Gr III. A significant catheter-related decrease of maximum clot firmness was observed solely in Gr I. Our results show that cardiac catheterisation perturbs the haemostatic system of adults, and, even more pronounced, that of pediatric patients. Thus, our results indicate that children might be at a higher risk for either thrombotic complications or post-operative bleeding events than adults."

The structures of TEG and the synthesized Cu-Ni/TEG catalysts were characterized using BET, FTIR, TG, SEM, TEM, XRD and TPR techniques. The catalytic activities of the prepared catalysts were investigated by performing micro-reaction in the direct synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) from CH3OH and CO2. The experimental results indicated that the prepared Cu-Ni/TEG catalysts exhibited highly catalytic activity. Under the optimal catalytic conditions at 100 degrees C and under 1.2 MPa, the highest conversion of CH3OH of 4.97% and high selectivity of DMC of 89.3% can be achieved. The highly catalytic activity of Cu-Ni/TEG in DMC synthesis can be attributed to the synergetic effects of metal Cu, Ni and Cu-Ni alloy in the activation of CH3OH and CO2 and the particular characteristics of TEG as a carbon support material."

Functional assays performed in vitro, evaluating antiprotease activity mediated via antithrombin III, heparin cofactor II interactions, antithrombin III binding, and plasma protein binding, showed wide variations between LMWHs, indicating that compositional differences among the LMWHs have a major impact on function. Evaluation in vitro showed varying potency in United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and anti-Xa assays. LMWHs tested at anti-Xa-adjusted concentrations exhibited varying potencies with anti-IIa, Heptest, and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assays. Evaluation of these assays showed differences between LMWHs and a link with molecular weight. Each LMWH also varied in the in vitro neutralization by platelet factor 4, thrombin, and heparinase. LMWHs also varied in platelet interactions as assessed by whole blood clotting, thromboelastography and P-selectin expression, and in tissue factor pathway inhibitor release in cell culture. It was concluded that compositional variations in LMWHs give each product a unique biochemical profile. This profile, plus varying endogenous interactions and pharmacokinetic profiles may give rise to the clinical differences observed with LMWHs in specific indications."

CD010438,0,16269937,0,An evaluation of the procoagulant action of recombinant activated factor VII in cord whole blood versus adult whole blood using thromboelastography.,"Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has been reported to be effective in adult patients in various clinical situations and might be beneficial in neonates with bleeding tendency. In the present study we compared the procoagulant action of increasing amounts of rFVIIa in both cord whole blood and adult whole blood with respect to changes in the values of the clotting time, clot formation time, and maximum clot firmness by means of thromboelastography. Thromboelastography allows evaluation of the effects of rFVIIa on haemostasis in whole blood. When increasing amounts of rFVIIa were added in vitro to whole blood samples, significant decreases in the values of the clotting time and clot formation time and a significant increase in the maximum clot firmness were observed. Cord whole blood was significantly more sensitive to rFVIIa addition than adult whole blood, an effect probably attributable to the low anticoagulant capacity of the neonatal plasma. Maximum clot firmness values were significantly lower in cord whole blood than in adult whole blood, an effect mainly attributable to the hypofunctional state of neonatal platelets. Since cord whole blood exerted a significantly higher sensitivity to addition of rFVIIa, we speculate that lower doses of rFVIIa might be required to treat neonates with bleeding tendency compared with the adult rFVIIa administration strategy."
CD010438,0,15804156,0,Is platelet function as measured by Thrombelastograph monitoring in whole blood affected by platelet inhibitors?,"Platelet inhibitors, especially the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing the acute ischemic complications of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in improving clinical outcomes in patients with acute coronary crisis. Three common platelet inhibitors observed in emergent cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for failed PCI are abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban. An in vitro model was constructed in two parts to determine whether platelet aggregation inhibition induced by platelet inhibitors would be demonstrated by the Thrombelastograph (TEG) monitor when compared with baseline samples with no platelet inhibitor. In part A, 20 mL of fresh whole blood was divided into four groups: group I = baseline, group A = abcix-imab microg/mL, group E = eptifibatide ng/mL, and group T = tirofiban ng/mL. Platelet inhibitor concentrations in whole blood were derived starting with reported serum concentrations with escalation to achieve 80% platelet inhibition using the Medtronic hemoSTATUS and/or Lumi-aggregometer. A concentration range determined by our in vitro tests were chosen for each drug using concentrations achieving less than, equal to, or greater than 80% platelet inhibition. In part B, TEG analysis was then performed using baseline and concentrations for each drug derived in part A. Parameters measured were clot formation reaction time (R), coagulation time (K), maximum amplitude (MA) and alpha angle (A). Groups E1000 and E2000 extended R over control by 37% and 23%, respectively (p = 0.01 and 0.03). Groups E1000 and E2000 increased K times by 45% and 58% (p = .02 and .04). T160 samples prolonged K by 20% (p = 0.01). The angle or clot strength (A) was decreased in groups T160 and E1000 by 23% (+ 7.06 SD) and 18% (+ 11.23 SD), respectively (p = 0.001 and 0.01). The MA decrease was statistically significant in the T160, E1000 and E2000 by 9%, 6% and 13% respectively (p = 0.01). Samples treated with abciximab were comparable to control values for all parameters measured. Although statistical significance could be demonstrated with some parameters, sensitivity was only observed at increased doses and was not seen with all agents tested. In our in vitro model, the TEG monitor was unable to demonstrate clinically significant differences in platelet function and may not be reflective of platelet function in samples which have been treated with these GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors."
CD010438,0,21323795,0,Standardization of thromboelastography: a report from the TEG-ROTEM working group.,"Laboratory evaluation of bleeding disorders has been performed with the standard clotting assays such as the PT and PTT for several decades. Our improved understanding of the process of blood coagulation has now revealed the important role played by the cellular elements such as platelets, monocytes and red blood cells. The need for a test that can assess clotting in a more 'global' manner, beyond the initiation of clot formation, has led to greater interest in assays such as thrombin generation and thromboelastography. Even though there are several publications using thromboelastography it remains a research tool as the methodology is not standardized. In an attempt to show reproducibility and consistency using thromboelastography, a group of investigators from different countries joined hands to form the TEG-ROTEM Working Group. Two studies were performed using PRP and FVIII deficient plasma and an intrinsic pathway activator. This article summarizes the results of the first international effort at standardization of thromboelastography. Both of the instruments using this technology (TEG(®) and ROTEM(®)) were used. Nine laboratories from countries around the globe participated in this effort. The results showed a significant inter-laboratory variance with CV's greater than 10%. Although these results were not satisfactory, this has been the first effort to standardize this methodology and significant work remains to be done to improve reliability and reproducibility. These studies were performed on PRP and the results may be more reliable when preformed on whole blood samples. We believe that it is important to continue this work so that we may investigate the usefulness and potential applications of thromboelastography in the evaluation of bleeding and thrombosis."

The TFPI/FXa complex then subsequently binds with TF/activated factor VII (FVIIa) complex, ultimately inhibiting thrombin generation. Heparin administration causes endothelial release of TFPI concentrations up to sixfold normal values. Thrombelastography (TEG) is often used to monitor hemostasis in the perioperative period, and TFPI could potentially affect the diagnostic interpretation of TEG-based data, given its inhibition of both common and TF coagulation pathways. Thus, in this study we characterized the effect of TFPI on coagulation kinetics via TEG."
CD010438,0,22338860,0,[Monitoring of blood coagulation in perioperative care].,"Coagulation disorders often occur perioperatively and monitoring of blood coagulation should be fast and adequate to treat these disorders to protect patients from massive bleeding. Control of hemostasis is one of the main issues in major surgeries. Coagulation test results from a central laboratory may delay making such a perioperative decision. Recently, point-of-care monitoring (POCM), which is able to examine coagulation disorder in an operation theater with short waiting time, has become important. Both prothrombin time (PT) and activated clotting time (ACT) are very useful and popular, but also criticized because they can be monitored only until fibrin formation. On the other hand, viscoelastic monitorings of whole blood, are able to estimate fibrin formation, clot fixation, platelet function and fibrinolysis. In this review article, among variable perioperative POCMs of blood coagulation, three thromboelastographic monitorings, such as TEG ROTEM, and Sonoclot as well as PT and ACT, are described along with their utilities and limits to examine perioperative coagulation."

Assays were performed on 47 interventional cardiology and 24 general surgery patients receiving aspirin therapy for cardiovascular disease, as well as 48 volunteers asked to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or 12 volunteers on chronic NSAID therapy unrelated to diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Whole blood TEG monitoring of NSAID inhibition detected NSAID-insensitive AA activation of platelets in a significantly higher number of cardiology (23%) and surgery (25%) patients and normal volunteers on chronic NSAID (25%) therapy relative to normal subjects not on chronic NSAID therapy (0%). Whole blood NSAID insensitivity was observed with cyclooxygenase-I inhibitors, such as aspirin and ibuprofen; was not affected by Celebrex, a cyclooxygenase-II inhibitor; but was completely inhibited by thromboxane-receptor antagonists. This was not due to platelet NSAID insensitivity, because complete inhibition of AA-activation responses in PRP was observed with either TEG or OPA assays. We confirmed that thromboxane B(2) formation in PRP from NSAID-insensitive subjects was completely inhibited by NSAIDs. However, significant amounts were formed in whole blood from NSAID-insensitive subjects, but not in whole blood from NSAID-sensitive subjects. Thromboxane formation after AA addition was not found in washed blood cells with 90% reduced platelet counts or in leukocyte-rich buffy coat fractions, but could be restored by addition of PRP. NSAID-insensitive activation was inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid, with an IC(50) of 30 micromol, implicating 12- and/or 15-lipoxygenases in this transcellular pathway."

CD010438,0,11680728,0,Evaluation of post-cardiopulmonary bypass coagulation disorders by differential diagnosis with a multichannel modified thromboelastogram: a pilot investigation.,"We assessed a modified multichannel thromboelastogram for differentiation of the causes of coagulopathy after cardiopulmonary bypass and its suitability as a therapy guide. Thirty adult patients undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, who revealed a coagulopathy as observed by a prolonged activated clotting time of >150 sec after the application of protamine, were enrolled. Therapy was based on the results obtained by the computerized four-channel thromboelastogram with baseline, heparinase (2 IU/mL), heparinase/abciximab (5 microg/mL), and heparinase/fresh frozen plasma (25%) channels. The mean activated clotting time before therapy was 162.2+/-7.8 sec. Based on differential diagnosis with the modified multichannel thromboelastogram, two patients received protamine (30 mg), five desmopressin (0.4 microg/kg), 19 patients three units of fresh frozen plasma, two patients platelet transfusions, and two patients both protamine (30 mg) and three units of fresh frozen plasma. After therapy, there was a significant (p < .01) decrease of the activated clotting time to a mean value of 127+/-8.3 sec. Therapy based on the synoptic modified multichannel thromboelastogram analysis provides a guide for effective therapy of coagulopathy. However, elaboration is desirable, and larger clinical trials are necessary for a final evaluation of the protocol."
CD010438,0,17978172,0,"Efficacy and safety of a new-class hemostatic drug candidate, AV513, in dogs with hemophilia A.","AV513 is a select fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide of botanical origin. It inhibits tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) activity and accelerates clotting of human hemophilia A and B plasma. In prior work, subcutaneous administration of AV513 to mice with hemophilia A improved hemostasis. The current studies were designed to evaluate potential efficacy and safety in dogs with hemophilia A (hemophilia A dogs) with minimally increased hemostasis after adenoassociated viral-FVIII gene transfer and in treatment-naive severe hemophilia A dogs. AV513 administered subcutaneously to low-FVIII dogs for multiple weeks improved hemostasis as exhibited in thromboelastography (TEG) and cuticle bleeding time (CBT) tests. Moreover, AV513 administered orally to AAV-FVIII dogs and treatment-naive severe hemophilia A dogs for a multiweek dose-escalating period yielded correction to normal ranges in both TEG and CBT end points at 5 to 15 mg/kg and 15 to 20 mg/kg dose levels, respectively. In all 3 separate studies, throughout their duration, AV513 was well tolerated by the dogs without any adverse events. Additional pharmacologic characterization of AV513 included intravenous pharmacokinetic analysis in rats. In summary, the combination of safety and efficacy in 2 global tests of hemostasis in the hemophilia A dog model indicate that further evaluation of AV513 as a hemostatic agent in hemophilia A patients is warranted."
CD010438,0,19657320,0,Multicentric comparison of single portion reagents and liquid reagents for thromboelastometry.,"Thromboelastometry ROTEM (Pentapharm, Munich, Germany) is a viscoelastic method of whole blood clotting assessment with applications in perioperative hemostasis and hematology. The different tests available for the investigation of distinct coagulation aspects are performed with combinations of liquid reagents. The use of liquid reagents for the ROTEM measurement requires several pipetting steps, which complicates their application in clinical routine even though pipetting is performed semiautomatically. New single portion reagents (SPR) containing in one vial all lyophilized reagents necessary for each test have been recently developed. SPR require only addition of blood into the single-use reagent vial in a unique pipetting step in order to mix reagents with the blood sample. Our study compared SPR and standard liquid reagents (Pentapharm) in 21 blood samples from normal subjects and 46 samples from patients in three study centers. Following ROTEM tests were performed: EXTEM (extrinsically activated TEM), INTEM (intrinsically activated TEM), FIBTEM (fibrin-based TEM), APTEM (aprotinin-controlled TEM) and HEPTEM (heparin-insensitive TEM). In the second part of the study, the stability of SPR at 37 degrees C was also assessed on 23 blood samples in one center. Very good correlation was found between SPR and liquid reagents for all clotting parameters (correlation coefficient between 0.85-0.99). The SPR reagents showed excellent stability against thermic stress and the measurements were easier to perform than with the conventional liquid reagents system."

CD010438,0,7669463,0,"Effect of ketorolac, bupivacaine and low-dose heparin on thrombelastographic variables in vitro.","We have studied the effects of ketorolac, bupivacaine and low-dose heparin on three thrombelastographic (TEG) variables (r, alpha, MA) in vitro. Blood samples were obtained from 12 healthy volunteers and 88 ASA I-II elective surgical patients. Clinically relevant concentrations of ketorolac (4.1 micrograms ml-1) and bupivacaine (2.7 micrograms ml-1) had little or no effect on the TEG variables. However, low concentrations of heparin (0.07-0.28 u. ml-1) had marked effects on all three TEG variables. Thus the interpretation of TEG abnormalities during anaesthesia and surgery may be confounded by the presence of heparin, but not by clinical concentrations of ketorolac or bupivacaine."

CD010438,0,19524872,1,Early evaluation of acute traumatic coagulopathy by thrombelastography.,"Posttraumatic coagulopathy is a major cause of morbidity. This prospective study evaluated the thrombelastography (TEG) system and PlateletMapping (Haemoscope Corporation, Niles, Ill) values posttrauma, and it correlated those values with transfusions and fatalities. After institutional review board approval, assays were performed on 161 trauma patients. One citrated blood sample was collected onsite (OS), and 1 citrate and 1 heparinized sample were collected within 1 h of arrival to the emergency department (ED). Paired and unpaired t-testing was performed for nominal data with chi square testing for categorical values. Except for a slight increase in clot strength (maximal amplitude (MA)), there were no significant changes from OS to the ED. None of the TEG parameters were significantly different for the 22 patients who required transfusion. PlateletMapping showed lower platelet adenosine diphosphate (ADP) responsiveness in patients who needed transfusions (MA = 22.7 +/- 17.1 vs MA = 35.7 +/- 19.3, P = 0.004) and a correlation of fibrinogen <100 mg/dL with fatalities (P = 0.013). For the 14 fatalities, TEG reaction (R) time was 3703 +/- 11,618 versus 270 +/- 393 s (P = < 0.001), and MA was 46.4 +/- 22.4 versus 64.7 +/- 9.8 mm (P < 0.001). Hyperfibrinolysis (percent fibrinolysis after 60 min (LY60) >15%) was observed in 3 patients in the ED with a 67% fatality rate (P = < 0.001 by chi-square testing). PlateletMapping assays correlated with the need for blood transfusion. The abnormal TEG System parameters correlated with fatality. These coagulopathies were already evident OS. The TEG assays can assess coagulopathy, platelet dysfunction, and hyperfibrinolysis at an early stage posttrauma and suggest more effective interventions."

CD010438,0,17483274,0,Inhibition of Escherichia coli biofilm formation by self-assembled monolayers of functional alkanethiols on gold.,"Bacterial biofilms cause serious problems, such as antibiotic resistance and medical device-related infections. To further understand bacterium-surface interactions and to develop efficient control strategies, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols presenting different functional groups on gold films were analyzed to determine their resistance to biofilm formation. Escherichia coli was labeled with green florescence protein, and its biofilm formation on SAM-modified surfaces was monitored by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The three-dimensional structures of biofilms were analyzed with the COMSTAT software to obtain information about biofilm thickness and surface coverage. SAMs presenting methyl, L-gulonamide (a sugar alcohol tethered with an amide bond), and tri(ethylene glycol) (TEG) groups were tested. Among these, the TEG-terminated SAM was the most resistant to E. coli biofilm formation; e.g., it repressed biofilm formation by E. coli DH5alpha by 99.5% +/- 0.1% for 1 day compared to the biofilm formation on a bare gold surface. When surfaces were patterned with regions consisting of methyl-terminated SAMs surrounded by TEG-terminated SAMs, E. coli formed biofilms only on methyl-terminated patterns. Addition of TEG as a free molecule to growth medium at concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0% also inhibited biofilm formation, while TEG at concentrations up to 1.5% did not have any noticeable effects on cell growth. The results of this study suggest that the reduction in biofilm formation on surfaces modified with TEG-terminated SAMs is a result of multiple factors, including the solvent structure at the interface, the chemorepellent nature of TEG, and the inhibitory effect of TEG on cell motility."
CD010438,0,1606290,0,Heparin rebound phenomenon--much ado about nothing?,"Significant postoperative bleeding following open-heart surgery is often ascribed to the so-called heparin 'rebound' phenomenon and as such is treated with additional empiric doses of protamine sulphate. However, inappropriate protamine administration has been reported to be associated with acute pulmonary hypertension. The efficacy of heparin reversal was investigated in 42 patients undergoing open-heart surgery. The standard heparin bolus of 3 mg/kg body weight (4.1 IU/ml blood) administered before cardiopulmonary bypass was countered at the end of bypass using an empirical equivalent (3 mg/kg) of protamine. This regimen resulted in complete heparin neutralization (measured by the Hepcon HMS [Hemotec Inc., Englewood, CO, USA]) 15 min after protamine administration in all 42 patients, but heparin levels (0.4 IU/ml) were transiently detectable (duration less than 1 h) in six (14%) of the 42 cases 2 h later. Twenty-four hour postoperative bleeding in these patients did not differ significantly from that seen in patients who did not exhibit heparin rebound. Similarly, the thrombelastographic profiles (at 15 min and 2 h post-operation) and coagulation screen (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, activated clotting time and platelets) did not differ significantly from those of non-rebound patients. The significance, if any, of the phenomenon of heparin rebound following cardiac surgery remains to be elucidated, and, until such time, conservative administration of protamine in response to 'rebound' is recommended."
CD010438,0,9045120,0,[Anesthesiologic and intensive care requirements in liver transplantation].,"The complex anaesthesia and intensive care of liver transplantation require special instruments beside expert's knowledge. We monitorize the haemodynamics invasively during the operation and immediately afterward. In the later period of intensive care we prefer the noninvasive haemodynamic monitoring techniques. The transoesophageal echocardiography has special role in the anaesthesia of liver transplantation. One of the most important equipment during the operation is the biopump that assures the shunt between the lower and the upper body. Controlling it also belongs to the tasks of anaesthesiologist. During the anaesthesia and early period of intensive care the most serious problem can be the disfunction of blood coagulation system of the recipient. To investigate it the thrombelastography is the most suitable technique which can show the in vivo processes. To analyze the curve of the thrombelastography requires special knowledge. Similarly, the analysis of the electroencephalogram during the anaesthesia is not the everyday task of an anaesthesiologist. To reduce the blood requirements during the operation we use the autotransfusion techniques. During the anaesthesia of the liver transplantation we use other equipment that belong to the everyday work of an anaesthesiologist i.e.: rapid blood infusion and patient warming and cooling systems, rapid laboratory and blood-gas analyzing methods. The anaesthesia and intensive care of liver transplantation claim wideranging knowledge of anaesthesiologist not only theoretically but also practically."
CD010438,0,8085235,0,Assessment of hypercoagulability in patients with cancer using the Sonoclot Analyzer and thromboelastography.,"Patients with cancer have an increased incidence of thrombosis and abnormal haemostasis detectable by sophisticated laboratory tests. Whether abnormalities in such highly sensitive assays is clinically relevant to bleeding or thrombosis is not clear. The thromboelastograph (TEG) and Sonoclot analyzers assess the coagulation process in whole blood and may therefore be physiologically more relevant than assays of isolated haemostatic components. Blood was collected from healthy volunteers and patients with breast cancer, colorectal cancer or benign disease and tested in the TEG and Sonoclot. Results in the cancer group were compared to appropriately sex-matched controls. The TEG parameters R (P < 0.02), angle (P < 0.05) and MA (P < 0.001) were abnormal in colorectal cancer; up to 8/17 (47%) patients being assessed as hypercoagulable. R (P < 0.05), angle (P = 0.05) and MA (P < 0.001) were abnormal in breast cancer; 2/21 (9%) patients having abnormal results. In the Sonoclot Analyzer, 11/17 (64%) patients with colorectal cancer had a significant increase in clot rate (P < 0.001) while 2/17 had a decreased SonACT time (P = 0.05). 4/21 (19%) breast cancer patients had a significant increase in clot rate (P < 0.001) and the SonACT was shortened (P = 0.05). Platelets and fibrinogen levels were generally normal and only one patient had clinical evidence of thrombosis. There were no significant coagulation changes in patients with benign colon or breast disease. In conclusion, hypercoagulability was detected in a high proportion of breast and colorectal cancer patients by both techniques. The clot rates of the TEG and Sonoclot were significantly correlated but the latter was abnormal in a greater proportion of cancer patients."
CD010438,0,17561860,0,Preparation and characterization of human thrombin for use in a fibrin glue.,"Cryoprecipitate is frequently combined with thrombin to produce a fibrin sealant to enhance haemostasis during surgical procedures. We evaluated the thrombin produced from plasma using the Thrombin Processing Device (TPD)trade mark (Thermogenesis, Rancho Cordova, CA, USA). Plasma (250 mL) was processed in the CryoSeal FS System using the CP-3 disposable to produce cryoprecipitate by automated freezing and thawing. Simultaneously, thrombin was generated using the attached TPD. The cryoprecipitate and thrombin were harvested after approximately 50 min and then frozen and stored at -80 degrees C until analysis of total protein, fibrinogen, factor VIII (FVIII) activity, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and thrombin activity. Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) gel electrophoresis was used to compare thrombin. After combining the thrombin with cryoprecipitate, the rate of clot initiation and strength was measured using a Thromboelastograph (TEG) (Haemoscope Corp, Skokie, IL, USA). Cryoprecipitate was produced, with a fibrinogen concentration of 22 +/- 7.7 g L(-1) (20 +/- 2% recovery), FVIII activity of 14.2 +/- 4.0 IU mL(-1) and vWF of 19.9 +/- 5.2 IU mL(-1). The separate thrombin product had a concentration of 64.3 +/- 16.7 IU mL(-1) of thrombin and a total protein of 0.39 +/- 0.1 g, with SDS gel electrophoresis showing a major band at 37 kD, as did the commercial human thrombin. The TEG curves of cryoprecipitate and TPD-produced or commercial thrombin were compared. The R values (time to clot initiation) were somewhat slower with the TPD-produced thrombin, but the maximum strength (MA) of the clots was similar. In conclusion, human thrombin can be produced during automated cryoprecipitate production. This thrombin is in sufficient concentration to initiate clotting and cross-linking of fibrin from cryoprecipitate to produce an entirely autologous fibrin glue."

The inhibition of aggregation was easily demonstrable with a high concentration of collagen in the test batch and showed a striking relationship to the occurrence of thrombosis. Under heparin prophylaxis, normal coagulability was maintained.

We then simulated injury, preoperative, and operative phases. We hypothesized that this model is reproducible and useful for randomized multicenter preclinical trials. Yorkshire swine were anesthetized, intubated, and instrumented. They then underwent femur fracture, 60% total blood volume hemorrhage, a 30-min shock period, induced hypothermia to 33 degrees C, and hemorrhage volume replacement with 3:1 isotonic sodium chloride solution (NS) at each of three centers. Hemodynamic parameters were measured continuously. Thromboelastography, arterial blood gas, and laboratory values were collected at baseline, after the shock period, and after NS replacement. Thirty-seven animals were used for model development. Eight (21%) died before completion of the study period. Twenty-nine survivors were included in the analysis. MAP (+/-SEM) after the shock period was 32 +/- 2 mmHg and was similar between centers (P = 0.4). Mean pH, base deficit, and lactate levels were 7.29 +/- 0.02, 8.20 +/- 0.65 mmol/L, and 5.29 +/- 0.44 mmol/L, respectively, after NS replacement. These were similar between centers (P > 0.05). Prothrombin time values increased significantly over time at all centers, reflecting a progressive coagulopathy (P < 0.02). Thromboelastography maximum amplitude values were similar among centers (P > 0.05) and demonstrated progressively weakened platelet interaction over time (P < 0.03). Hematocrit was similar after controlled hemorrhage (P = 0.15) and dilution (P = 0.9). The pH, lactate, base deficit, and coagulation tests reflect a severely injured state. A complex porcine model of polytrauma and shock can be used for multi-institutional study with excellent reproducibility. A consistent severe injury profile was achieved, after which experimental interventions can be applied. This is the first report of a reproducible multicenter trauma and resuscitation-related animal model."

The approach was based on molecular hybridization of two classes of anticoagulants, sulfated polysaccharides and sulfated flavonoids. The synthesis was optimized using microwave-assisted sulfation with triethylamine-sulfur trioxide. The obtained polysulfated flavonosides were highly effective in increasing clotting times and able to completely block the clotting process, in contrast to their corresponding aglycones. The thromboelastography proved that polysulfated flavonosides possess good whole blood anticoagulation activity. The following structure-activity relationships were found: 3-O-rutinosides (10, 13) were direct inhibitors of FXa, while 7-O-rutinosides (7, 8) showed inhibition of FXa by ATIII activation. Furthermore, compounds 7 and 13 were stable in plasma and active in vivo and preliminary toxicity studies would lead us to rule out acute side effects. From the overall results, the polysulfated flavonosides showed the potential as new effective and safe agents for anticoagulant therapy."
CD010438,0,9869162,0,Effects of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhs-TM) on clot-induced coagulation in human plasma.,"Recent studies have suggested that clot-bound thrombin plays an important role in thrombus growth. In this study, we examined the effects of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhsTM) on clot-induced coagulation. rhsTM enhanced the activation of protein C by clots, and attenuated clot-induced thrombin generation and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) production in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of rhsTM was abolished by anti-protein C antibody. The inhibitory effect of rhsTM on clot-induced thrombin generation continued for over 60 min after the addition of the clot, while an active site-directed thrombin inhibitor, argatroban, produced a more transient inhibition. rhsTM also inhibited the regrowth of the clot in (125)I-fibrinogen-supplemented plasma. We also examined the effect of rhsTM by thromboelastography, rhsTM reduced the growth of the clot but had little effect on the time to begin clotting, while heparin and Fragmin (low molecular weight heparin) had effects opposite to those of rhsTM. These findings suggest that rhs-TM attenuates the growth of the clot by activating protein C and inhibiting further thrombin generation in the clot."

A double isotope technique (Cr-51 and In-111) was used to determine the survival of the different cell populations. Seven patients undergoing coronary artery bypass served as controls to characterize the isotopes by labeling the same population of RBCs with each radionuclide. Comparison of the data in all groups failed to show any significant difference in either the immediate or long-term survival between autotransfused (Cell Saver--processed) blood and nonprocessed RBCs. This study indicates that shed blood collected and processed at operation with the Haemonetics Cell Saver can be autotransfused and that the in vivo survival of these cells is not significantly different from the survival of nonprocessed blood.
CD010438,0,8400798,0,[Monitoring blood coagulation in larger liver operations].,"Bleeding is causally related to about 50% of postoperative deaths following liver resection. Main factors contributing to increased perioperative bleeding in liver surgery include surgical trauma, reduced activity of clotting factors and inhibitors due to impaired hepatic synthesis, low platelet count and poor platelet function as well as impaired clearance of activated clotting factors by the reticuloendothelial system of the liver (Kupffer cells). Hemostasis may be further impaired by transfusion of blood components, since citrate added for conservation is not adequately metabolized by the failing liver. Surgical bleeding leads to a loss of pro- and anticoagulatory factors as well as to activation of coagulation. Finally, hyperfibrinolysis induced by release of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA, primary hyperfibrinolysis) and disseminated coagulation (secondary hyperfibrinolysis) contribute to increased bleeding. Therefore early diagnosis and treatment of coagulation disorders is of paramount importance during liver surgery. Screening parameters of hemostasis and fibrinolysis should be available on a 24-hour basis in centers performing liver surgery. Screening for disorders of secondary hemostasis includes evaluation of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen concentration and the activity of the most important inhibitor, antithrombin III (AT III). Thrombelastography is the leading method for diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis, which can also be assessed by determination of D-dimer, fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products. Evaluation of primary hemostasis is frequently restricted to platelet count, which is only a rough parameter. In contrast, measurement of in vitro bleeding time and volume enables repeated quantification of platelet function in patients with impaired hemostasis."

CD010438,0,22266209,0,Measuring the mechanical properties of blood clots formed via the tissue factor pathway of coagulation.,"Thrombelastography (TEG) is a method that is used to conduct global assays that monitor fibrin formation and fibrinolysis and platelet aggregation in whole blood. The purpose of this study was to use a well-characterized tissue factor (Tf) reagent and contact pathway inhibitor (corn trypsin inhibitor, CTI) to develop a reproducible thrombelastography assay. In this study, blood was collected from 5 male subjects (three times). Clot formation was initiated in whole blood with 5 pM Tf in the presence of CTI, and fibrinolysis was induced by adding tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Changes in viscoelasticity were then monitored by TEG. In quality control assays, our Tf reagent, when used at 5 pM, induced coagulation in whole blood in 3.93 ± 0.23 min and in plasma in 5.12 ± 0.23 min (n=3). In TEG assays, tPA significantly decreased clot strength (maximum amplitude, MA) in all individuals but had no effect on clot time (R time). The intraassay variability (CVa<10%) for R time, angle, and MA suggests that these parameters reliably describe the dynamics of fibrin formation and degradation in whole blood. Our Tf reagent reproducibly induces coagulation, making it an ideal tool to quantify the processes that contribute to mechanical clot strength in whole blood."

Traumatic coagulopathy is frequently present early after trauma, and is associated with increased mortality. A number of recent trials suggest that viscoelastic haemostatic assays (VHA), such as thromboelastography and thromboelastometry, are useful tools in guiding transfusion. Treatment algorithms exist for the use of VHAs but are not validated in traumatic haemorrhage. In this study we examined the inter-changeability of two commonly used VHAs, TEG(®) and RoTEM(®)."

A report of 2 cases.,"Bites by boomslang are uncommon and usually occur in adult snake handlers who are aware of the potentially fatal consequences, i.e. disseminated intravascular coagulation with delayed onset of spontaneous haemorrhage. Accidental bites in children are rare. Aids to diagnosis include the description of the bite, identification of the snake, and the recognition of an abnormal bleeding tendency before the onset of spontaneous haemorrhage. Specific boomslang antivenin arrests established bleeding but may not be immediately available, in which case the administration of heparin should be considered.

CD010438,0,11006,0,The processing of human bone marrow for cryopreservation and reinfusion.,Bone marrow was aspirated from 22 patients with solid tumors. A median of 1.2 x 10(10) net bone marrow cells were obtained during a 1 hour 45 minute operative procedure. Three methods were used to concentrate the bone marrow for cryopreservation. The greatest concentration of mononuclear cells was obtained by the Haemonetics pheresis procedure. Bone marrow was cryopreserved in 10 % DMSO in volumes ranging from 150 to 700 ml. The thawed marrow was further processed to remove both DMSO and free hemoglobin prior to reinfusion. Cell clumping was observed in the first 6 of the 10 marrows thawed. Acidification of the thawed marrow to pH 6.65 was found to retard cell clumping. The immediate recovery of cells frozen was 66 % with a viability of 50 %. The mean number of viable mononuclear bone marrow cells per kilogram available for reinfusion was therefore 5.5 x 10(7).

CD010438,0,17179828,0,In-vitro efficacy of different platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists and thrombolytics on platelet/fibrin-mediated clot dynamics in human whole blood using thrombelastography.,"Suppressing platelet activation improves efficacy of thrombolytic therapy for stroke and acute myocardial infarction. Combination treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitor that binds with high affinity to platelets may therefore improve the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy. The effect of platelet GPIIb/IIIa antagonists and/or r-tPA on the dynamics of platelet/fibrin clot formation, strength, and lysis was determined using thrombelastography in human blood under thrombin or tissue factor stimulation. The study utilized platelet GPIIb/IIIa antagonists with high affinity and slow off-rate (Class I) from resting and activated platelets in comparison with Class II antagonists (lower affinity and fast off-rate from platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptors). The combination of the active form of roxifiban (XV459; Class I) or the active form of orbofiban (Class II) with a subeffective concentration of r-tPA resulted in a synergistic effect in clot lysis with roxifiban active form XV459 but not with that of orbofiban at therapeutically achievable concentrations that inhibit human platelet aggregation. These data indicate differential enhanced thrombolysis of low levels of r-tPA with high-affinity Class I but not with low-affinity Class II GPIIb/IIIa antagonists in the absence of anticoagulants."
CD010438,0,11791764,0,Leukodepletion of platelet concentrates and plasma collected with haemonetics MCS+ apheresis system. Experience of EFS-Alsace.,"The prevention of transfusion reactions and transmission of infectious diseases partly relies on the systematic removal of leukocytes from blood products. Apheresis platelets and plasma collected on the Haemonetics MCS+ collection system require filtration to obtain low levels of residual leukocytes. This filtration step is automated for platelet concentrates, whereas plasma filtration requires sterile docking of a leukoreduction filter. Our experience shows residual leukocyte levels of approximately 10(5) for platelets (the French requirements are 10(6) per unit) and 10(2) for apheresis plasma (no existing standard in France). Leukocyte residuals in platelets are highly dependent on the filtration rate, which should be as slow as possible. Whereas the current method of filtration is convenient for platelets, the connection of an in-line filter for plasma causes some organizational problems and is also associated with a loss of plasma. Haemonetics' latest development, the use of a filtering core bowl, should avoid the requirement for the connection of an additional filter for plasma filtration and will ensure continuous filtration of platelets, reducing, even further, the residual leukocyte count in platelet concentrates."
CD010438,0,9207422,0,Pilot study of HLA alloimmunization after transfusion with pre-storage leucodepleted blood products in aplastic anaemia.,"We have performed a pilot study to examine the incidence of alloimmunization using pre-storage leucocyte-depleted blood products (PLDP) in 16 previously transfused aplastic anaemia (AA) patients with no detectable HLA antibodies. A further eight AA patients with HLA antibodies received HLA-matched PLDP. Leucodepleted apheresed platelets were obtained using either Cobe spectra or Haemonetics system with an integral pall filter. Pall BPF4 filters were used for red cell preparation. Patients' sera were tested for HLA antibodies using lymphocytotoxicity (LCT). Patients who were HLA antibody negative by LCT at study entry were further tested with enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Out of 16 patients, two (12%) formed anti-HLA antibodies with a median follow-up of 9 months (range 1-15), but did not display platelet refractoriness to random donor platelets. Two patients were inadvertently transfused with non-leucodepleted blood products when later referred back to their local hospital. Both subsequently demonstrated HLA antibodies by LCT and became platelet refractory. These results contrast with a 50% incidence of HLA alloimmunization in a control group of AA patients transfused prior to this study with non-PLDP. HLA antibodies could no longer be detected by LCT in follow-up of three out of eight patients with HLA antibodies at study entry. Only one patient experienced non-haemolytic febrile transfusion reactions (NHFTR). We conclude that PLDP reduce the risk of alloimmunization even in previously transfused AA patients, PLDP are associated with a low incidence of NHFTR, and all new AA patients should receive PLDP from diagnosis."
CD010438,0,20169510,0,Inhibitors in hemophilia A: advances in elucidation of inhibitory mechanisms and in inhibitor management with bypassing agents.,"Development of inhibitory antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII (FVIII) is the most serious adverse event in replacement therapy of hemophilia A patients. The etiology and management of this condition remain major challenges for both researchers and clinicians. In the present review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which inhibitors inactivate FVIII and experimental approaches used for the mapping of inhibitor epitopes. We also present a comparative analysis of treatment of hemophilia A patients with inhibitors with currently available bypassing agents-activated prothrombin complex concentrate (FEIBA VH; Baxter Healthcare Corp., Westlake Village, CA) and recombinant activated factor VII (NovoSeven; Novo Nordisk, Princeton, NJ)-and describe some ongoing research programs aimed at developing new treatment options for these patients. Availability of sensitive and standardized laboratory assays that would assist in monitoring the effectiveness of bypass therapies is essential for designing customized treatment regimens and improvement in the management of health conditions of hemophilia patients with inhibitors."
CD010438,0,21176363,0,[Effect of rhG-CSF on blood coagulation in beagles irradiated by 2.3 Gy neutron].,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of recombinant human granulocyte stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) on blood coagulation of beagles irradiated by 2.3 Gy neutron so as to provide new therapy for blood coagulation disorder after neutron irradiation. 10 beagles were exposed to 2.3 Gy neutron, and then randomly assigned into supportive care group and rhG-CSF-treated group. The rhG-CSF-treated cohorts were injected subcutaneously with rhG-CSF (10 µg/kg·d) beginning at the day of exposure for 21 consecutive days. Peripheral blood platelet counts were examined once every two days. In vitro platelet aggregation test, thromboelastography and blood clotting tetrachoric tests were also performed. The results indicated that the blood clotting system of irradiated dogs was in hypercoagulable state in the early days after 2.3 Gy neutron irradiation, and became hypocoagulable at crisis later and were mainly on intrinsic coagulation pathway. Blood fibrinogen increased markedly during the course of disease, while platelet counts and aggregation function were decreased remarkably. rhG-CSF administered daily could correct hypercoagulable state induced by 2.3 Gy neutron irradiation at the early time post exposure, shortened the thromboplastin generation time and clotting formation, down-regulated the abnormal high fibrinogen in blood, and improved platelet aggregation function. It is concluded that rhG-CSF can improve coagulation disorders of irradiated dogs."
CD010438,0,19845078,0,Cryopreserving and deglycerolizing sickle cell trait red blood cell components using an automated cell-processing system.,"RBC components with rare phenotypes are sometimes required for patients with sickle cell disease, and these rare components can often be found among donors with sickle cell trait. Cryopreserving RBC components from sickle cell trait donors requires a modified deglycerolization method to preserve the integrity of the RBCs. This study evaluated the feasibility of using an automated cell-processing system to cryopreserve and deglycerolize sickle cell trait donor RBC components. CP2D/AS-3 RBC components were collected from three donors with sickle cell trait. Each component was processed with an automated cell-processing system (ACP 215, Haemonetics Corp., Braintree, MA) and cryopreserved within 6 days of collection. The components were stored at -65 degrees C or less for at least 2 days and were deglycerolized using the automated cell-processing system's standard procedure. Before cryopreservation and after deglycerolization, several variables were measured. Deglycerolization resulted in recovery of 43.0, 76.5, and 67.5 percent of RBCs from the three sickle-cell-trait donor components compared with 80 percent or greater for all six control components. A small, dark red, jelly-like mass was noted in the bowl of the disposable set after deglycerolization of each of the three RBC sickle cell trait components. The osmolalities of all three sickle cell trait components were less than 400 mOsm/kg, but only one of the three was acceptable for a 14-day outdate. Freezing and deglycerolization of sickle cell trait donor RBC components with the automated cell-processing system resulted in recovery of some RBCs, but a decrease in RBC recovery was problematic. Modifications of the procedure are needed for processing sickle cell trait donor RBC components."

CD010438,0,17179823,0,Quantification of the effects of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor and alpha2-antiplasmin on fibrinolysis in normal human plasma.,"Two major proteins that inhibit fibrinolysis include thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) and alpha2-antiplasmin. Our goal was to quantify the contribution of TAFI and alpha2-antiplasmin to antifibrinolytic defenses with thrombelastography. Plasma activated with tissue factor/kaolin was subjected to fibrinolysis with tissue-type plasminogen activator (100 U/ml). Prior to activation, TAFI activity was inhibited with either potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (25 microg/ml) or an anti-TAFI antibody, and alpha2-antiplasmin activity was inhibited with an anti-alpha2-antiplasmin antibody. Data were collected for 30 min, with the time of onset and rate of fibrinolysis determined. Compared with uninhibited samples, TAFI inhibition significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the time of onset of fibrinolysis by 70% and increased the rate of lysis by 70%. There was no difference between potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor and anti-TAFI antibody inhibition. Inhibition of alpha2-antiplasmin resulted in a significantly (P < 0.05) decreased time of onset (85%) and increased the rate of lysis (557%) compared with uninhibited samples. Inhibition of alpha2-antiplasmin activity resulted in a significantly (P < 0.05) greater fibrinolytic response than TAFI inhibition. In conclusion, utilization of standard inhibitors and thrombelastography permitted quantification of the effects of TAFI and alpha2-antiplasmin on fibrinolysis in plasma. Future investigation of diseases involving hypofibrinolysis (e.g. left ventricular assist devices) could be conducted using this assay system."
CD010438,0,17179824,0,Epsilon-aminocaproic acid inhibition of fibrinolysis in vitro: should the 'therapeutic' concentration be reconsidered?,"The therapeutic concentration of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) has been 130 microg/ml or greater for nearly 50 years. We tested the effects on clot growth/disintegration of EACA with a plasmatic model of hyperfibrinolysis in vitro. Human plasma was exposed to 1000 U/ml tissue-type plasminogen activator containing 0, 13, 65 or 130 microg/ml EACA, with clot growth/disintegration kinetics quantified via thrombelastography. Data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance as appropriate. Exposure of plasma to 1000 U/ml tissue-type plasminogen activator resulted in a brief-lived clot, lasting 2 min. EACA at all concentrations tested significantly increased the rate of clot growth compared with samples with 0 microg/ml EACA. Clot strength was significantly increased by EACA in a concentration-dependent fashion. Similarly, EACA significantly prolonged the time of onset of clot lysis and decreased the rate of lysis. Samples with 130 microg/ml EACA had no sign of lysis present for 30 min. Subtherapeutic to therapeutic concentrations of EACA significantly attenuated or abolished fibrinolysis in the presence of a concentration of tissue-type plasminogen activator more than 2000-fold that encountered systemically during cardiopulmonary bypass. Further clinical investigation is warranted to determine whether smaller concentrations of EACA could provide a reduction in bleeding with a concomitant decrease in thrombotic complications."
CD010438,0,17179827,0,Hydroxyethyl starch enhances argatroban-mediated decreases in clot propagation and strength by diminishing thrombin-fibrinogen interactions.,"Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) have been administered for anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass for patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. While DTIs prolonged clot initiation and decreased clot propagation, clot strength did not change. Hydroxyethyl starches (HES), however, significantly decreased clot propagation and strength. We hypothesized that DTI with HES could significantly decrease hemostasis more than DTI alone. Plasma was exposed to 0 or 5 microg/ml argatroban with 0 or 30% dilution with 0.9% NaCl, 10% pentastarch or 6% Voluven. Additional argatroban-exposed samples diluted with HES had addition of alpha-thrombin (0.25 U/ml) and fibrinogen (150 mg/ml). Clot kinetics were determined via thrombelastography. While dilution with 0.9% NaCl significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the clot strength by 17% compared with samples only exposed to argatroban, dilution with pentastarch and Voluven significantly (P < 0.05) markedly decreased clot strength (53 and 78%, respectively). Voluven dilution significantly increased the time to clot initiation and decreased the velocity of clot propagation compared with samples only exposed to argatroban. Addition of alpha-thrombin/fibrinogen restored clot strength. DTI/HES administration diminished hemostasis to a greater extent than DTI exposure alone. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether this therapeutic approach can improve the safety of anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia."
CD010438,0,17179826,0,Thrombelastographic measures of clot propagation: a comparison of alpha with the maximum rate of thrombus generation.,"The alpha angle alpha (degrees) is a thrombelastographic measure of clot propagation. A parametric measurement of clot propagation [maximum rate of thrombus generation (MRTG), dynes/cm2 per s], however, has recently been utilized. Thus, the relationship of changes in alpha with changes in MRTG were determined. alpha and MRTG values obtained from 859 thrombelastograms was collected from nine studies. Data were analyzed and the relationship between alpha and MRTG defined with commercially available software. Additional comparisons were made retrospectively from whole-blood and plasma data obtained from 33 normal individuals. Data from the nine studies demonstrated that MRTG increased in an exponential fashion compared with increases in alpha (R2 = 0.88, P < 0.001). Whole-blood alpha values were in the range 66.7-74.7 whereas MRTG values were 5.5-10.8, and plasma alpha values were 65.1-77.9 with corresponding MRTG values of 3.5-12.0. Assessment of clot propagation utilizing MRTG provides a more parametric evaluation than the determination of alpha. While normal alpha values may vary by only 12-20%, MRTG values vary by approximately 200-300%. The MRTG should be progressively utilized to a greater extent in both laboratory and clinical settings to parametrically quantify clot growth kinetics with thrombelastography."
CD010438,0,20739876,0,Clot formation in canine whole blood as measured by rotational thromboelastometry is influenced by sample handling and coagulation activator.,"The objective of the present study was to systematically evaluate the impact of methodology on thromboelastometry with canine whole blood. Thromboelastometry was performed on citrated blood using a variety of combinations of clotting activators [ex-tem (tissue factor or TF), in-tem (ellagic acid), diluted TF from Innovin, or Ca (recalcification only)] and storage times. Thromboelastometry was also performed using diluted TF from Innovin on blood collected into a contact inhibitor. Ex-vivo contact activation was compared between canine and human blood. Clotting activator had a marked impact on coagulation time, a minor impact on alpha angle, and no impact on clot formation time or maximum clot firmness. When ex-tem or in-tem was the clotting activator, sample storage up to 30 min did not affect results. With diluted TF from Innovin or Ca, sample storage was associated with the development of increased coagulability (as indicated by shorter coagulation time and clot formation time and higher alpha angle) due to ex-vivo contact activation. Canine blood underwent markedly more ex-vivo contact activation than did human blood. Canine blood undergoes significant ex-vivo contact activation during and after collection, which influences thromboelastometry results when a weak clotting activator (such as low TF or recalcification) is used. Thromboelastometry with a strong activator (such as ex-tem or in-tem) is less influenced by ex-vivo changes, and, therefore, likely to be more reflective of in-vivo hemostatic capabilities and to provide consistently interpretable and comparable results."
CD010438,0,22234563,0,Abnormal inflammation leads to maternal coagulopathies associated with placental haemostatic alterations in a rat model of foetal loss.,"Spontaneous pregnancy loss is often associated with aberrant maternal inflammation and systemic coagulopathies. However, the role of inflammation in the development of obstetric coagulopathies is poorly understood. Further, questions remain as to whether systemic coagulopathies are linked to placental haemostatic alterations, and whether these local alterations contribute to a negative foetal outcome. Using a model of spontaneous foetal loss in which pregnant rats are given a single injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we characterised the systemic maternal coagulation status following LPS administration using thromboelastography (TEG), a global haemostatic assay that measures the kinetics of clot formation. Systemic maternal coagulopathy was evident in 82% of LPS-treated rats. Specifically, we observed stage-I, -II, and -III disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hypercoagulability. Modulation of inflammation through inhibition of tumour necrosis factor α with etanercept resulted in a 62% reduction in the proportion of rats exhibiting coagulopathy. Moreover, inflammation-induced systemic coagulopathies were associated with placental haemostatic alterations, which included increased intravascular, decidual, and labyrinth fibrin deposition in cases of DIC-I and hypercoagulability, and an almost complete absence of fibrin deposition in cases of DIC-III. Furthermore, systemic and placental haemostatic alterations were associated with impaired utero-placental haemodynamics, and inhibition of these haemostatic alterations by etanercept was associated with maintenance of utero-placental haemodynamics. These findings indicate that modulation of maternal inflammation may be useful in the prevention of coagulopathies associated with complications of pregnancy."
CD010438,0,8904330,0,Cell saver efficacy for routine coronary artery bypass surgery.,"A retrospective study was conducted to determine the effect of intraoperative Haemonetics Cell Saver (HCS) usage on postoperative homologous blood product requirements in CABG patients. From 1 January to 31 December 1993, 516 patients without renal disease or postoperative surgical or gastrointestinal haemorrhage had elective, first-time CABG surgery. The HCS was utilized in 435 of these patients (Group CS) and in 81 patients the HCS was excluded (Group NCS). Preoperative patient variables were similar in the group. We evaluated the HCS effect on blood product transfusion by comparing -x units of red blood cells (RBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets (PLTS) transfused per patient between groups CS and NCS. There were no differences in the -x units of RBC (1.9 +/- 2.7 CS vs. 1.8 +/- 1.5 NCS) or in the RBC transfusion rate (48% CS vs 50% NCS). There were also no significant differences between the groups in -x units of FFP (0.9 +/- 0.8 CS vs 0.4 +/- 0.9 NCS) or PLTS (0.7 +/- 3.1 CS vs 0.4 +/- 2.5 NCS), or in the percentage of patients receiving these products (12% CS vs 8% NCS). These data provide no evidence that the use of the HCS decreases the amount of homologous blood bank products required postoperatively in patients having routine first-time CABG surgery. The current era of aggressive blood conservation may have limited the role of the HCS in routine CABG surgery."

CD010438,0,11256126,0,[Microbiological contamination of intraoperatively collected erythrocyte concentrate in mechanical autotransfusion in tumor surgery].,"Intraoperative autotransfusion is an effective method of the autologous haemotherapy. Gamma irradiation of the salvaged erythrocyte concentrates leads to inactivation of malignant cells and allows retransfusion in oncologic surgery. The risk of microbiological contamination of the autologous blood product has not been systematically studied in this field of surgery. During the evaluation of intraoperative autotransfusion in oncologic surgery at the University Hospital of Leipzig, the salvaged blood of 46 patients who underwent tumour surgery (urology, gynaecology and neurosurgery) was processed to a washed erythrocyte concentrate with a Cell Saver 5 or a Haemolite 2 (Haemonetics). Specimens for microbiological studies were taken from the area of surgery, the reservoir bottle of the autotransfusion system and the salvaged erythrocyte concentrates. The investigation with plate cultures and the identification of microorganisms were performed according to standard procedures of microbiological diagnosis. The ethics committee of the University Hospital of Leipzig approved the study protocol. We found a microbiological contamination in 10 of 46 salvaged erythrocyte concentrates (22%), above all the growth of saprophytes (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and Neisseria species). We also identified bacteria which have their habitats in the intestinal tract (E. coli and Enterococcus). The highest rate of microbial contaminated erythrocyte concentrates was found in urologic oncosurgery (37%). In neurosurgery (laminectomy and craniotomy including tumour extirpation), there was no bacterial growth in the salvaged erythrocyte concentrate. Intraoperative autotransfusion should be avoided during surgery touching the urinary tract, e.g. prostatectomy and cystectomy. In neurosurgery, it seems to be safe as far as microbiological contamination is concerned. To assess the real risk of microbiological contamination of the salvaged erythrocytes, more investigations are necessary to determine not only the extent and nature of contamination but also the clinical effects."
CD010438,0,2946093,0,In vitro comparison of fibrinolytic activity of plasminogen activators using a thrombelastographic method: in vivo evaluation of the B-chain-streptokinase complex in the dog model using pre-titered doses.,"Thrombelastography was used to quantitatively compare the clot-lysing efficiency of 6 different plasminogen activators, using human whole blood, pooled normal plasma, and platelet rich plasma. The activators compared were the B-chain-streptokinase complex, the plasmin-streptokinase complex, the mini-plasminogen-streptokinase complex, tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, and urokinase. The most efficient activator found was the B-chain-streptokinase complex. This complex was 4.0 times more effective than streptokinase, 3.0 times more effective than the plasmin-streptokinase complex, 1.3 times more effective than the mini-plasminogen-streptokinase complex, 2.3 times more effective than tissue plasminogen activator, and 16.0 times more effective than urokinase. Although there were differences in both the coagulation and fibrinolysis thrombelastographic patterns between plasma and whole blood, the comparative efficiencies of each activator were the same with either plasma or blood. The B-chain-streptokinase complex was evaluated as a thrombolytic agent in clot-lysis experiments in the jugular vein in the dog model, using a thrombelastographic method to determine the minimum dose of activator necessary for clot-lysis. With 6 dogs infused locally with 0.25 mg (8000 I.U.) of the plasmin-streptokinase complex, the cumulative clot-lysis was 18.0 +/- 3.0% with the first dose, 33.0 +/- 2.1% with the second dose, and 55.2 +/- 8.6% with the third dose. With 6 dogs infused locally with 0.03 mg (2000 I.U.) of the B-chain-streptokinase complex, the cumulative clot-lysis was 30.6 +/- 6.4% with the first dose, 54.4 +/- 9.6% with the second dose, and 80.2 +/- 9.0% with the third dose."

Sixty-five patients scheduled for coronary surgery were randomized into 3 groups: group A--conventional coronary artery bypass grafting, group B--off-pump surgery, and group C--coronary artery bypass grafting with modified, rheoparin coated cardiopulmonary bypass with the avoidance of reinfusion of cardiotomy blood into the circuit. The sampling time points for rotation thromboelastographic evaluations were as follows: preoperatively, 15 minutes after sternotomy, on the completion of peripheral bypass anastomoses, at the end of the procedures, and 24 hours after the end of surgery. D-dimer levels were evaluated before surgery, at the end of procedures, and 24 hours after surgery. Thromboelastographic signs of fibrinolysis (evaluated by Lysis Onset Time-intergroup differences at 60 and 150 minutes of assessment: P = 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively) were clearly detectable during cardiopulmonary bypass in group A, but not at any time in groups B and C. At the other sampling times all thromboelastographic parameters were similar in all groups. In group A, no exceptional bleeding tendency (during 24 hours), as compared to groups B and C (geometric means and 95% confidence intervals: group A: 686.7 [570.8; 826.1] mL, group B: 555.3 [441.3; 698.9] mL, group C: 775.6 [645.1; 932.3] mL, P = 0.157), and no significant correlations between Lysis Onset Time, postoperative blood loss, and D-dimer levels were found. No significant differences in postoperative blood loss related to cardiac surgeons and assistant surgeons were detected. Thromboelastographic signs of increased fibrinolysis were detectable in the important proportion of coronary surgery patients operated on with the use of conventional cardio-pulmonary bypass, but not in off-pump patients and those operated on with the biocompatible surface-modified circuit without reinfusion of cardiotomy suction blood. These signs resolved spontaneously at the end of surgery and were not associated with increased postoperative bleeding. No significant correlation with D-dimer levels was found."
CD010438,0,20400026,0,The acute coagulopathy of trauma shock: clinical relevance.,"Recent observational studies have identified an acute coagulopathy in trauma victims that is present on arrival in the emergency room. It has been associated with a four-fold increase in mortality and increased incidence of organ failure. Conventional trauma resuscitation and transfusion protocols are designed for dilutional coagulopathy and appear inadequate in the management of acute traumatic coagulopathy and massive transfusion. Acute Coagulopathy of Trauma Shock (ACoTS) is caused by a combination of tissue injury and shock, and may occur without significant fluid administration, clotting factor depletion or hypothermia. The mechanism through which acute coagulopathy develops is unclear but activation of the protein C pathway has been implicated. Standard coagulation tests do not identify cases in a timely fashion and ACoTS should be suspected in any trauma patient with a significant magnitude of injury and shock, as evidenced by an abnormal admission base deficit on blood gas. Development of point of care coagulometers and whole blood coagulation analysers, such as rotational thromboelastometry, may enable earlier laboratory identification of this group. Retrospective studies performed by the American military indicate that resuscitation of severely injured patients with higher ratios of plasma given early may improve outcome and reduce overall blood product use. The place of adjunctive pharmaceutical agents within this strategy remains unclear. There is an acute coagulopathy associated with trauma and shock that is an independent predictor of outcomes. Delineation of this entity, with directed management protocols should lead to a reduction in avoidable deaths from haemorrhage after trauma."

CD010438,0,21732671,0,Polysulfated xanthones: multipathway development of a new generation of dual anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents.,"A multipathway strategy was used to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antithrombotic effects of a new synthetic family of sulfated small molecules. Polysulfated xanthonosides showed highly effective anticoagulation effects in vitro, both in plasma (clotting times) and in whole human blood (thromboelastography), as well as in vivo (ip administration, mice). Physicochemical properties were assessed for mangiferin heptasulfate (7), which showed high solubility and stability in water and in human plasma and no putative hepatotoxicity in vivo. Mangiferin heptasulfate (7) was found to be a direct inhibitor of FXa, while persulfated 3,6-(O-β-glucopyranosyl)xanthone (13) acted as a dual inhibitor of FXa (directly and by antithrombin III activation). By impedance aggregometry, compounds 7 and 13 exhibited the antiplatelet effect by inhibition of both arachidonic acid and ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Dual anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents, such as sulfated xanthonosides 7 and 13, are expected to lead to a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of both venous and arterial thrombosis."

CD010438,0,19085759,0,The history of phenotypic testing in thrombosis and hemostasis.,"This article takes the reader through a journey of the history of the phenotypic tests for hemostasis and thrombosis starting from the most simple (which were based on the visual inspection and recording of the time needed for native whole blood to clot) to the more complex ones based on the addition to plasma of exogenous substances, use of sophisticated coagulometers or synthetic substrates, and use of computer software to record coagulation times or visualize coagulation tracings and thrombin generation curves. One can see how the simple tests evolved over the years and how such old and time-honored tests as thrombin generation and thromboelastography, devised more than 50 years ago and neglected for many years, are now gaining momentum thanks to the progress made by the technology combined with a better understanding of the coagulation mechanisms. This progress notwithstanding, it should be realized that current tests are still somewhat far from being adequate to investigate hemostasis and thrombosis. The challenge in the future will be to devise newer tests mimicking more closely what occurs in vivo."

CD010438,0,3041874,0,[Hemodynamics in donor plasmapheresis].,"Several studies have demonstrated that preoperative withdrawal and storage of autologous plasma as fresh frozen plasma is effective in blood conservation. For that purpose patients with elective surgery (orthopaedic surgery, open heart surgery, neurosurgery and others) have to undergo donor plasmapheresis without staying in the hospital. Depending upon the need the procedure can be performed several times preoperatively, taking about 900 ml in a normal weighting subject at once. The collection of autologous plasma should be finished at least 14 days before surgery. In order to investigate the haemodynamic effects of donor plasmapheresis 30 patients scheduled for coronary bypass surgery were devided into two groups. 15 patients underwent plasmapheresis (10 ml plasma/kgbw) by one-needle-technique using a Haemonetics seperator (PCS) after premedication but before onset of anaesthesia. Blood withdrawal was performed with 0.5 ml/kgbw x min. Another 15 patients, serving as control had no plasma withdrawal and were measured at identical times as the other group. Both groups had an identical fluid replacement with 500 ml Ringer's solution during the investigation period. Plasma withdrawn was not substituted by colloidal solution (simulating the situation when plasmapheresis is performed at the outpatient). Haemodynamic measurements (both groups) included heart rate, arterial blood pressure, right- and left-atrial pressure, systemic- and pulmonary-vascular resistance and cardiac output. There were no relevant effects of plasmapheresis on haemodynamic function during and after the investigation period in that patients: neither heart rate, blood pressure or vascular resistance changed significantly nor did pre- and afterload or cardiac index. No differences to the group without plasmapheresis could be observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010438,0,935639,0,In vitro testing of surface thrombogenicity using the thrombelastograph.,Synthetic surfaces can be assessed for their ability to promote or inhibit whole blood coagulation with improved accuracy using a new protocol developed for the Thrombelastograph instrument. Results obtained from the analysis of the hydrodynamic state of blood clotting in Thrombelastograph chambers have enabled a quantitative interpretation of the output of this instrument to be made. The thrombogenic properties of a segmented polyurethane and a polydimethyl siloxane are compared with a preparation of reconstituted elastin. It is seen that a four-fold delay in clotting time is exhibited by reconstituted elastin when it is compared with other biomedical synthetic materials tested.
CD010438,0,9560544,0,[The effect of scalp infiltration with bupivacaine on blood coagulability and fibrinolysis in neurovascular surgery].,"We investigated the effect of scalp infiltration with bupivacaine on blood coagulability and fibrinolysis in neurovascular surgery. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: scalp infiltration group (who received scalp infiltration with 0.5% bupivacaine prior to surgical incision, n = 7) and control group (n = 6). The blood coagulability and fibrinolysis were measured before and after surgical incision using a thromboelastogram (Thromboelastograph C-3000, Haemoscope). In the control group, the reaction and coagulation times were significantly shortened (30% and 23%, respectively, P < 0.05) and the maximum amplitude, which reflects coagulability, increased significantly (21%, P < 0.01) compared to each presurgical value. The scalp infiltration prior to the surgical incision prevented these reactions (P < 0.05). The fibrinolytic rate did not change in either group. We conclude that scalp infiltration prior to surgical incision is beneficial for attenuating an increase in blood coagulability, which could induce perioperative complications due to associated systemic diseases (i.e. hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, etc.)."
CD010438,0,9336445,0,Triplex formation at physiological pH: comparative studies on DNA triplexes containing 5-Me-dC tethered at N4 with spermine and tetraethyleneoxyamine.,"Oligodeoxynucleotides with spermine conjugation at C4 of 5-Me-dC ( sp -ODN) exhibit triple helix formation with complementary Watson-Crick duplexes, and were optimally stable at physiological pH 7.3 and low salt concentration. This was attributed to a favored reassociation of the polycationic third strand with the anionic DNA duplex. To gain further insights into the factors that contribute to the enhancement of triplex stability and for engineering improved triplex systems, the spermine appendage at C4 of 5-Me-dC was replaced with 1,11-diamino-3,6,9-trioxaundecane to create teg -ODNs. From the triple helix forming abilities of these modified ODNs studied by hysteresis behaviour and the effect of salts on triplex stability, it is demonstrated here that teg- ODNs stabilise triplexes through hydrophobic desolvation while sp -ODNs stabilise triplexes by charge effects. The results imply that factors in addition to base stacking effects and interstrand hydrogen bonds are significantly involved in modulation of triplex stability by base modified oligonucleotides."

CD010438,0,12709915,0,Hemostasis during normal pregnancy and puerperium.,"During normal pregnancy the hemostatic balance changes in the direction of hypercoagulability, thus decreasing bleeding complications in connection with delivery. The most important initial factor for acute hemostasis at delivery is, however, uterine muscle contractions, which interrupt blood flow. Global tests such as Sonoclot signature, the Thromboelastogram, and a new method analyzing overall plasma hemostasis, all show changes representative of hypercoagulability during pregnancy. Increased endogenous thrombin generation, acquired activated protein C resistance, slightly decreased activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and increased prothrombin complex level (PT) measured as international normalized ratio (INR) of less than 0.9 have been reported as well. In normal pregnancy, the platelet count is within normal range except during the third trimester when benign gestational thrombocytopenia, 80 to 150 x 10 9/L, can be observed. Platelet turnover is usually normal. Activation of platelets and release of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 are reported. The bleeding time is unchanged during normal pregnancy. Most blood coagulation factors and fibrinogen increase during pregnancy. Factor (F) XI is the only blood coagulation factor that decreases. Blood coagulation inhibitors are mainly unchanged but the level of free protein S decreases markedly and the level of tissue factor pathway inhibitor increases. Thrombomodulin levels increase during pregnancy. Fibrinolytic capacity is diminished during pregnancy, mainly because of markedly increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) from endothelial cells and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) from the placenta. Thrombin-activated fibrinolysis inhibitor is reported to be unaffected. The total hemostatic balance has been studied by analyses of prothrombin fragment 1+2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, fibrinopeptide A, soluble fibrin, D-dimer, and plasmin-antiplasmin complex. There is activation of blood coagulation and a simultaneous increase in fibrinolysis without signs of organ dysfunction during normal pregnancy. These changes increase as pregnancy progresses. During delivery, there is consumption of platelets and blood coagulation factors, including fibrinogen. Fibrinolysis improves and increases fast following childbirth and expulsion of the placenta, resulting in increased D-dimer levels. These changes are self-limiting at normal delivery. The hemostatic changes, noted during pregnancy, normalize after delivery within 4 to 6 weeks. Platelet count and free protein S, however, can be abnormal longer. Hemostasis should not be tested earlier than 3 months following delivery and after terminating lactation to rule out influences of pregnancy. PAI-1 and PAI-2 levels decrease fast postpartum, but PAI 2 has been detected up to 8 weeks postpartum. alpha 2 -antiplasmin, urokinase, and kallikrein inhibitor levels have been reported to be increased 6 weeks postpartum."

CD010438,0,17897274,0,Sequential clot strength analyses following diclofenac in pediatric adenotonsillectomy.,Tonsillectomy is a common pediatric surgical procedure resulting in significant postoperative pain. There is ongoing controversy as to the most satisfactory analgesic regimen. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are an alternative to opioids in this setting. NSAID use in tonsillectomy has been shown to be opioid sparing in the recovery period and to have similar analgesic effects to opioids in pediatric patients. Because of their nonspecific action on the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase there is potential for increased bleeding which has led many practitioners to avoid NSAIDs completely in this patient population potentially resulting in suboptimal pain control. Our aim in this study was to assess the effect of preoperatively administered diclofenac on the blood clot strength in children undergoing (adeno-) tonsillectomy.

Three sham-infected pigs served as controls. Blood samples were taken for bacteriology, haematology and clinical chemistry. A necropsy was carried out and tissue samples were collected for bacteriology and histology. The onset of clinical disease was seen at 7-8 h after inoculation. The blood bacterial counts remained low throughout the study. All infected pigs developed sepsis characterized by fever, neutrophilia, increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6, and decreased levels of serum iron. The CRP and IL-6 levels peaked at 36 h, whereas IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha showed no obvious changes. Thromboelastography showed increasing hypercoagulability from 12 h and onwards, whereas the platelet numbers declined slightly throughout the experiment. The levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin were elevated at 24 and 36 h. In conclusion, sepsis and severe sepsis were induced as evidenced by dysfunction of the blood clotting system and the liver."

CD010438,0,20431856,0,In vitro factor XIII supplementation increases clot firmness in Rotation Thromboelastometry (ROTEM).,"Factor XIII (F XIII) is an essential parameter for final clot stability. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the addition of factor (F)XIII on clot stability as assessed by Rotation Thromboelastometry (ROTEM). In 90 intensive care patients ROTEM measurements were performed after in vitro addition of F XIII 0.32 IU, 0.63 IU, 1.25 IU and compared to diluent controls (DC; aqua injectabile) resulting in approximate F XIII concentrations of 150, 300 and 600%. Baseline measurements without any additions were also performed. The following ROTEM parameters were measured in FIBTEM and EXTEM tests: clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), maximum clot firmness (MCF), maximum lysis (ML), maximum clot elasticity (MCE) and alpha-angle (alphaA). Additionally, laboratory values for FXIII, fibrinogen (FBG), platelets and haematocrit were contemporaneously determined. In the perioperative patient population mean FBG concentration was elevated at 5.2 g/l and mean FXIII concentration was low at 62%. The addition of FXIII led to a FBG concentration-dependent increase in MCF both in FIBTEM and EXTEM. Mean increases in MCF (FXIII vs. DC) of approximately 7 mm and 6 mm were observed in FIBTEM and EXTEM, respectively. F XIII addition also led to decreased CFT, increased alphaA, and reduced ML in FIBTEM and EXTEM. In vitro supplementation of FXIII to supraphysiologic levels increases maximum clot firmness, accelerates clot formation and increases clot stability in EXTEM and FIBTEM as assayed by ROTEM in perioperative patients with high fibrinogen and low FXIII levels."
CD010438,0,1772995,0,Coagulation disorder during liver transplantation.,"Detailed haemostatic changes were investigated during eight liver transplantations. The patients were divided into two groups; group 1 had minor operative bleeding (four cases) and group 2 had major bleeding (four cases). Group 2 had lower levels of platelets, fibrinogen, factor V (FV), and alpha 2-antiplasmin than group 1, and the thromboelastography showed fibrinolysis. In both groups, plasma tissue-plasminogen activator levels rose slightly. After revascularization of the graft liver, reductions in the values of PT, fibrinogen, FV and FVII were noted, along with a prolongation of the PTT and an increase in thrombin-antithrombin III complex levels. Plasma levels of protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, and plasminogen remained relatively stable throughout the operation. These results show that the preceding fibrinolysis and subsequent superimposed activation of the clotting system are the main causes of coagulopathy during liver transplantation, which correlate with the amount of operative haemorrhage and the abnormalities found in haemostatic tests."
CD010438,0,20798588,0,Effects of electrochemical reduction reactions on the biodegradation of recalcitrant organic compounds (ROCs) and bacterial community diversity.,"Five bacterial species, capable of degrading the recalcitrant organic compounds (ROCs) diethyleneglycol monomethylether (DGMME), 1-amino-2-propanol (APOL), 1-methyl-2- pyrrolidinone (NMP), diethyleneglycol monoethylether (DGMEE), tetraethyleneglycol (TEG), and tetrahydrothiophene 1,1-dioxide (sulfolane), were isolated from an enrichment culture. Cupriavidus sp. catabolized 93.5+/-1.7 mg/l of TEG, 99.3+/-1.2 mg/l of DGMME, 96.1+/-1.6mg/l of APOL, and 99.5+/-0.5mg/l of NMP in 3 days. Acineobacter sp. catabolized 100 mg/l of DGMME, 99.9+/-0.1 mg/l of NMP, and 100 mg/l of DGMEE in 3 days. Pseudomonas sp.3 catabolized 95.7+/-1.2 mg/l of APOL and 99.8+/-0.3 mg/l of NMP. Paracoccus sp. catabolized 98.3+/-0.6 mg/l of DGMME and 98.3+/-1.0 mg/l of DGMEE in 3 days. A maximum 43+/-2.0 mg/l of sulfolane was catabolized by Paracoccus sp. in 3 days. When a mixed culture composed of the five bacterial species was applied to real wastewater containing DGMME, APOL, NMP, DGMEE, or TEG, 92~99% of each individual ROC was catabolized within 3 days. However, at least 9 days were required for the complete mineralization of sulfolane. Bacterial community diversity, analyzed on the basis of the TGGE pattern of 16S rDNA extracted from viable cells, was found to be significantly reduced in a conventional bioreactor after 6 days of incubation. However, biodiversity was maintained after 12 days of incubation in an electrochemical bioreactor. In conclusion, the electrochemical reduction reaction enhanced the diversity of the bacterial community and actively catabolized sulfolane."

As a consequence of the presence of joint sealings containing PCB, total PCB concentrations in indoor air up to 4,200 ng/m3 were detected (data based on a survey including 29 sampling sites). In a PCB contaminated industrial building, total indoor air PCB levels up to 13,000 ng/m3 were measured. Typical PCB congeners in indoor air include PCB 28, PCB 52, and PCB 101. Concentrations of coplanar (dioxin-like) PCB have been determined for six different sites. The most abundant coplanar PCB congener in indoor air is PCB 118, followed by PCB 105, PCB 123, and PCB 77 in various order. Levels of coplanar PCB, expressed as toxicity equivalents (TEG), do correlate well with the total indoor air PCB concentration: a total PCB level of 1,000 ng/m3 corresponds to a concentration of coplanar PCB of 1.2 pg TEQ/m3. Based on this correlation and on an indoor air PCB level of 6,000 ng/m3 (tentative guideline value for PCB in indoor air in Switzerland based on a daily exposure of 8 h), the maximum daily intake of coplanar PCB via indoor air was estimated to be 0.6 pg TEQ/kg body weight."

Venous blood from 12 healthy volunteers was diluted by 20% and 40% with a combination of an equal amount of colloid (balanced or unbalanced 6% HES 130/0.4, or 4% gelatin) and crystalloid (balanced or unbalanced Ringer's acetate). Blood samples were analyzed with rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®). The initiation of coagulation was delayed in all dilutions except for the 20 vol% gelatin-dilution. In the extrinsic activation test, maximum clot firmness was decreased and clot formation time prolonged after 40 vol% hemodilution with a balanced Ringer's/unbalanced HES combination, more than in the corresponding gelatin hemodilution. In the fibrin-based test, after both 20- and 40 vol% hemodilution with unbalanced Ringer's/gelatin solution, maximum clot firmness was significantly stronger than in the Ringer's/HES-combinations. The combination of balanced colloid and crystalloid has similar coagulation effects in vitro as their respective combination of unbalanced solutions."

Recently we reported the synthesis and characterization of very high molecular weight (Mn up to 700,000) and narrowly polydispersed polyglycerols which could be potentially used as alternatives to high generation dendrimers which are difficult to make. A detailed biocompatibility testing of these polymers conducted in vitro is reported here. The in vitro studies include hemocompatibility testing for effects on coagulation (prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), plasma recalcification time (PRT), thrombelastograph parameters (TEG)), complement activation, platelet activation, red blood cell aggregation and cytotoxicity. Results from these studies show that these high molecular weight polyglycerols are highly biocompatible and are potential candidates for various applications in nanobiotechnology and in nanomedicine.

Thrombelastography (TEG) enables global assessment of the hemostatic function. The present study tested for the first time the specificity and sensitivity of the rotation thrombelastography (ROTEG: rotation thrombelastography) method for the influence of FXIII and the FXIIIVal34Leu polymorphism on thrombelastograms measured in citrated plasma. Three thrombelastographic parameters were determined in (a) citrated pool plasma, (b) FXIII-deficient plasma, (c) different mixtures of both, and (d) in 60 plasma samples genotyped for FXIIIVal34Leu. Thrombelastograms from FXIII-deficient plasma were significantly smaller than those from pool plasma (8 mm vs. 20.9 mm). Increasing amounts of pool plasma added to FXIII-deficient plasma led to an increase in maximum clot firmness (MCF). FXIIIVal34Leu showed an influence on clot formation time (CFT) values, which decreased with increasing number of Leu alleles. The difference between the wild type and the homozygote mutant genotype was statistically significant (median 185.3 vs. 86.0 s, P=.031). ROTEG is a simple but effective method for the investigation of FXIII function in plasma. The ROTEG method has shown to be not only specific for the FXIII influence, as effects exclusively dependent on FXIII could be observed, but also sensitive, as already smallest amounts of FXIII could be detected. Additionally, the impact of a common genetic polymorphism on ROTEG could be shown for the first time."

CD010438,0,22577913,0,In vitro thrombotic tendency of reactive thrombocytosis in critically ill patients: a prospective case-control study.,"It is uncertain whether reactive thrombocytosis is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. This prospective case-control study assessed the in vitro thrombotic tendency of patients with reactive thrombocytosis. Forty-eight patients with reactive thrombocytosis, defined by platelet count >500x10(9)/l and 55 similar, randomly selected critically ill patients who did not have reactive thrombocytosis were considered. In vitro thrombotic tendency in both groups of patients was assessed using maximal amplitude (normal range 54 to 72 mm) and alpha angle (normal range 47 to 74°) on the thromboelastograph. The associations between reactive thrombocytosis and C-reactive protein, the coagulation profile and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score were also evaluated. Patients with reactive thrombocytosis had an associated increased in vitro thrombotic tendency (maximal amplitude 77 vs 69 mm, mean difference 8 mm, 95% confidence interval 4.9 to 10.9, P=0.001), a higher fibrinogen concentration (7.2 vs 5.8 g/l, P=0.003), and a higher incidence of infection requiring antibiotics (50 vs 27%, P=0.025) compared to patients without thrombocytosis. Platelet count had a relatively linear relationship with the maximal amplitude and the alpha angle of the thromboelastograph tracing (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.53, P=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, only reactive thrombocytosis (odds ratio 5.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3-27.8, P=0.025) and activated partial thromboplastin time (odds ratio 0.93 per second increment, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 0.99, P=0.016) were significantly associated with a strong in vitro thrombotic tendency. In summary, reactive thrombocytosis was associated with infection requiring antibiotics and evidence of increased in vitro thrombotic tendency in critically ill patients."

CD010438,0,22225856,0,Critical role of factors II and X during coumarin anticoagulation and their combined measurement with a new Fiix-prothrombin time.,"Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are monitored with prothrombin time (PT) based assays that are equally sensitive to reductions in factors II, VII or X. We compared the effect of vitamin K dependent (VKD) coagulation factors on PT and also on rotational thromboelastometric (ROTEM) parameters. The PT was equally sensitive to reductions in factors II, VII or X but ROTEM parameters correlated poorly with the PT in anticoagulated patients´ plasmas. ROTEM parameters were more affected by mild and moderate reductions in FII or FX than by FVII or FIX which had little influence except at very low coagulant activity. We developed a modified PT that was sensitive only to reductions in factors II and X. The Fiix-PT (Fiix-INR) correlated well with PT (INR) but the Fiix-INR fluctuated less than the INR in an anticoagulated patient reflecting its insensitivity to FVII. The ROTEM results suggest that mild to moderate reductions in factors II or X are more important during clot formation than factors VII or IX. Reductions in FII and X may better reflect anticoagulation with VKA than FVII or IX. The new Fiix-PT may more accurately reflect the degree of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients treated with VKA than the current PT which is subject to a confounding variation caused by FVII."
CD010438,0,12108924,0,The effects of cardiopulmonary bypass with hollow fiber membrane oxygenator on blood clotting measured by thromboelastography.,"In cardiac surgical patients we investigated the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with a hollow fiber membrane oxygenator on blood clotting measured by thromboelastography (TEG). We found only a minimal change in the strength of blood clot described either by the TEG parameter MA (maximum amplitude) or by the shear modulus G calculated from MA. After CPB there was also a significant tendency towards hypercoagulation as defined by shortened parameters R, K and increased a-angle. After comparison with published data obtained in cardiac surgical patients using a bubble oxygenator we conclude that currently used extracorporeal technology exerts a less negative influence on blood clotting than had been conceived previously."
CD010438,0,2742171,0,Comparison of viscoelastic measures of coagulation after cardiopulmonary bypass.,"Postoperative hemorrhage remains a major cause of morbidity after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Treatment remains empiric because of the need for immediate correction and the lack of availability of rapid intraoperative coagulation monitoring (except for ACT) at most institutions. Thrombelastography (TEG) and Sonoclot analysis (SCT) are measures of viscoelastic properties of blood which allow rapid intraoperative evaluation of coagulation factor and platelet activity as well as overall clot integrity from a single blood sample. Routine coagulation tests (RCT) including activated clotting time (ACT), prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen level (FIB), and platelet count (PLT) were determined and compared to TEG and SCT to assess which best predicted clinical hemostasis after CPB. Forty-two patients prospectively felt to be at high risk for excessive post-CPB bleeding had blood obtained for RCT, TEG, and SCT analysis before systemic heparinization and 30 min after protamine administration. Nine of 42 patients had excessive chest tube drainage, but no reoperations were required. After CPB, mean values for RCT were normal, but there were abnormalities in TEG and SCT parameters that reflect platelet-fibrin interaction. Both TEG and SCT were 100% accurate in predicting bleeding in these nine patients and, overall, both tests were significantly better predictors of postoperative hemorrhage than RCT. We conclude that viscoelastic determinants of clot strength may be abnormal after CPB and that SCT and TEG are, therefore, more useful than RCT for the detection and management of coagulation defects associated with CPB."

Clot formation was analysed by thromboelastography immediately after induction of anaesthesia and again 30 min after administration of aprotinin. Rate of clot formation was assessed using R (reaction time = rate of initial fibrin formation), K (clot formation time = rate of fibrin build-up and cross linking) and angle of clot formation (denoting speed at which solid clot forms). Strength of the clot was assessed by maximal amplitude of clot formation (MA) and % lysis after 30 and 60 min. Significant reduction of R and K times and increase in angle of clot formation was observed in groups A and B. This effect was not apparent in the other groups. In group D, an increase in R time was noted. These findings indicate a dose-dependent effect of aprotinin on rate of clot formation with an earlier clot formation at low doses."

CD010438,0,18420846,0,Coagulation monitoring: current techniques and clinical use of viscoelastic point-of-care coagulation devices.,"Perioperative monitoring of blood coagulation is critical to better understand causes of hemorrhage, to guide hemostatic therapies, and to predict the risk of bleeding during the consecutive anesthetic or surgical procedures. Point-of-care (POC) coagulation monitoring devices assessing the viscoelastic properties of whole blood, i.e., thrombelastography, rotation thrombelastometry, and Sonoclot analysis, may overcome several limitations of routine coagulation tests in the perioperative setting. The advantage of these techniques is that they have the potential to measure the clotting process, starting with fibrin formation and continue through to clot retraction and fibrinolysis at the bedside, with minimal delays. Furthermore, the coagulation status of patients is assessed in whole blood, allowing the plasmatic coagulation system to interact with platelets and red cells, and thereby providing useful additional information on platelet function. Viscoelastic POC coagulation devices are increasingly being used in clinical practice, especially in the management of patients undergoing cardiac and liver surgery. Furthermore, they provide useful information in a large variety of clinical scenarios, e.g., massive hemorrhage, assessment of hypo- and hypercoagulable states, guiding pro- and anticoagulant therapies, and in diagnosing of a surgical bleeding. A surgical etiology of bleeding has to be considered when viscoelastic test results are normal. In summary, viscoelastic POC coagulation devices may help identify the cause of bleeding and guide pro- and anticoagulant therapies. To ensure optimal accuracy and performance, standardized procedures for blood sampling and handling, strict quality controls and trained personnel are required."

It has recently been suggested that it may also be a useful tool to screen patients with hypercoagulable states. Limited published data on performance characteristics has led to speculation regarding its consistency and, therefore, validity of the results. This study was designed to assess the effect of stability of blood samples prior to testing, repeated sampling, intra- and inter-assay variability using the native, celite, tissue factor (TF) and Reopro-modified TEG. Analysis of native and celite samples after storage over 90 min showed a period of instability up to 30 min. Thereafter, all parameters between 30 and 90 min were stable [P = not significant (NS)]. When the same sample was repeatedly assayed, both native and celite TEG parameters showed a significant change towards hypercoagulability (P < 0.01), whereas the TF and Reopro-modified TEG showed no change. Intra- and inter-assay variability on samples tested after 30 min showed excellent reproducibility for all parameters (P = NS). The data suggest that the TEG is a useful tool in haemostasis but requires a formal standard operating procedure to be adopted that takes into account the initial period of sample instability."

Lipophilic oligonucleotides can be used to build nanotechnological structures on membrane surfaces, taking advantage of the specific Watson-Crick base pairing. We used a cholesteryl-TEG anchor first described by Pfeiffer and Hook (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 10224-10225). The cholesterol-based anchor molecules were found to incorporate well into lipid membranes without disturbing the bilayer structure and dynamics. In contrast to cholesterol, which is known to induce significant condensation of the membrane lipids, the cholesteryl-TEG anchor does not display this property. When the cholesteryl-TEG moiety was covalently bound to an oligonucleotide, the resulting lipophilic DNA molecules inserted spontaneously into lipid membranes without altering their structure. The duplex formed by two complementary cholesteryl-TEG oligonucleotides had increased thermodynamic stability compared to the same oligonucleotides without the anchor, both in solution and incorporated into lipid membranes. Since the cholesteryl-TEG anchor lacks the characteristic properties of cholesterol, oligonucleotides modified with this anchor are equally distributed between liquid-disordered and liquid-ordered domains in ""raft"" forming membranes. As an example of an application of these lipophilic oligonucleotides, cholesteryl-TEG-DNA was incorporated into supported lipid bilayers formed on polyelectrolyte-coated silica microparticles. The modified oligonucleotides were stably inserted into the lipid membrane and retained their recognition properties, therefore enabling further functionalization of the particles."

However, bleeding complications in patients with liver disease are unpredictable, with the majority of haemorrhagic episodes occurring as a result of porto-systemic varices. Thrombosis is an increasingly recognised complication and systemic hypercoagulability may contribute to the development of parenchymal extinction and accelerated hepatic fibrosis. Routine laboratory tests do not reliably predict the risk of haemorrhage and the optimal management strategy to avert potential bleeding complications is yet to be established. There may be a future role for global coagulation assays, such as thrombelastography and thrombin generation, in both stratifying the risk of bleeding and guiding management of these patients."

Cells isolated from human atrial specimens during cardiac surgery were used to assess the effects of Teg (1, 10, 30 and 100 nM) on action potential and I(f) (funny current) by patch-clamp technique. Results showed that Teg (at all concentrations tested) did not significantly affect action potential characteristics of atrial myocytes when driven at different rates (0.2, 0.5 and 1 Hz). In contrast, 5HT significantly prolonged action potential duration (1 and 10 nM) and caused cell un-excitability (100 nM). Teg, at the highest concentration tested (100 nM, corresponding to 10 times C(max), produced by the recommended dose of 6 mg b.i.d.) increased the I(f) amplitude and caused a shift of its activation curve. This effect of a high concentration of Teg is not considered clinically relevant. When evaluated on single human atrial cells, Teg does not appear to exhibit arrhythmogenic properties, as it did not affect the action potential profile."

The product obtained with the Dideco Vivacell cell separator showed a low percentage of mononuclear cells (38%) in the final product and a high platelet efficiency (38%). The Baxter CS3000 Plus cell separator required the longest time to load and prime the kit (18 min), it showed a high MNC efficiency (68%), with the highest percentage of MNC in the final product, the highest platelet efficiency (45%), a low red blood cell contamination in the final product (2.7 mL), the highest extracorporeal volume (450 mL) and a high percentage of technical failures (15%). The product obtained with the Fresenius AS104 cell separator with P1Y kit showed the highest final volume (297 mL), the lowest platelet efficiency (12%) and the lowest extracorporeal volume (230 mL). The same cell separator with C4Y kit showed a lower MNC efficiency (52 vs 60%) and a higher percentage of MNC in final product (63 vs 41%). The platelet contamination in final product was the lowest (18 x 10(9)/100 mL). The Haemonetics MCS3p cell separator required the lowest time to load and prime the kit (5 min), it showed the highest MNC efficiency (71%). The blood volume processed per hour (1328 mL) and the percentage of MNC in final product was lowest (32%), the extracorporeal volume (450 mL) was the highest. The Cobe Spectra cell separator allowed to process the highest blood volume per hour (3383 mL) and the final product had the lowest red blood cell contamination (2.3 mL/100 mL). The Dideco Excel cell separator required the longest time to load and prime the kit (18 min), the lowest MNC efficiency (38%), the highest platelet contamination in final product. Furthermore this machine showed the highest percentage of technical failure (20%). None of the six instruments have all the required preconditions and the ideal cell separator for peripheral stem cell apheresis at present is not available on the market."

CD010438,0,19816662,0,[Coagulation management in the treatment of multiple trauma].,"In recent years a new understanding of trauma-associated hemorrhaging and trauma-induced coagulopathy has been achieved. This coagulopathy is multifactorial with the predominant mechanisms being tissue trauma, shock and hypoperfusion which can lead to hyperfibrinolysis by activation of the endothelium. Routinely tested coagulation parameters, such as prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, are frequently employed for decision making but remain problematic as they do not give any information on clot stability, lysis or platelet function. Thrombelastometry seems to be a useful alternative. A pro-active anticipatory approach is required for a successful outcome to be achieved as rescue correction is more difficult than prevention. While the pathophysiological conception of causal relationship of the mentioned therapeutic options is conclusive, an evidence-based validation by randomized controlled studies is mostly lacking. The emergency and anesthesiological concept of damage control resuscitation consists of limiting volume therapy with crystalloids and colloids to reach a mean arterial pressure > or =65 mmHg (higher for head injuries), active (re-)warming management, the prevention of a pH< or =7.2 and a base excess (BE) < or =-6 mmol/l. The early and sufficient application of hemostatic drugs is essential. Because erythrocytes play a substantial role in the coagulation process, hemoglobin (Hb) values of around 6. 2 mmol/l (10 g/dl) and/or a hematocrit of 30% should be strived for when massive non-arrested hemorrhaging occurs. After severe multiple trauma a fibrinogen deficit develops and must be adequately compensated. If coagulation therapy is carried out using fresh frozen plasma sufficient quantities (20-30 ml/kgBW) must be administered to correspondingly raise the coagulation factors. Prothrombin complex concentrates can be helpful to optimize thrombin generation during severe hemorrhaging. Because hyperfibrinolysis occurs more often than previously assumed during severe trauma, an anti-fibrinolytic therapy should be used especially for patients with an instable circulation. The platelet count should not go below 100,000/microl when hemorrhaging occurs after multiple trauma. For thrombocytopathic patients with diffuse bleeding desmopressin (DDAVP) is a therapeutic option and the ""off label"" use of recombinant activated factor VIIa (rFVIIa) remains an option for individual situations with stringent indications and when the above named measures to optimize the coagulation situation have been taken."
CD010438,0,22805201,0,A modified EPA Method 1623 that uses tangential flow hollow-fiber ultrafiltration and heat dissociation steps to detect waterborne Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp.,"Cryptosporidium and Giardia species are two of the most prevalent protozoa that cause waterborne diarrheal disease outbreaks worldwide. To better characterize the prevalence of these pathogens, EPA Method 1623 was developed and used to monitor levels of these organisms in US drinking water supplies (12). The method has three main parts; the first is the sample concentration in which at least 10 L of raw surface water is filtered. The organisms and trapped debris are then eluted from the filter and centrifuged to further concentrate the sample. The second part of the method uses an immunomagnetic separation procedure where the concentrated water sample is applied to immunomagnetic beads that specifically bind to the Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts allowing for specific removal of the parasites from the concentrated debris. These (oo)cysts are then detached from the magnetic beads by an acid dissociation procedure. The final part of the method is the immunofluorescence staining and enumeration where (oo)cysts are applied to a slide, stained, and enumerated by microscopy. Method 1623 has four listed sample concentration systems to capture Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in water: Envirochek filters (Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI), Envirochek HV filters (Pall Corporation), Filta-Max filters (IDEXX, Westbrook, MA), or Continuous Flow Centrifugation (Haemonetics, Braintree, MA). However, Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cyst recoveries have varied greatly depending on the source water matrix and filters used(1,14). A new tangential flow hollow-fiber ultrafiltration (HFUF) system has recently been shown to be more efficient and more robust at recovering Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts from various water matrices; moreover, it is less expensive than other capsule filter options and can concentrate multiple pathogens simultaneously(1-3,5-8,10,11). In addition, previous studies by Hill and colleagues demonstrated that the HFUF significantly improved Cryptosporidium oocysts recoveries when directly compared with the Envirochek HV filters(4). Additional modifications to the current methods have also been reported to improve method performance. Replacing the acid dissociation procedure with heat dissociation was shown to be more effective at separating Cryptosporidium from the magnetic beads in some matrices(9,13) . This protocol describes a modified Method 1623 that uses the new HFUF filtration system with the heat dissociation step. The use of HFUF with this modified Method is a less expensive alternative to current EPA Method 1623 filtration options and provides more flexibility by allowing the concentration of multiple organisms."

CD010438,0,16525587,0,Thrombelastography for the monitoring of lipopolysaccharide induced activation of coagulation.,"During Gram-negative sepsis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and induces complex responses of immune system and haemostasis. In the present study we investigated whether thrombelastography is suitable to monitor the LPS-induced activation of coagulation. Whole blood samples from healthy volunteers were incubated with LPS for various incubation periods (0-5 hrs), thereafter rotation thrombelastography was performed. Incubation of whole blood (>or=3 h) with LPS markedly reduced clotting time; after 5 hrs the variable was reduced from 459+/-39 sec to 80+/-20 sec while the other thrombelastography variables (angle alpha, clot formation time, maximal clot formation) remained unaltered. EC(50) of the LPS effect on whole blood clotting time was 18 microg/ml. In isolated leukocytes, diluted in platelet poor plasma, far lower LPS-concentrations were effective: 10 ng/ml LPS reduced clotting time from 439+/-68 sec to 200+/-56 sec. Experiments with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and active site-inhibited factor VIIa revealed that LPS exerts its effects via the synthesis of tissue factor. Addition of tissue factor to whole blood samples revealed that a concentration of 100 fmol/l can be detected using thrombelastography. In whole blood samples the tissue factor concentration induced by LPS amounted up to 12 pmol/l. In summary, thrombelastography proved to be a sensitive and reliable tool for the determination of LPS-induced tissue factor mediated activation of haemostasis in whole blood samples."

CD010438,0,7512376,0,Substitution of class II alpha chain polymorphic residues defines location of A alpha k serologic epitopes and alters association between alpha beta and Ii polypeptides.,"Structure-function studies of the MHC class II alpha chain have been performed by constructing a panel of A alpha k cDNA genes with one or more d allele substitutions at each polymorphic residue of the alpha 1 domain. The altered genes (A alpha k*) were transfected into a B lymphoma cell line (BKO), which is deficient in A alpha mRNA but retains constitutive wild-type A beta k mRNA expression. Cytofluorometric analysis of cell surface A alpha k* Ak beta molecules was used to map the polymorphic alpha chain residues comprising four serologic epitopes. A alpha k-reactive mAbs 1E9, 2A2, and 3F12 recognize an epitope that includes the polymorphic residue 44 of the A alpha k polypeptide, and the A alpha k-reactive antibody, K24-199, recognizes a conformationally determined epitope influenced by residues from all three polymorphic regions. In addition, we confirmed previous studies demonstrating that la.19 and la.2 mAbs bind to epitopes adjacent to residue 75 in A alpha k. A cell surface negative expression variant also was identified in the panel of mutant cell lines and biochemically characterized. Substitution of six d allele polymorphic residues at positions 11, 14, 28, 69, 70, and 75 in the A alpha k polypeptide (T.EG A alpha k* A beta k*) results in an A alpha k* polypeptide that associates with the A alpha k polypeptide but does not associate with the li polypeptide. This defect in li-A alpha k A beta k interaction is associated with a conformational change in the alpha 1 beta 1 domain that was identified by altered reactivity of the T.EG complex with conformationally dependent anti-alpha and anti-beta mAbs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010438,0,2815074,0,Factor XIII is not involved in human platelet-collagen interaction.,"A role of factor XIII (FXIII) on the interaction of human platelets with collagen was investigated using either formaldehyde fixed-washed platelets (FWP) or nonfixed platelets. The adhesion of FWP to bovine type I collagen was measured by using either an aggregometer or a collagen immobilized glass beads column. The interaction of non-fixed human platelets with collagen was measured with in vitro bleeding time (Thrombostat-4,000), which was performed by passing citrated whole blood through the filter covered with rat type I collagen under the constant shear stress. FWP adhesion to the collagen immobilized column (1,300 micrograms collagen) was not changed by the addition of commercial FXIII preparation (Fibrogammin); the adhesion was 42.7% in the presence of 1% human serum albumin, 42-43% in the presence of 1-2 U/ml of FXIII. The addition of rabbit antibody to FXIII to normal FWP did not change the degree of adhesion; 42.3% (1:100 anti-FXIII) and 46.1% (normal rabbit serum). Furthermore, platelets from the patient with congenital FXIII deficiency normally aggregated by bovine collagen and the adhesion of the patient FWP to the collagen was similar to that of normal FWP. Prolongation of partial thromboplastin time and the changes of thromboelastograph of normal plasma were observed after mixing with the collagen, and factor VIII, FXIII and von Willebrand factor were adsorbed by the collagen. The amount of FXIII in normal human plasma bound to collagen was 17, 23 and 54% at the concentration of the collagen 250, 500 and 1,000 micrograms/ml, respectively. The binding of plasma ristocetin cofactor was not different between normal control and the patient with FXIII deficiency. These data suggest that FXIII is not involved in human platelet interaction with the type I collagen, while FXIII in normal human plasma binds to the collagen."

CD010438,0,21641201,0,Labor and delivery in a patient with hemophilia B.,"Hemophilia B is a rare X-linked disorder that may cause dramatic bleeding. Women account for only 3.2% of those clinically affected. The X-linked inheritance frequently delays the diagnosis in women and may expose the patient to an increased risk of adverse events. There is limited experience with these patients during labor and delivery. A 28-year-old primiparous woman with hemophilia B (bleeding phenotype) delivered a male infant by an unplanned cesarean delivery under general anesthesia following treatment with factor IX and normalization of her coagulation parameters, guided by thromboelastography. Postpartum vaginal bleeding required transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells. Factor IX supplementation continued for one week. Once diagnosed with hemophilia B, a multidisciplinary approach and advanced antenatal planning can increase the likelihood of a safe delivery. Neuraxial approaches and cesarean delivery are recommended only after normalization of the coagulation profile. The male fetus of a hemophilia A or B patient requires special attention. Operative vaginal delivery and invasive fetal monitoring should be avoided. Thromboelastography is an excellent technique to assess parturients with bleeding disorders or peripartum hemorrhage and may be underused."

CD010438,0,6252623,0,[Introduction to the study of hemostasis in cirrhotic patients (author's transl)].,"Any diffuse lesion of the liver induces permanent hypercoagulation with subsequent permanent lysis and possible consumption or DIVC/Hemostasis depends on two distinct mechanisms: the platelets, whose functional activity is more important than numbers, and the coagulolytic equilibrium of the plasma. Apart from the activating and inhibiting enzymes of coagulation and lysis, the lungs and liver play an important role. The lungs filter and then determine lysis of the corpuscular agglomerates. The liver produces epuration of the activated factors and prothrombinase, as well as the plasminogen activator. Except in extremely severe cases, however, these functions are rarely involved. Investigations must be complete and include a test of platelet aggregation, a TEG on total blood to analyze whole coagulation, and tests for consumption and lysis. Coagulation and bleeding time tests are of great value during severe hemorrhagic attacks. Pathological examination should evaluate the condition of the vascular state and, more particularly, the presence of fibrin thrombi with the appropriate methods."
CD010438,0,19486172,0,Lower doses of rFVIIa therapy are safe and effective for surgical interventions in patients with severe FXI deficiency and inhibitors.,"Severe FXI deficiency is a rare injury-related bleeding disorder. In patients with FXI inhibitors, surgeries may be treated using recombinant activated factor VII; however, treatment safety is a major concern and the best dosing regimen as well as mode of administration is still to be defined. We describe four patients with severe factor XI deficiency and inhibitors to FXI, undergoing eight (four major) surgical procedures treated with continuous infusion of rFVIIa. Following acute MI that evolved after surgery of our first patient, all other patients were treated with low-dose bolus rFVIIa followed by low-dose continuous infusion of rFVIIa. Haemostasis was successfully achieved and no further thrombotic complications occurred. To support our clinical results ex-vivo thromboelastography studies were performed, demonstrating the differences of clot formation and lysis between patients with FXI deficiency and healthy controls and suggesting that low-dose rFVIIa corrects coagulation similarly to high-dose rFVIIa in FXI deficiency. Recombinant FVIIa at low doses may effectively induce haemostasis and seems to be a safe treatment mode in patients with FXI deficiency and inhibitors undergoing surgeries."

Essener Runde algorithm.,"Both, severe haemorrhage and blood transfusion are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is of particular importance to stop perioperative bleeding as fast and as possible to avoid unnecessary transfusion. Viscoelastic test (ROTEM® or TEG®) allow for early prediction of massive transfusion and goal-directed therapy with specific haemostatic drugs, coagulation factor concentrates, and blood products. Growing consensus points out, that plasma-based coagulation screening tests like aPTT and PT are inappropriate for monitoring coagulopathy or guide transfusion therapy. Increasing evidence of more than 5000 surgical or trauma patients points towards the beneficial effects of a thrombelastography or -metry based approach in diagnosis and goal-directed therapy of perioperative massive haemorrhage. The Essener Runde task force is a group of clinicians of various specialties (anaesthesiology, intensive care, haemostaseology, haematology, internal medicine, transfusion medicine, surgery) interested in perioperative coagulation management. The ROTEM diagnostic algorithm of the Essener Runde task force was created to standardise and simplify the interpretation of ROTEM® results in perioperative settings and to present their possible implications for therapeutic interventions in severe bleeding. To exemplify, this text mainly focuses on coagulation management in trauma."

Twenty patient received 1 litre per day over a period of ten days and were compared with 16 controls receiving glucose and amino acides without lipids. Studies of haemostasis included: overall coagulation by the thrombo-elastogram, P.R.P. (platelet rich plasma), estimation of the co-factors of the prothrombin complex, thrombin and reptilase times, platelet count, platelet stickiness using the method of HELLEM, platelet aggregation using the method of Born, plasminogen and plasmin activity by the pH STAT method, and P.D.F. levels. These examinations were carried out on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th postoperative days. The results in the patients receiving Trive 1000 were as follows: no change in blood coagulation, progressive fall in platelet activity in the sense of hypoaggregability which was significant from the 5th day onwards only. There was no change in fibrinolysis. By contrast, there was anaemia, as determined on the basis of a fall in haematocrit, maximal on the 5th day and attributed by the authors to the haemolytic properties of triglycerides.

Less significant variations of the coagulographic parameters were observed in other crewmembers. The above changes (an increase in endogenous heparin, an acceleration of the fibrinolytic activity) can be regarded as the protective-adaptive reaction of the anticoagulatory system aimed at reducing hypercoagulation during the emotional stress-effect of the flight."

CD010438,0,20566899,0,Gel point and fractal microstructure of incipient blood clots are significant new markers of hemostasis for healthy and anticoagulated blood.,"Here we report the first application of a fractal analysis of the viscoelastic properties of incipient blood clots. We sought to ascertain whether the incipient clot's fractal dimension, D(f,) could be used as a functional biomarker of hemostasis. The incipient clot is formed at the gel point (GP) of coagulating blood, the GP demarcating a functional change from viscoelastic liquid to a viscoelastic solid. Incipient clots formed in whole healthy blood show a clearly defined value of D(f) within a narrow range that represents an index of clotting in health, where D(f) = 1.74 (± 0.07). A significant relationship is found between the incipient clot formation time, T(GP), and the activated partial thromboplastin time, whereas the association of D(f) with the microstructural characteristics of the incipient clot is supported by its significant correlation with fibrinogen. Our study reveals that unfractionated heparin not only prolongs the onset of clot formation but has a significant effect on its fractal microstructure. A progressive increase in unfractionated heparin concentration results in a linear decrease in D(f) and a corresponding prolongation in T(GP). The results represent a new, quantitative measure of clot quality derived from measurements on whole blood samples."

Now, as a result of the use of, and progress in, automatic blood separation techniques, the quality of platelets is continually being improved so that we currently have access to purified concentrates which are not contaminated by red cells and contain only very few white cells. In view of the wide experience available to us, it was useful to monitor a number of qualitative parameters indicating platelet activation during storage. We monitored platelet aggregation, release of beta thromboglobulin, activation of complement and other basic parameters in seven platelet concentrates from seven cell separators (Cobe Spectra, MCS Haemonetics, CS3000+, Baxter, Excel Dideco, Autopheresis C Baxter, and V50 Haemonetics). We found that in the majority of cases aggregation was greatly reduced during storage. Release of beta thromboglobulin and activation of complement increased. pH remained within acceptable limits in some cases. However, in others (MCS, Excel), a decrease in pH < 6.0 was found. To conclude, although CAP, which are from a single donor, reduce the risks of transfusion, they are not protected from physical alteration and therefore from reduction in the clinical effects of transfusion. It is therefore necessary to improve the storage conditions of these cells in the future, for example by designing new plastics, or adding platelet storage media. Basic biological parameters should also be defined, within the framework of quality assurance, to evaluate platelet quality."

In a subset analysis of patients receiving red blood cell transfusions (n = 56; 47%), Hextend-treated patients had a lower mean estimated blood loss (956 mL less; P = 0.02) and were less likely to receive calcium supplementation (P = 0.04). Patients receiving HES demonstrated significant prolongation of time to onset of clot formation (based on TEG) not seen in the Hextend patients (P < 0.05). No Hextend patient experienced a related serious adverse event, and there was no difference in the total number of adverse events between the two groups. The results of this study demonstrate that Hextend, with its novel buffered, balanced electrolyte formulation, is as effective as 6% hetastarch in saline for the treatment of hypovolemia and may be a safe alternative even when used in volumes up to 5 L."
CD010438,0,23039961,0,[Diagnosis and treatment of trauma-induced coagulopathy].,"Trauma-induced coagulopathy is frequent and complex, and is responsible for an impairment of trauma outcome. Diagnosis of trauma coagulopathy is usually done with standard biology but recently new technics arose and gave us the opportunity to have faster information on coagulopathy with quick INR measure or clot formation study with thrombelastometry. Treatment of the coagulopathy should be done earlier in the course of trauma. Two strategies are possible that include either the association of RBC, platelet and FFP in a predefined ratio, or the use of factor concentrates guided with thrombelastometry. Treatment of favouring factors such as hypothermia, acidosis and hypocalcemia is also mandatory."

CD010438,0,10168551,0,Plateletpheresis: what's new?,"1995 has brought several novelties into the field of thrombocytapheresis. The most important is the presentation by Baxter of the Amicus CFC apparatus that, in a two-vein collection time of 51-53 min, collects 3.93-4.13 x 10(11) platelets contaminated by 0.2 x 10(6) white blood cells (WBC) with an efficiency of 72-74%. Similar results are obtained in 55 min, in single-needle procedures, with a collection efficiency of 70.7%, a total yield of 4.3 x 10(11) and a contamination of 0.9 x 10(6) WBC. Presently the machine cannot collect red blood cells (RBC), along with platelets, as does the DFC Haemonetics MCS3p. With this machine in mandatory single-needle procedures lasting 80-85 min, approximately 4.5 x 10(11) platelets can be collected with a WBC contamination of 3.1 x 10(6). Along with the platelet cells (PC), with the SDP PRC protocol at the end of each pass it is possible to collect aliquots of plasma red blood cells (PRBC) (10-50 mL) with a haematocrit of 65%. Depending on the number of passes and on the donor's body weight (BW), from 1 and 2 U/PRBC containing approximately 55 g of haemoglobin (Hb) each can be obtained. This method not only costs less but also immunological and viral risks for the patients are more efficiently addressed since it is possible to reduce the number of allogeneic exposures in the same transfusion event. PRBC can also be collected with the Fresenius AS104 and the Dideco Excel apparatuses. Dideco is presently using the ""Genova"" separation chamber, which can collect an average of 4.8 x 10(11) platelets contaminated with 0.5 x 10(6) WBC, in approximately 55 min. The ACD-A-to-blood ratio may be as low as 1/20 since the very last belts and lines are coated with non-thrombogenic substances. Therefore, there is no alteration of the quality of the platelets as evaluated with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) anti-CD 62, 63, 36 and 51, no extra haemorrhagic risk for the donors and citrate reactions and microaggregate formation are totally eliminated. In 1995 there has also been some rejuvenation of the older cell separators. The CS3000+ uses the TN6/PLT 30 combination of separation collection chambers. Platelets are collected in only 30 mL of plasma, and non-plasma solutions containing acetate can be used for their resuspension. The Fresenius AS204 is ready for better-quality combined platelet collection, and RBC-PC collection with Cobe Spectra is under evaluation along with the leucocyte reduction system that apparently brings leucocyte contamination down to 0.35 x 10(5). This interest in thrombocytapheresis is also the result of the challenge that thrombopoietin phase I and II trials have promoted."

CD010438,0,12643318,0,Global anticoagulant effects of a synthetic anti-factor Xa inhibitor (DX-9065a): implications for interventional use.,"Heparin has been conventionally used as an anticoagulant for medical and surgical indications. Because factor Xa is an essential component of the prothrombinase complex and leads to the generation of thrombin, its inhibition has become a focus of newer antithrombotic drug development. The in vitro anticoagulant profile of DX-9065a, a synthetic direct factor Xa inhibitor, was studied using activated clotting time assay, thrombelastography, and global clotting tests, such as prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), diluted aPTT, Heptest, Heptest-HI, dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT), thrombin time, ecarin clotting time, and amidolytic anti-Xa assay. In addition, the effect of DX-9065a on platelet aggregation and inhibition of thrombin generation markers (FPA, F1+2, and TAT) were studied. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of DX-9065a were also studied in a non-human primate (Macaca mulatta) model. DX-9065a produced a concentration-dependent increase in the Hemochron celite ACT and HemoTec ACT. Clotting times of 538 +/- 19 and 401 +/- 12, respectively, were reached at a concentration of 25 microg/mL signifying that DX-9065a may be useful in interventional cardiological procedures. DX-9065a prolonged the r-time on thrombelastography. DX-9065a did not show any effect on adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-, collagen-, epinephrine-, and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 10 microgram/mL. DX-9065a exhibited a concentration-dependent prolongation of the PT, aPTT, diluted aPTT, Heptest, dRVVT, and reached the clotting times of 51.6, 132, 193, 47.9, 129.9 seconds, respectively, at a final concentration of 12.5 microgram/mL; compared to a control value of 10.6, 30.2, 41.9, 14, 32.2 seconds, respectively. DX-9065a did not affect the ecarin clotting time and thrombin time at concentrations up to 12.5 microgram/mL. Because DX-9065a prolonged the dRVVT, this may impact diagnostic screening of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus."
CD010438,0,2115010,0,[Preparations of alpha-lipoic acid: the dynamics of their content in the blood and their effect on hemostasis in lesions of the human liver].,The changes in blood coagulating activity before and after treatment with alpha-lipoic acid drugs as compared with blood lipoic acid content were studied in 130 patients with chronic diffuse diseases of the liver of the virus and alcohol etiology. A moderate correlation between the increase in blood alpha-lipoic acid concentration in patients with the liver diseases during the replacement therapy with alpha-lipoic acid drugs and a number of parameters of thrombelastogram was established. It was shown that relief of coenzyme deficit against the background of treatment with lipoic acid is associated with relief of hypocoagulative syndrome and an elevation of the blood ATP level. It is suggested that the ability of the coenzyme to stimulate the bioenergetic protection of hemostasis processes plays the important role in the mechanism of action of alpha-lipoic acid drugs.
CD010438,0,21157299,0,Carbon monoxide releasing molecule-2 attenuates the anticoagulant and amplifies the hypofibrinolytic effects of hypothermia in human plasma in vitro.,"Hypothermia is known to contribute to coagulopathy in trauma and other major surgical procedures. Although the effects of hypothermia on coagulation have been characterized, the effects on fibrinolysis remained to be elucidated. Thus, our goals were to discern the effects of hypothermia on fibrinolysis in human plasma, and secondarily determine if a new procoagulant/antifibrinolytic molecule, carbon monoxide releasing molecule (tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer; CORM-2) would modify thrombus growth/disintegration under hypothermic conditions. Normal plasma was exposed to 0 or 100 μmol/l CORM-2, with coagulation activated by tissue factor and fibrinolysis initiated with 100 U/ml tissue-type plasminogen activator. Plasma samples were exposed to 37°, 35°, 33°, 31°, 29°, or 27°C (n = 6 per temperature/CORM-2 concentration). Thrombus growth/disintegration kinetics were monitored with thrombelastography until clot lysis time occurred. Hypothermia significantly prolonged the onset and decreased the velocity of clot growth in plasma without decreasing clot strength. Although hypothermia did not affect the time to onset of fibrinolysis, it did significantly decrease the velocity of lysis. The addition of CORM-2 significantly increased the velocity of clot growth and clot strength at all temperatures tested compared with unexposed plasma. Further, CORM-2 addition significantly prolonged the onset of fibrinolysis and diminished the velocity of lysis. Hypothermia resulted in slower growing, slower lysing thrombi in normal plasma. CORM-2 enhanced coagulation and markedly attenuated fibrinolysis at all temperatures tested. Further investigation is warranted to determine if CORM-2 administration can improve hemostasis in preclinical models of hypothermia and trauma."

CD010438,0,9382230,0,[The arteriovenous difference in osmotic and hemostatic indices as a criterion for the early diagnosis of pulmonary complications in severe combined trauma].,"The arteriovenous difference in the values of plasma and its main ingredients' osmolality and hemostasis were examined in patients with grave combined injuries complicated with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in the posttraumatic period. The findings showed a changed trend of arteriovenous difference in the osmotic homeostasis parameters in comparison with those during on uneventful course of combined injury: a-v Dosm. in stage IV RDS is (-)22.9 +/- 13.5 mosm/kg H2O versus 3.36 +/- 3.51 mosm/kg H2O in an uncomplicated course (p < 0.001). The arteriovenous difference for plasma COD was 8.1 +/- 3.0 mm Hg and (-)0.5 +/- 0.7 mm Hg in an uncomplicated course (p < 0.001). These changes permit a conclusion about the impaired osmolality regulating function of the lungs in RDS. Analysis of the arteriovenous difference of hemostasis once again confirms the presence of disorders in the hemostasis regulating function of the lungs: the arteriovenous difference of the structural and chronometric values of thromboelastogram is inverted, which indicates an increase of the coagulation potential of arterial blood: the a-v is equal to difference of blood clotting time 48 h after the injury and is (-)0.1 +/- 0.04 min, in contrast to the uneventful course: 2.5 +/- 0.27 min (p < 0.01): the a-v equal to the coagulation index difference was 2.26 +/- 0.49 arb. U, in contrast to (-)2.0 +/- 0.13 arb. U in an uncomplicated course of heating. Disorders in the other than respiratory functions of the lungs develop 11 h earlier than clear-cut x-ray signs of RDS appear, which gives us grounds to consider these changes as the earliest diagnostic criterion of RDS."
CD010438,0,7373993,0,[Change in the blood coagulating properties during ergometry in ischemic heart disease].,"During ergometric examination of 92 patients with ischemic heart disease and 35 healthy individuals blood coagulation was studied by recording thromboelastograms and electrocoagulograms and determining blood platelet aggregation, fibrinolytic activity and levels of fibrinogen and free heparin in blood. In 65 patients these values in ergometry were determined after treatment with obsidan. It was shown that during physical load there is an intensification of hypercoagulation processes embracing all phases of blood coagulation with simultaneous activation of anticoagulation mechanisms; in contrast to healthy individuals patients with ischemic heart disease are marked by prevalent hypercoagulation. Shifts in the system of blood coagulation depend on the volume of physical load. Heparin and fibrinolytic activity increases up to a certain load level, but when this is surpassed hypercoagulation processes prevail. This may be used as an additional criterion in determining the level of the training regimen in physical rehabilitation of patients."
CD010438,0,17264960,0,Recombinant human activated factor VII is thrombogenic in a rabbit model of cyclic flow reduction and does not reduce intra-abdominal bleeding.,"Recombinant human activated factor VII (rHuFVIIa) can reduce bleeding but may be associated with arterial thrombosis. We hypothesized that rHuFVIIa would increase the occurrence of cyclic flow reductions (CFR) and reduce intra-abdominal bleeding in an experimental model. An adapted Folts' model of carotid artery lesion and stenosis was used. Twenty four rabbits were randomized to receive rHuFVIIa (group F) or placebo (group P) in a double-blind fashion. A standardized injury to the common carotid artery resulted in CFR and/or thrombosis. Hematological values, coagulation and thromboelastographic (TEG) variables were compared. Intra-abdominal bleeding was evaluated by measuring blood loss from standardized hepatosplenic lesions. The median number (range) of spontaneous CFR [group P: 6 (0-15); group F: 8 (0-16)] was comparable between groups. The number of induced CFR (by ""shaking"" of the artery) needed to avert thrombosis (group F: 2; group P: 0; p < 0.05) and the incidence of complete carotid artery thrombosis (group F: 3; group P: 0; p < 0.05) were higher in group F. Intra-abdominal bleeding was similar in both groups. TEG analysis demonstrated a hypercoagulable state in both groups but the magnitude of the change was statistically more important in group F. rHuFVIIa increases thrombosis in a rabbit model of carotid artery injury. The bleeding from hepatic and splenic lesions is not reduced by administration of rHuFVIIa despite a hypercoagulable state confirmed by standard TEG analysis."
CD010438,0,16149021,0,Perioperative monitoring of primary and secondary hemostasis in coronary artery bypass grafting.,"On-pump cardiac surgery is accompanied by complex alterations of hemostasis. The excessive postoperative bleeding has been attributed to acquired platelet dysfunction, impaired plasmatic coagulation, and increased fibrinolysis. The characterization of the hemostatic defects responsible for bleeding is crucial for specific treatment and optimal clinical management of the patient. For rapid determination of platelet-dependent primary hemostatic capacity (PHC), the Platelet Function Analyzer PFA-100 system is available. To evaluate the PFA performance in perioperative monitoring, a study was performed in 49 patients selected for low bleeding risk undergoing selective primary coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We compared PHC with Simplate bleeding time (BT) and platelet aggregometry. Furthermore, we analyzed global hemostasis by thromboelastography (TEG) and plasmatic coagulation by standard clotting tests prothrombin time (PT, Quick), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT) and clotting factors and fibrinolysis by batroxobin (reptilase) time (RT). In all patients BT was postoperatively increased by 1.5- to 2-fold irrespective of perioperative complications and decreased to mildly prolonged values on the first postoperative day (1st day). In patients without complications, PHC in both collagen-adenosine diphosphate closure time (CADP-CT: 83 seconds preop, 78 seconds postop, and 74 seconds 1st day) and collagen-epinephrine closure time (CEPI-CT: 98 seconds preop, 95 seconds postop, 85 seconds 1st day) remained nearly stable. Apart from a patient with postoperative moderate thrombocytopenia, in bleeding patients no other significant defect of postoperative platelet hemostatic capacity was observed. However, on 1st day, the PHC of those patients was significantly reduced compared with non-bleeding patients. In patients with postoperative myocardial ischemia, increased PHC was identified by significantly shorter postoperative CADP-CT (66 seconds vs. 83 seconds) than in uncomplicated patients. By aggregometry, partial platelet dysfunction was observed in some patients without correlation to bleeding complications. In seven of 9 patients the postoperative bleeding complication was attributed to prolonged heparin anticoagulation and/or mildly enhanced fibrinogenolysis/fibrinolysis by TEG and standard plasmatic coagulation tests (TEG: k time 18 minutes vs. 8 minutes; aPTT: 47 seconds vs. 32 seconds; TT: 18.0 seconds vs. 12.3 seconds) and (RT: 19.5 seconds vs. 17.7 seconds). The impairment of PHC, platelet aggregation, and clotting factors observed on the 1st day in bleeding and in intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) patients are most likely secondary effects, for example, loss of active platelets and clotting factors, to the primary postoperative bleeding or implantation of the IABP. In conclusion, our data indicate that in standard CABG procedures highly variable alterations of the hemostatic system occur after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) even in patients with assumed low operative risks. For identification of post-CPB bleeding complications, thromboelastography, aPTT, and TT and heparin and batroxobin (reptilase) time as fibrinolysis-sensitive assays are useful. Platelet function appears to be rapidly restored in uncomplicated CABG. PHC determination by PFA-100 demonstrates a high specificity for adequate platelet function and, therefore, could be beneficial in improved transfusion of platelet concentrates. PHC testing by PFA-100 may help identify postoperative platelet hyper-reactivity associated with myocardial lesion."

CD010438,0,12032396,0,Effects of recombinant activated factor VII on coagulation measured by thromboelastography in liver transplantation.,"Besides the conventional laboratory tests, thromboelastography (TEG) is used to monitor hemostasis during liver transplantation. A previous pilot study suggested a beneficial effect of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) on transfusion requirements in liver transplantation. In the present study, we assess the effects of rFVIIa on coagulation variables and TEG. In six study patients, the prothrombin time (PT), the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and TEG variables [reaction time (r), kinetic time (k), or clot formation time, alpha angle (alpha), and maximal amplitude (MA)] were recorded before and after the administration of a bolus of 80 microg/kg rFVIIa. These patients were compared with six controls who did not receive rFVIIa. In contrast with the control group, a significant shortening of PT (P = 0.028) and aPTT (P = 0.028), r (P = 0.046) and k (P = 0.043) values, and a significant incline of the alpha angle (P = 0.028) were noticed after injection of rFVIIa, whereas MA increased not significantly (P = 0.075). rFVIIa rapidly improved coagulation variables in liver transplant patients including PT and aPTT. Of the TEG variables, r, k and alpha angle significantly improved, and MA showed a trend to increase. These data suggest that rFVIIa not only influences the speed of clot formation, but also the physical properties of the clot, which cannot be detected by routine coagulation tests."

We showed that basal hypocoagulability of our patients became normal after O2 administration. In this study we refer the thromboelastographic pattern observed in patients suffering from the same disease before and after hyperventilation. We don't find any changes about total coagulability either in patients or in healthy subjects after hyperventilation. Therefore we suggest that the absence of any changes is due to PCO2 and pH variations that occur at the same time of PO2 modification during hyperventilation; PCO2 and pH variations may influence the haemoglobin oxygen affinity and annul the effect of the increase PO2 on the tissue oxygenation. We suppose that the increase of patients suffering from chronic obstructive lung disease, is due to decreased fibrinolysis or to increased production of prostacycline induced by hyperventilation."
CD010438,0,16757291,0,"Analysis of cardiovascular, acid-base status, electrolyte, and coagulation changes during small bowel transplantation.","The analysis of intraoperative hemodynamic, metabolic, and coagulation disorders of the recipients in relation to the newly reperfused organ during intestinal transplantation is necessary for an optimal patient management during small bowel transplantation (SBT). The interaction may be minor or may lead to postreperfusion syndrome, producing intense hemodynamic instability, important metabolic changes, and coagulation disorders. This research is based upon experience with 27 patients who underwent SBT. We observed significant decreases in PAM and IRVS after reperfusion in accordance with minor changes of mean pulmonary artery pressure, central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The fall in pH upon revascularization was associated with a concomitant rise in partial carbon dioxide pressure probably due to the increased metabolic activity of the new organ. We found a significant increase in K levels, a rise that may be due to the output of metabolic products by the donor intestine. Patients displayed an hypocoagulative pattern, a derangement that did not seem to depend on ischemia time. It is possible that the same factors supporting the initial TEG pattern endure throughout the surgical procedure. The important and significant maximum amplitude indicator variation between the initial value and that after reperfusion may relate to the release of hypocoagulative factors superimposed on background abnormalities. These interesting metabolic disorders presumably reflected graft function and may provide predictive indices for a good outcome."
CD010438,0,22809250,0,Platelet mapping as part of modified thromboelastography (TEG®) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass.,"The platelet-mapping assay of the thromboelastograph was used to measure platelet aggregation and to examine the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on multiple platelet receptors and the role of altered receptor activity in postoperative bleeding. The percentage platelet aggregation for collagen, adenosine diphosphate and arachidonic acid was measured in 40 patients divided post-hoc into high- or low-bleeding groups depending on postoperative 24-h chest tube output. Platelet aggregation was lower after cardiopulmonary bypass compared to before it using collagen (mean (SD) 45 (25) vs 19 (12)%, p<0.001), adenosine diphosphate (76 (23) vs 35 (24)%, p<0.001), and arachidonic acid (61 (33) vs 31 (35)%, p<0.001). Only platelet aggregation as measured using collagen pre- and post-cardiopulmonary bypass was significantly less in the high- compared to the low-bleeding group. This finding was significantly correlated with the 24-h chest tube drainage, and it predicted postoperative bleeding with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 68%. Therefore, platelet aggregation is reduced following cardiopulmonary bypass, and this may play a role in predicting postoperative blood loss."

CD010438,0,3103556,0,Coagulopathy post peritoneovenous shunt.,"In 1942, 53% of medically treated patients with cirrhosis were dead 6 months after the onset of ascites. Only 30% survived 1 year. This dismal outlook has improved only slightly with advances in medicine. Yet, some internists reject the peritoneovenous shunt (PVS) for this fatal condition even if they are aware that a diminished blood volume causes the abnormal sodium retention responsible for ascites. Their objections are based on life-threatening complications of PVS, especially post shunt coagulopathy (PSC). Blood shed into the peritoneal cavity becomes incoagulable. Such blood is immediately coagulated by a protocoagulant (soluble collagen) and concurrently lysed by tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) secreted by the peritoneal serosa. Wide zones of lysis surround peritoneal tissue placed on fibrin plates. Large volumes of ascitic fluid infused into circulating blood simulates the fate of blood shed into the peritoneal cavity with lysis playing the major role. Addition of ascitic fluid to normal platelet-rich plasma in vitro initiates clot lysis on thromboelastogram (TEG). Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) counteracts this lysis. EACA and clotting factors normalize the TEG and arrest PSC. Disposal of ascitic fluid at surgery prevents or ameliorates PSC. Mild PSC was encountered only twice in 150+ consecutive patients (1.3%) with only one case being clinically significant (0.6%). Severe PSC occurred seven times in 98 early shunt patients whose ascitic fluid was not discarded. Severe PSC requires shunt interruption and control of bleeding with clotting factors and EACA. Peritoneal lavage with saline prevents the recurrence of PSC on reopening the shunt. In four patients, EACA and clotting factors were adequate to arrest coagulopathy. Three earlier patients died of PSC before its cause and treatment were understood. Proper management eliminates this life-threatening complication, and PSC cannot be considered a deterrent to PVS.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hematological status of neonates undergoing ECMO therapy, and to evaluate coagulation tests in predicting hemorrhagic risk. Following Institutional Review Board approval, 30 patients undergoing ECMO treatment were retrospectively entered into this study. Medical records were reviewed and indicators of hemostasis, transfusion, morbidity, and outcomes recorded. Assessment of coagulation was determined through serial analysis of platelet count, fibrinogen concentration, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), antithrombin III, fibrin split products, D-dimers, plasma free hemoglobin, activated clotting time, ionized calcium, and thrombelastography (TEG). Median total transfusion requirements for all patients were 1.79 ml/kg/ECMO hr. Fifty-seven percent of the 30 patients were diagnosed as coagulopathic according to Extracorporeal Life Support Organization standards. Patients were separated into either a hemorrhagic group (HEM, > 2.0 ml/kg/ECMO hr, n = 13) or a nonhemorrhagic group (N-HEM, n = 17), with HEM patients requiring twice the transfusion volume of N-HEM (p < 0.0001). Hemorrhagic complications were reported in 53.8% of the HEM patients vs. 35.3% in the N-HEM group. HEM patients were transfused with significantly greater quantities of platelets on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 and packed red blood cells on day 7 when compared to N-HEM (p < 0.05). TEG determination showed significant differences between groups on days 3 and 6 (p < 0.005), and 8 (p < 0.05). Derangements in hemostasis resulting from ECMO are profound, with methods of assessing coagulation complicated by both the variability in patient condition and lack of specificity of laboratory tests. Interpretation of TEG data has shown to be a valuable supplement for managing this challenging patient population."

In this study we evaluated the effects of AVP infusion on the coagulation system in advanced vasodilatory shock when compared to norepinephrine (NE) infusion alone. Forty-two patients with advanced vasodilatory shock (NE requirements >0.5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1), mean arterial blood pressure <70 mm Hg) were prospectively randomized to receive an additional AVP infusion (4 U/h) or NE infusion alone. Most patients received coagulation active treatment (fresh-frozen plasma, thrombocyte concentrates, coagulation factors, and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration with heparin). At baseline and 1, 24, and 48 h after randomization, coagulation laboratory variables and a modified thrombelastography were measured. There were no differences between groups in plasmatic coagulation variables. Although there was no significant difference between groups, platelet count significantly decreased in AVP patients (P = 0.036). There were no differences in results of modified thrombelastography analyses between groups. AVP infusion in advanced vasodilatory shock with severe multiorgan dysfunction syndrome does not increase plasma concentrations of Factor VIII, von Willebrand Factor antigen, and ristocetin Co-Factor but may stimulate platelet aggregation and induce thrombocytopenia. Global coagulation, assessed by modified thrombelastography, is not different from patients receiving NE infusion alone."

Concentrations greater than 50 ng/ml (blood) caused a biphasic development of clot stiffness. During the first phase, PGI2 partially inhibited the platelet involvement in coagulation causing initial clot formation at a normal time but with reduced clot stiffness. The second phase occurred after neutralization of PGI2 activity and was characterized by recovery of platelet activity to produce a final clot with normal shear modulus. The duration of the inhibitory effects depended on PGI2 concentration and hematocrit. With a normal hematocrit, a PGI2 concentration of 60 ng/ml caused an inhibition for about 40 min whereas a concentration of 100 ng/ml caused inhibition for about 75 min."

All these patients had a 50% narrowing in at least one vessel. 4 All patients were on conventional anti-anginal medication and the doses of their various therapies remained unchanged in the three months prior to and during the study period. 5 Therapy with dazoxiben 200 mg four times daily produced no alteration in the subjective or objective features of angina in these patients. There was no alteration in angina attack rate, glyceryl trinitrate consumption or duration of treadmill exercise. 6 Dazoxiben produced a highly significant reduction in both the resting and the post-exercise levels of serum thromboxane B2 levels, although there was no significant difference between the pre-exercise and post-exercise values. 7 Dazoxiben is an effective inhibitor of the synthesis of thromboxane but it has no effect on the subjective or objective features of stable coronary disease. This would suggest that the production of thromboxane and the development of circulating platelet aggregates play no part in the mechanism of angina in patients with stable coronary heart disease."
CD010438,0,12059821,0,The effects of hypertonic saline solution (7.5%) on coagulation and fibrinolysis: an in vitro assessment using thromboelastography.,"We studied the effects of hypertonic (7.5%) and normal saline on coagulation and fibrinolysis in an in vitro model using thromboelastography of human whole blood. Reaction times increased and alpha angles decreased with hypertonic saline replacement at 7.5% blood volume compared with similar dilution with normal saline. At 10% blood volume replacement with hypertonic saline, reaction and coagulation times were significantly increased and alpha angles were decreased. Clot lysis at 30 min was also significantly reduced. We conclude that 7.5% hypertonic saline solution has anticoagulant effects if it replaces 7.5% or more of blood volume."
CD010438,0,16413239,0,Recombinant human antithrombin inhibits thrombin formation and interleukin 6 release in human endotoxemia.,"We hypothesized that infusion of recombinant human antithrombin without concomitant heparin would have dose-dependent anticoagulant properties and potentially decrease endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS])-induced cytokine production. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in parallel groups enrolling 30 healthy male volunteers. The active treatment groups received infusions of recombinant human antithrombin to increase antithrombin levels to 200% and 500% before infusion of 2 ng/kg endotoxin (LPS). Infusion of antithrombin dose-dependently decreased coagulation (P < .01 by repeated-measures ANOVA): peak levels of prothrombin fragment (1.8 nmol/L [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-2.3 nmol/L] in the 500% antithrombin group and 4.4 nmol/L [95% CI, 2.7-6.2 nmol/L] in the placebo group at 4 hours), thrombin antithrombin complexes (12 microg/L [95% CI, 8-16 microg/L] in the 500% antithrombin group and 34 microg/L [95% CI, 20-48 microg/L] in the placebo group at 4 hours), and D-dimer (0.2 microg/L [95% CI, 0.1-0.2 microg/L] in the 500% antithrombin group and 0.5 microg/L [95% CI, 0.4-0.7 microg/L] in the placebo group). Recombinant human antithrombin decreased peak interleukin-6 levels by 40% (222 pg/mL [95% CI, 148-295 pg/mL] and 216 pg/mL [95% CI, 112-320 pg/mL] in the 500% and 200% antithrombin groups, respectively, versus 357 pg/mL [95% CI, 241-474 pg/mL] in the placebo group; P < .001 by ANOVA). Finally, infusion of recombinant human antithrombin rapidly and transiently decreased neutrophil counts (by 19% [95% CI, 8%-30%] in the 500% antithrombin group versus 6% [95% CI, 1%-10%] in the placebo group, P = .002 by Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) and monocyte counts (by 30% [95% CI, 16%-44%] in the 500% antithrombin group and 18% [95% CI, 9%-28%] in the 200% antithrombin group versus 8% [95% CI, 5%-20%] in the placebo group, P = .04) before LPS challenge, indicating that recombinant human antithrombin directly interacts with these leukocyte subsets. In summary, recombinant human antithrombin dose-dependently inhibited tissue factor-triggered coagulation. Effects on leukocytes and inhibition of interleukin-6 release seem to represent specific pharmacodynamic properties of recombinant human antithrombin."

We tested a Thrombelastograph (TEG) ecarin clotting time (ECT) assay for sensitivity to bivalirudin using blood from 80 patients undergoing interventional cardiology procedures with bivalirudin anticoagulation. This was compared to a standard Hemochron ACT assay using diatomaceous earth. With the TEG assay, the direct thrombin activator, ecarin, was used to initiate coagulation and measured as the reaction time. Plasma samples were evaluated for bivalirudin by a chromogenic assay at an independent hematological laboratory. Linear regression of the standard ACT versus bivalirudin level gave an r = 0.306 whereas the TEG ECT gave a much higher r2 = 0.746 (both P < 0.0001). The TEG ECT should prove more useful than the standard ACT for monitoring bivalirudin anticoagulation across the clinically therapeutic range."

Whereas gelatin has been shown not to affect coagulation besides its haemodilutional effect, hydroxyethyl starches (HES) have additional negative effects on haemostasis. The third-generation HES solutions have been developed to minimise these effects. We therefore conducted a prospective, randomised study, to verify the hypothesis that a 6% HES 130/0.42/6 : 1 and a 4% gelatin infusion influences modified thrombelastography (TEM) parameters in children in the same manner and to the same extent."
CD010438,0,15060415,0,Role of the Thrombelastograph as an adjunctive test in thrombophilia screening.,"The Thrombelastograph (TEG) provides a global assessment of haemostatic function. We have investigated the potential role of TEG in thrombophilia testing by studying 87 consecutive patients (all with personal or family history of thrombosis). For each patient, routine thrombophilia screening tests and TEG were performed in parallel. In keeping with previous reports, at least one thrombophilic trait was identified in 34% of the patients. Among those patients with previous thrombosis, the yield from screening was higher (54% with prothrombotic trait). Overall, a hypercoaguable TEG was demonstrated in 45% of patients. However, TEG and standard thrombophilia testing did not necessarily identify the same subset of individuals. Of 39 patients with hypercoaguable TEG, only 17 had a demonstrable thrombophilic trait. Conversely, of 30 patients with proven thrombophilia, 17 also had a hypercoaguable TEG. We conclude that TEG cannot be used as a sole initial screening test in patients referred for thrombophilia testing, as it fails to identify 43% of underlying thrombophilic traits. However, TEG may be a useful adjunctive test, particularly in patients in whom the regular thrombophilia screen proves unremarkable. Prospective studies are warranted to determine whether a hypercoaguable TEG can be used to predict a subset of patients at increased risk for recurrent thrombotic events."

Nitric oxide (NO) has shown to be a rapid yet temporary inhibitor of platelet function. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of NO on platelet number and function in an in vitro ECMO model. Eight silicone membrane oxygenators were primed with fresh, heparinized, bovine blood and allowed to circulate for 48 hours. The treatment group (NO) consisted of four oxygenators that had an end concentration of 20 ppm NO applied to the sweep gas. Platelet counts, methemoglobin levels, plasma-free hemoglobin levels, activated clotting times, and thromboelastographic (TEG) studies were performed at baseline, 1, 6, 12, and 24 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on sample areas from each oxygenator. The treatment group maintained an average of 25% higher platelet counts than the control group (85.1 +/- 32.0, x 10(3) versus 66.5 +/- 30.9 x 10(3)) although statistical significance was not achieved. Methemoglobin levels were significantly elevated in the treatment circuit at hours 12 and 24 (p < .05). This could be attributed to the lack of a biological interaction that would break down this toxic by-product. TEG indices steadily declined in both groups from baseline (-0.4 +/- 3.6) to (-17.2 +/- 3.3 p < .0007) treatment and (-20 +/- 4.5, p < .0001) control, with the treatment circuit maintaining only slightly improved indices over the most of the study. SEM data showed increased fibrin and cellular deposits in the control group (p = .05) when compared with the treatment group. NO added to the sweep gas of a simulated ECMO circuit at 20 ppm had little effect on the maintenance of platelet number and function."

Dynamic WB coagulation profiles were recorded by thrombelastometry employing activation with tissue factor (TF - Innovin) at low concentrations. The baseline WB coagulation patterns were characterised by a prolonged clotting time (CT) and a pronounced reduction in clot propagation (MaxVel). WB platelet aggregation signal was five times lower in the study group compared with measurements in modelled thrombocytopenic WB from healthy volunteers. In vitro addition of fresh platelets reversed the coagulopathy. Addition of rFVIIa induced no significant changes in the thrombelastographic profile, whereas spiking with NN1731 shortened the CT significantly. The changes in WB thrombin generation reflected the changes in the MaxVel. In modeled thrombocytopenic WB from healthy individuals, both rFVIIa and NN1731 exhibited a pronounced haemostatic effect with NN1731 showing greater potency than rFVIIa. Compromised platelet function in the study group was assumingly responsible for the weakened haemostatic potential of rFVIIa as well as that of NN1731."

We aimed to investigate the value of the thrombin generation assay (TGA) and thromboelastography (TEG) for monitoring haemostasis in haemophilic patients during factor replacement treatment. The study group consisted of 29 patients (21 haemophilia A, 8 haemophilia B). All the patients FVIII-inhibitor were negative. A total of 35 bleeding episodes and/or surgical interventions were evaluated. aPTT, FVIII/FIX activity, TEG and TGA tests were conducted before and after factor therapy during the bleeding episode or surgical prophylaxis of haemophilic patients. Correlations among these tests were evaluated and compared with clinical responses. No correlation was found among aPTT, factor activities and clinical outcome. There were also no correlation found between TEG parameters and clinical outcome. The only significant correlation found between TGA parameters and clinical outcome was the correlation between peak thrombin. In conclusion, we found superiority of TGA-peak thrombin over other traditional tests for monitoring haemostasis in haemophilic patients in this study."
CD010438,0,22471194,0,"Unusual manifestations in dengue outbreak 2009, Delhi, India.","Epidemics of Dengue fever (DF) and Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are common in Southeast Asia. DF is defined & classified according to WHO criteria. Variable clinical manifestations of DF & DHF have been described in earlier studies. But some patients present with unusual clinical features and clinical profile not classifiable according to the present WHO criteria. Some of these complications if not recognized early and treated properly can even prove fatal. So this study was done to describe various clinical features in Dengue fever with special emphasis on unusual manifestations. This study was conducted at University College of Medical Sciences and associated Guru Teg Bahadur hospital; a tertiary care hospital, located in East Delhi in India. It was a retrospective study of 76 patients of probable DF; including 4 cases of DHF (according to WHO classification); 60 males & 16 females above 12 years of age admitted in medical wards of Guru Teg Bahadur hospital in an outbreak of DF which occurred during September-December 2009. The data obtained was analyzed to see clinical and laboratory profile of DF/DHF with special emphasis on unusual manifestations. The mean age of the patients was 28 +/- 9.6 years. Fever was present in all the cases with an average duration of fever being 5.47 +/- 2.2 days with body ache, (84.2%), vomiting (61.8%), abdominal pain (51.3%) and headache (19.7%) being the other presenting complaints. Hemorrhagic manifestations in the form of gum bleeding and epistaxis (35.5%), positive tourniquet test (27.6%); skin rashes (15.8%), melena (15.8%) and hematemesis (5.26%) were also present. In our study a fair no of patients presented with unusual symptoms like pain in abdomen 39 (51.3%), nausea 32 (42.1%), & vomiting 47 (61.8%), which is higher than that reported previous outbreak. Of the 39 patients who presented with abdominal pain; ultrasonography of abdomen was done in 25 patients. Fifteen (38%) of these were found to have acalculous cholecystitis. Amongst the known manifestations of DF, abdominal pain has been well described, but acalculous cholecystitis as a cause of abdominal pain is scantly reported. Another unusual manifestation was the presentation of patients (7.89%) in circulatory failure without the evidence of plasma leakage and not fulfilling all the criterion proposed by WHO for DHF/DSS. All of the above patients had very low platelet counts & tourniquet test was positive in all these six patients. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were observed in 34.2% and 7.89% of cases, respectively. Renal dysfunction was observed in 13.1% of cases. Laboratory investigations revealed thrombocytopenia (with a platelet count of < 100,000/microl) in all cases. Leucopenia (WBC < 4,000/mm2) and Hemoconcentration (Hct > 20% of expected for age and sex) were found in 38% and 5.26% of the cases, respectively. Results of our study indicate that apart from usual manifestations, sometimes unusual but clinically extremely important manifestations can occur which if not detected early can prove fatal. So a vigilant and timely approach is warranted."
CD010438,0,16551923,0,Fibrinogen concentrate reverses dilutional coagulopathy induced in vitro by saline but not by hydroxyethyl starch 6%.,"Severe bleeding often induces coagulopathy via loss, consumption, and dilution of clotting factors and platelets. The aims of our in vitro study were to characterize the influence of progressive hemodilution with either NaCl 0.9% or hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 6% on blood clot formation and to analyze the effect of substitution of fibrinogen and platelets on dilutional coagulopathy. Whole blood samples drawn from 8 volunteers were diluted from 20% to 80% of the sample volume with both diluents separately. Clot formation was measured by thrombelastography. At a 60% dilution, either fibrinogen and/or platelets were added to the samples. Clot firmness became critical after 40% dilution with HES 6% but not until 60% dilution with NaCl 0.9%. When platelet function was blocked, fibrin polymerization was severely impaired after 20% dilution with HES 6%, whereas such an effect was only seen after 80% dilution with NaCl 0.9%. The addition of fibrinogen reconstituted the clot firmness in the presence of NaCl 0.9%, but this had only a minor effect after dilution with HES 6%. Platelets alone or in addition were not able to improve clot firmness to a clinically relevant extent. Dilutional coagulopathy induced by crystalloids can, in vitro, be effectively reversed by supplementation of fibrinogen. In contrast, HES molecules interfere with fibrin polymerization and, thus, administration of fibrinogen after dilution with HES 6% failed to significantly improve clot firmness."
CD010438,0,2600721,0,Management of malpositioned central venous catheters.,"Through research and clinical trials at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, central venous catheters have gained wide acceptance and are being used for an increasing number of applications. More than 30,000 patients have had a CVC placed since the inception of the M. D. Anderson program in 1976. The soft and less thrombogenic silicone elastomer catheter is the most commonly used catheter in the institution. This study found that most commonly observed malpositions are related to the puncture site and technique, venous anatomy, and catheter characteristics. The study also indicated that the majority of malpositioned central venous catheters need not be removed but can be safely repositioned using rapid flushing, patient positioning, partial withdrawal, or simple or deflective guidewire techniques. Early recognition and management of malpositioned central venous catheters not only guard against serious complications but also allow proper catheter function and prevent delay of intravenous therapy."

CD010438,0,6667245,0,Estimation of coagulation-fibrinolytic factors in DIC.,"A computer analysis of the coagulation laboratory records at the first department of Hokkaido University Hospital over a three-year period (1979-1981) was performed on 553 patients with presumptive intravascular coagulation. It is indicated that the most important diagnostic tests for DIC were Fbg, FDP, and AT III. DIC may have developed not only in patients with reduced Fbg but also in patients with normal or elevated Fbg. It is necessary to estimate the actual situations in the patients with DIC by utilizing sequential laboratory tests. In DIC, SDS-PAGE patterns of Fbg indicated the marked reduction of LMW Fbg, and the activated fibrin formation must be caused by the high affinity of thrombin for HMW Fbg. Changes in the immunoprecipitative second peak of AT III may indicate the binding of different serine proteases to AT III in DIC. Rapid and simple diagnostic tests for DIC are clinically required. An analysis of the TEG pattern using normal plasma mixed with the patient's plasma can indicate the presence of procoagulant activity in patient plasma. Such a laboratory test using TEG is the most useful and rapid diagnostic test in DIC. An anticoagulant effect of heparin therapy is determined by APTT and heparin levels. The antithrombotic effect of heparin therapy is determined by FPA as an immediate index and by Fbg, FDP, and AT III as a slow index."

CD010438,0,3590103,0,Thrombelastography of blood from subjects with chronic renal failure.,"Blood samples from 23 subjects with chronic renal failure and 19 controls were tested using thrombelastography and other hematologic tests. The uremic subjects were divided into two groups, those who had not yet begun maintenance hemodialysis treatments (12 subjects) and those who had (11 subjects). Compared to those from control subjects, the thrombelastograms from the uremic subjects consistently indicate normal clotting times but significantly elevated amplitudes. The increased amplitudes correlate positively in the dialyzed uremic group with both platelet count and fibrinogen concentration and correlate negatively in both uremic groups with hematocrit. Thrombelastography demonstrates a hypercoagulability in these samples in vitro, despite the prolonged bleeding time that commonly occurs in uremic subjects."
CD010438,0,17119964,0,Whole blood laboratory model of thrombocytopenia for use in evaluation of hemostatic interventions.,"This study describes a laboratory model of whole blood (WB) thrombocytopenia established with blood from healthy volunteers. We obtained a mean platelet count of 16 x 10(9)/l (95% confidence interval, 10-22) in WB by repeatedly replacing the platelet-rich supernatant with autologous platelet-poor plasma from the same individual. Thrombelastographic profiles of WB clot formation and WB clot stability were performed in parallel with measurements of WB platelet aggregation response. Thrombocytopenia reduced the maximum rate of WB clot formation, while ex vivo addition of platelets reversed the coagulopathy of thrombocytopenia. Control experiments revealed minimal changes in coagulation factors, distribution of bloods cells, and platelet activation capabilities. The WB model appears useful in research, development, and evaluation of the effects of hemostatic interventions in thrombocytopenia."

A poor preoperative coagulation state, decrease in levels of coagulation factors, progressive fibrinolysis, and whole blood clot lysis were observed during the preanhepatic and anhepatic stages of surgery. A further general decrease in coagulation factors and platelets, activation of fibrinolysis, and abrupt decrease in levels of factors V and VIII occurred before and with reperfusion of the homograft. Recovery of blood coagulability began 30-60 min after reperfusion of the graft liver, and coagulability had returned toward baseline values 2 hr after reperfusion. A positive correlation was shown between the variables of thrombelastography and those of the coagulation profile. Thrombelastography was shown to be a reliable and rapid monitoring system. Its use was associated with a 33% reduction of blood and fluid infusion volume, whereas blood coagulability was maintained without an increase in the number of blood product donors."

CD010438,0,811926,0,[The technique of quantitative determination of streptokinase in the patient's plasma (author's transl)].,"A method of a quantitative determination of plasma streptokinase concentrations in patients undergoing streptokinase infusion is described. The principle of this method is based on the clot lysis time recorded by the thromboelastograph. The test clot constituents were bovine fibrin, bovine plasminogen, human euglobulin, EDTA, human plasma (of unknown streptokinase quantity) and thrombin. As rather high concentrations (fixed excess) of plasminogen (euglobulin) and fibrinogen were present in the test coagulum, no interference with changing plasminogen and fibrinogen levels of the patient's plasma was observed. Furthermore, due to high EDTA concentrations, no interaction with platelet functions and coagulation factors took place. The standard deviation in measuring 2 u streptokinase in 1 ml human plasma was determined as s = +/- 0.19 u/ml, of 5 u streptokinase at s = +/- 0.47 u/ml and of 20 u streptokinase at s = +/- 2.5 u in 1 ml of human plasma. Plasma samples of patients undergoing fibrinolytic treatment were investigated with regard to their streptokinase content. Streptokinase concentration values varied between 0.7 u and 15 u/ml plasma. The average half life of streptokinase in the organism was 18 min. The decay of streptokinase in plasma at different temperatures and over various periods of time was also determined. A considerable loss of streptokinase in the plasma during storage at room temperature could be observed. Therefore, the determination procedures should be carried out without delay."

However, there still remains a lack of consensus regarding several aspects of treatment with bypassing agents such as rFVIIa, prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC), and activated PCC (aPCC). Such unresolved issues may be clarified by the identification of a suitable laboratory monitoring method with which to correlate clinical outcomes. This paper will review the need for an effective and informative monitoring strategy, and will discuss several candidate methods that have been employed for the measurement of hemostatic efficacy following therapy with bypassing agents. To date, however, no assay endpoint has been developed that can correlate accurately with clinical outcomes in a sufficiently large patient sample."

CD010438,0,19815949,0,Accelerated thrombus lysis in the blood of plasminogen activator inhibitor deficient mice is inhibited by PAI-1 with a very long half-life.,"Patients with defective plasminogen activator inhibitor protein (PAI-1) or with PAI-1 deficiency can experience hemorrhage as a result of a hyperfibrinolysis. In these patients, a normal thrombus forms, but endogenous lysis is unchecked as tissue plasminogen activator is unopposed. Treatment includes anti-fibrinolytic agents, including oral tranexamic acid. Another treatment option is the administration of PAI-1, but this serpin rapidly inactivates itself. We have developed a mutant plasminogen activator inhibitor with a very long half life (VLHL PAI-1, t1/2>700 h). Here we investigate VLHL PAI-1 effects in the blood of PAI-1 deficient mice, as a model of human disease. Using a thrombelastograph, we found that blood clots of PAI-1 knockout mice were lysed much more quickly than wild type mice. Additionally, blood clots had less shear elastic modulus strength than clots of normal animals. VLHL PAI-1 treatment of PAI-1 deficient mice extended or prevented thrombus lysis and increased clot strength in a concentration dependent fashion. These two parameters determine the extent of thrombus growth and regression; thus, further testing is anticipated to confirm the effectiveness of plasminogen activator inhibitor with a very long half life in an in vivo model and we hope that this protein can be effective in human PAI-1 deficiency disorder."

Among 26 cases with biliary tract infection 20 cases showed no bleeding tendency but remarkable hypercoagulability with decreased fibrinolytic activity. Other six cases developed diffuse bleeding tendency in addition to the signs of hypotension and multiorgan dysfunction such as oliguria, respiratory distress and mental confusion. Most showed marked coagulation defects characterized by thrombocytopenia, decreased fibrinogen, antithrombin III and plasminogen levels and narrowing of maximal amplitude in thrombelastogram as well as the increase of fibrin degradation products and positive soluble fibrin monomer complexes. All except one died and three cases were autopsied. In two cases postmortem examination revealed multiple fibrin thrombi in lungs and other organs. A cause of the development of bleeding tendency in obstructive jaundice presently observed may likely to be due to the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), i.e. hypercoagulability caused by the biliary tract infection is responsible."

We investigated evaluation of the mental state, using self-depressive scale (SDS) and the Tokyo university egogram form (TEG), of 356 asymptomatic diabetic patients (254 non-elderly, 102 elderly) admitted for educational about diabetes. On TEG, we studied evaluation of five ego states for the following showing: critical parent (CP), nurturing parent (NP), adult (A), free child (FC) and adapted child (AC). First of all, we studied evaluation of mental characteristics of the elderly, NP and A of TEG were higher in the elderly than in the non-elderly (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the SDS was lower on discharge than on admission in both groups (p < 0.01). The group showing improvement had a significantly higher SDS score on admission than the group showing aggravation (p < 0.01). We classified the group with an SDS score 50 or more SDS as the depressed group; those with a 40 to 49 score as the slight distress group; and a score of 39 or less score was considered normal. The depressed group had significantly lower A and FC, and a higher AC on TEG, than other groups (p < 0.01). Therefore, elderly diabetic patients seem to be rational and obliging.

When AT-III concentrate (4 mg/0.2 ml) was added to pregnant whole blood (0.8 ml), r(21.0 +/- 0.6 mm) and K(7.2 +/- 0.3 mm) (Mean +/- SE) were prolonged as compared with the saline control (C) (r: 18.6 +/- 0.6, K: 4.6 +/- 0.2 mm), and ma was decreased from 68.8 +/- 1.2 mm (C) to 60.3 +/- 1.0 mm (AT-III) on the TEG (p less than 0.01). PT and aPTT were also prolonged by the addition of AT-III concentrate (p less than 0.01). DIC models in rabbits were induced by continuous infusion of endotoxin (E). AT-III concentrate was administered two hours after starting infusion of E. Anticoagulant activity was evident on the TEG. In the data on coagulative and fibrinolytic factors, there were no significant differences between the control and the group administered AT-III concentrate. Fibrin deposits in the renal glomeruli were reduced after administration of AT-III concentrate (control: 46.5 +/- 38.7%, AT-III: 13.4 +/- 27.9%). The decreasing rate of AT-III antigen was the same in E infusion and non-infusion groups. However, the rate of decrease in activity was higher in the former than in the latter (rate of decrease: 40.0% and 24.6% 8 hours after administration of the AT-III concentrate). This indicated that inactive AT-III combined with thrombin and Xa might remain in the blood in DIC."

On the other side, the efficacy of these techniques over general anesthesia doesn't allow the anesthesist to miss this pratice, where possible. So it's necessary to quantify the spinal hematoma risk in patients assuming these drugs. Unfortunately, routine investigations on coagulation factors and platelets count are not reliable if patients are receiving LMWE.

For these reasons peripherical nerve block techniques are a good alternative, since they are not influenced by the efficacy of the coagulation system."

Harvesting granulocytes by filtration leukapheresis has been abandoned in most centers because of adverse reactions in both donors and recipients. Currently, both continuous and discontinuous flow centrifugation leukapheresis techniques are available. However, both corticosteroids and hydroxyethyl starch are required for optimal granulocyte collection. In this paper, we critically compare the three major cell separators used for the collection of granulocytes by centrifugation leukapheresis. All three instruments separate blood cells by centrifugation; the IBM-2997 and the Fenwal CS-3000 function by continuous-flow centrifugation, and the Haemonetics Model 30 by discontinuous-flow centrifugation. Factors such as the donor preapheresis white blood cell count, the blood flow rate through the machine and the centrifuge speed effect granulocyte collection. Comparisons will be made of the cost of the software for each machine, the time required for granulocyte collection, the convenience of set-up and tear-down, the amount of skill and experience demanded of the operator. Donor factors will be discussed. Since the blood processor may be used for other procedures including plateletpheresis, therapeutic plasma exchange, lymphocytapheresis and erthrocytapheresis, the pros and cons of each machine as used for some of these procedures will be included in the discussion. In our experience, total leukocytes and granulocytes (neutrophils) collected with the three different instruments varied only slightly when unstimulated donors were studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In general, monitoring of anticoagulant activity is not required, however, certain populations may be susceptible to overdosing or underdosing. As anti-activated factor X(anti-Xa) activity testing is not readily available, it was our aim to investigate the usefulness of thromboelastography (TEG; Haemoscope Corporation, Skokie, Illinois, USA) for the assessment of coagulation in patients on LMWH. All patients admitted to the coronary care unit on therapeutic dose of enoxaparin were included (1 mg/kg twice daily). Blood samples were collected 4 h after the morning dose of enoxaparin once the participant had received at least three doses. When anti-Xa activity was classified as low (0-0.5), correct (0.5-1.0) or high (>1.0), the distribution of reaction time (R) and dose per kg showed little association with anti-Xa activity. The difference between mean R for the high anti-Xa group and the correct anti-Xa group was statistically nonsignificant using two-sample t-test (P = 0.26). A linear regression model showed no evidence of association between dose per kg and anti-Xa (P = 0.95). However, there was evidence of positive association between dose per kg and R (P = 0.011) wherein a 10% increase in dose per kg was associated with an increase in R of 2.7 (95% confidence interval 0.6-4.7). There was no evidence of association between R and anti-Xa (P = 0.38). TEG was unable to be used to predict anti-Xa activity. However, TEG R was prolonged in more than 90% patients and correlated with dose of enoxaparin. As enoxaparin dose correlated poorly with anti-Xa activity, a more global test might be necessary to adjust dosing of LMWH in sick, hospitalized patients."

Although the time course of thrombin generation in plasma and the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) may be useful coagulation parameters, clotting involves components other than thrombin (e.g. platelets, fibrinogen). The continuous coagulation profiles of thrombelastography may provide a more accurate reflection of in vivo biology, covering initiation, development and final clot strength during whole blood clot formation. This method has helped to clarify the mechanism of action of whole blood clot formation, demonstrating the differences from clotting in plasma, and the importance of platelets and tissue factor titrations. It has also been used to investigate hypocoagulation (in haemophilia A, rare coagulation disorders, anticoagulant therapy and dilutional coagulopathy), hypercoagulation and the ex vivo testing of haemostatic interventions. Thrombelastography has been shown to reflect the clinical efficacy of activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) and recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors and in patients with acquired haemophilia. Overall, tailoring laboratory assays to illustrate and correlate with clinical phenotypes is essential for effective coagulation monitoring.

Factor XIIIA antigen, platelet counts, fibrinogen, factor V activity, tissue plasminogen activator and clot strength (by thromboelastograph) were measured at baseline, after 45 min of CPB, at the end of CPB and 4 h post-operatively in 34 patients. Baseline factor XIIIA antigen was 5.2 +/- 1.4 mg/l. On average, factor XIIIA levels dropped to 64% and clot strength to 77% of baseline values after 45 min on CPB and remained below baseline during the immediate post-operative period. Clot strength was significantly correlated (r = 0.81) with platelet count and fibrinogen but not plasma factor XIIIA levels. Addition of 10 mg/l recombinant factor XIII[a2] significantly increased clot strength. Postoperative bleeding at 2 h was inversely correlated with platelet count, factor XIIIA antigen and clot strength measured at the end of CPB.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of achievable epidural concentrations of lidocaine on blood coagulation as a step in testing this hypothesis. Ex vivo blood coagulation using whole blood (n = 20) was studied with computerized thrombelastography (TEG). Each blood specimen was exposed to serial dilutions of lidocaine hydrochloride or saline to form end-concentrations of 0.0 mM, 2.3 mM, 4.6 mM, 9.2 mM, 18.5 mM, and 36.9 mM lidocaine. Statistical analysis using analysis of variance for repeated measures revealed that the three highest lidocaine concentrations tested caused hypocoagulable and/or fibrinolytic changes as compared with controls. Achievable epidural admixtures of lidocaine and whole blood will impair coagulation. Therefore, residual lidocaine in the epidural space may contribute to failures of immediate or early EBP."

CD010438,0,19489008,0,The design and testing of a dual fiber textile matrix for accelerating surface hemostasis.,"The standard treatment for severe traumatic injury is frequently compression and application of gauze dressing to the site of hemorrhage. However, while able to rapidly absorb pools of shed blood, gauze fails to provide strong surface (topical) hemostasis. The result can be excess hemorrhage-related morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that cost-effective materials (based on widespread availability of bulk fibers for other commercial uses) could be designed based on fundamental hemostatic principles to partially emulate the wicking properties of gauze while concurrently stimulating superior hemostasis. A panel of readily available textile fibers was screened for the ability to activate platelets and the intrinsic coagulation cascade in vitro. Type E continuous filament glass and a specialty rayon fiber were identified from the material panel as accelerators of hemostatic reactions and were custom woven to produce a dual fiber textile bandage. The glass component strongly activated platelets while the specialty rayon agglutinated red blood cells. In comparison with gauze in vitro, the dual fiber textile significantly enhanced the rate of thrombin generation, clot generation as measured by thromboelastography, adhesive protein adsorption and cellular attachment and activation. These results indicate that hemostatic textiles can be designed that mimic gauze in form but surpass gauze in ability to accelerate hemostatic reactions."

To search for mutations in F10 gene giving rise to severe FX deficiency and to study the contribution of thrombin generation and thromboelastometry as a tool for evaluation of hemostasis. Mutations in the F10 gene were sought by direct sequencing of all the eight exons and intron/exon boundaries. Thrombin generation and thromboelastometry were performed. Three unrelated Palestinian patients had undetectable FX level (<1 U/dl). All patients were found to be homozygous for c302delG, a new frameshift mutation in the F10 gene causing a stop codon at amino acid 73. The mutant allele was not detected among 152 Palestinians analyzed. Thrombin generation was examined in one of the patients 4 days after fresh frozen plasma was applied, when his FX level was 2 U/dl. Minute thrombin generation was observed, as compared to normal thrombin generation in heterozygotes for the mutation and a healthy control. Thromboelastometry revealed prolonged lag phase when patient's platelet-poor plasma and platelet-rich plasma were tested, with a slightly decreased initial clot formation rate, as compared to carriers' and control sample. Genetic analysis disclosed a unique mutation causing a severe phenotype. Thrombin generation assay may serve as a quick tool for confirming severe deficiency until the specific mutation is identified. Thrombin generation can also serve for monitoring and optimizing treatment. The correlation of thromboelastometry assay and severe FX deficiency is less striking."
CD010438,0,16684000,0,New approaches for measuring coagulation.,"Although specific assays of coagulation factors are essential for diagnostic purposes they only give partial information about an individual's haemostatic state. This can be better assessed by various global tests, and recent developments and evaluations of five such tests are described in this symposium: the PFA-100; waveform analysis; thrombin generation; overall haemostasis potential; thrombelastography. Each test has advantages in various applications, but the thrombin generation test and waveform analysis have been found most useful in haemophilia, whilst the PFA-100 is helpful in von Willebrand's disease."

CD010438,0,2901880,0,Concentration of bone marrow progenitor cells by separation on a Percoll gradient using the Haemonetics model 30.,"To perform an optimal ex vivo bone marrow purge, it is necessary to concentrate the bone marrow progenitor cells and to eliminate both the red blood cells and the polymorphonuclear leucocytes. To achieve this goal which cannot be accomplished by using the Haemonetics model 30 alone, we used the Haemonetics model 30 and a density gradient together in a two-step procedure. In the first step we obtained the buffy coat from original bone marrow grafts and in the second we reintroduced these buffy coats into the Haemonetics bowl followed by Percoll, adjusted to 1.079 g/ml, at 5 ml/min in order to recover the light density mononuclear cells. After this second step, the mean volume of the marrow and the RBC and nucleated cell contaminations were reduced to 9%, 0.96% and 16% of their original values the unseparated bone marrow, respectively. This was far better than the values obtained after the first step (volume: 19%; RBC: 10%; nucleated cells: 54%). The CFU-GM recoveries after the first and second steps were 71% and 70% of the original samples, respectively. The entire procedure lasted between 75 and 150 min. At this time, 17 of the 24 patients whose bone marrow was separated using Percoll gradient in the Haemonetics bowl have been grafted. Thirteen of these 17 patients had an evaluable haematological recovery which was complete and rapid for all but one patient with acute myeloid leukaemia. These results demonstrate that the introduction of a density gradient into the Haemonetics model 30 bowl is possible and effective. The reduction in total volume and cell number permits ex vivo purging, without decreasing the grafting capability."

The aim of our work was to test the possibility of preparing PC routinely from normal plasma donors in a minimum amount of time and, at the same time, providing a second product that can be used as source-plasma or fresh-frozen plasma. Over a 3 year period (from 1990 to 1992) we performed 3503 procedures using 2 Haemonetics PCS machines (1236 procedures) and 3 Autopheresis-C (2267 procedures). With the PC produced we were able to satisfy all the requests coming from the hospitals of our region. The platelet yield was 1.95 x 10(11) with PCS and 3.2 x 10(11) with Auto-C in a PC volume of 150 and 200 ml respectively; collection times were quite similar (56 and 63 min). The results show that plasma-plateletpheresis is an efficient and competitive system. Regarding platelet yield, the best results were obtained with the Auto-C."

Antimicrobial activities of TEG-carbenicillin tested against gram-negative Escherichia coli (TG-1) and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-12228) and Bacillus subtilis (NA-1) were comparable to that of carbenicillin. Stability of the beta-lactam ring of TEG-carbenicillin was determined by iodometry at pH 6.8, pH 4.5, and pH 2.0 at varied time intervals and was compared to that of carbenicillin. In 26 hr, both of the compounds were stable at pH 6.8. At pH 4.5, about 41% of the carbenicillin was decomposed, while TEG-carbenicillin was not appreciably decomposed. At pH 2.0, carbenicillin was decomposed about 61% after 6 hr, while TEG-carbenicillin was decomposed about 21% during the same period."
CD010438,0,11292193,0,Global anticoagulant effects of a novel sulfated pentomanan oligosaccharide mixture.,"PI-88 is a potent antiproliferative agent, which is developed for various indications in cancer. This agent is obtained from yeast fermentation and is primarily composed of pentamannose and tetramannose oligosaccharide units. PI-88 is capable of producing anticoagulant effects, which are mediated by heparin cofactor II. The purpose of this study was to determine the anticoagulant properties of PI-88 in native whole blood, freshly drawn from human volunteers, supplemented with PI-88 at various concentrations (0-100 microg/mL). Whole blood activated clotting time (ACT) was measured using Hemochron instruments. PI-88 produced a strong anticoagulant effect at 100 microg/mL (479.0+/-59.5 sec). This anticoagulant effect was comparable to that observed in interventional cardiology and open-heart surgery. At the lower level, PI-88 produced concentration-dependent effects on ACT. Using thromboelastographic techniques (TEG), the effect of PI-88 was measured in terms of various parameters. PI-88 produced potent anticoagulant effects in the TEG studies. At the concentration of 25 microg/mL, it produced a complete anticoagulant effect in whole blood. Whole blood samples supplemented with PI-88 showed a concentration-dependent decrease in the generation of various markers of clotting activation. These results clearly suggest that PI-88 exerts an anticoagulant effect in whole blood. Because of the low-molecular-weight nature and a novel mechanism of action, this new drug may be considered for further development, particularly in cancer patients."

CD010438,0,494571,0,The utilisation of a new strength citrate anticoagulant during centrifugal plateletpheresis. III. Assessment of in vitro platelet metabolism.,"Employing the Haemonetics Blood Processor (IFC), a relatively pure platelet concentrate can be prepared by collecting only the first portion of the PRP leaving the centrifuge bowl (Fraction I). A subsequent fraction containing RBC and WBC contaminants (Fraction II) can be purified by means of a second centrifugation, using a conventional blood bank centrifuge (Fraction II), if transfusion of these contaminants would be detrimental to the recipient. Utilising the new 1.4% Na3-citrate anticoagulant, platelet metabolic parameters (ATP, ADP, AMP, lactate and pyruvate) as well as O2-uptake, were determined in Fraction I and II prepared from 10 normal healthy subjects. In contrast to previous studies reporting marked dysfunction in platelets contained in Fraction II when standard ACD-A was used during IFC, we observed no significant difference (Student's t test) in the present study between Fractions I and II, in regard to platelet metabolism, when using the new anticoagulant. It is further concluded that the second centrifugal manipulation does not exert a detrimental effect on platelet metabolism."

However, neither of them significantly influence the conventional clotting tests. We compared the influence of clinically relevant concentrations of fondaparinux and enoxaparin on normal whole blood (WB) thromboelastographic profiles after triggering TF-pathway with minimal amount of thromboplastin. Diluted thromboplastin was added to WB samples supplemented with buffer (control), fondaparinux (0.25; 0.5; 1 microg/ml), or enoxaparin (0.1; 0.5; 1 anti-Xa IU/ml). Four parameters were analyzed, R: clotting time, K: time required to reach an amplitude of 20 mm, alpha angle: measurement reflecting clot development kinetics and MA: maximal amplitude. At concentrations used in prophylaxis, both enoxaparin (0.1 anti-Xa IU/ml) and fondaparinux (0.25 microg/ml which correspond to 0.27 anti-Xa IU/ml) significantly prolonged the R and K times, but did not significantly modify the alpha angle as compared to the control. At concentrations observed after administration of curative doses for the treatment of DVT (> or = 0.5 anti-Xa IU/ml for enoxaparin and > or = 0.5 microg/ml for fondaparinux) both drugs induced a significant increase of R and K times, and a significant decrease of the alpha angle (p < 0.05). In contrast to fondaparinux, enoxaparin at concentrations equal to or higher than 0.5 anti-Xa IU/ml significantly reduced MA. The present study provides evidence that the whole blood TF-triggered TEG assay is sensitive to the presence of clinically relevant concentrations of enoxaparin or fondaparinux. Moreover, the angle may be used in order to distinguish the effect of prophylactic and therapeutic concentrations, since it was significantly reduced by the later ones. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of whole blood TF-triggered TEG assay for the monitoring of treatment with enoxaparin or fondaparinux."

CD010438,0,22805300,0,The FIB-PPH trial: fibrinogen concentrate as initial treatment for postpartum haemorrhage: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,"Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) remains a leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. In Denmark 2% of parturients receive blood transfusion. During the course of bleeding fibrinogen (coagulation factor I) may be depleted and fall to critically low levels, impairing haemostasis and thus worsening the ongoing bleeding. A plasma level of fibrinogen below 2 g/L in the early phase of postpartum haemorrhage is associated with subsequent development of severe haemorrhage. Use of fibrinogen concentrate allows high-dose substitution without the need for blood type crossmatch. So far no publications of randomised controlled trials involving acutely bleeding patients in the obstetrical setting have been published. This trial aims to investigate if early treatment with fibrinogen concentrate reduces the need for blood transfusion in women suffering severe PPH."

As a first step, we focused on the following three psychosocial aspects: ego state, behavioral pattern, and mood state which were considered to be closely related to mental state. To evaluate these parameters, we selected three established self-rating questionnaires: the Tokyo University Egogram for ego state, the Time Structuring Scale for behavioral pattern, and the Profile of Mood States for mood state. The combination of these three questionnaires was applied on 300 healthy company employees and school teachers (170 males and 130 females). Five ego-state factors (Critical Parents, Nurturing Parents, Adult, Free Child, and Adapted Child), five behavioral pattern factors (Withdrawal, Rituals and Pastimes, Activities, Intimacy, and Games), and six mood state factors (Tension-Anxiety, Depression-Dejection, Anger-Hostility, Vigor-Activity, Fatigue-Inertia, and Confusion-Bewilderment) were scored. Of 85 correlations between test factors, 49 in males and 61 in females were not significant, indicating that each test in this battery assessed aspects of mental state rather independent of those assessed by the others. However, significant correlations (P < 0.05) were observed for remaining pairs of test factors, indicating that these three parameters were also interrelated with each other, indicating that mental state could be elucidated more comprehensively by assessing all three psychosocial parameters than by assessing only one. The possibility that this battery could be used in the future in worksite health promotion programs is discussed."
CD010438,0,20596697,0,Aptamer sandwich assays: human α-thrombin detection using liposome enhancement.,"Fluorescent dye-encapsulating liposomes tagged with aptamers were developed and used as reporting signals in an aptamer-based sandwich assay. α-Thrombin was utilized as a prototypical analyte as two well-studied aptamers binding distinct epitopes are available to form a sandwich complex. Cholesteryl-TEG-modified aptamers were embedded into the liposomal lipid bilayer while the interior cavity of the liposomes encapsulated fluorescent sulforhodamine B dye. Such liposomes successfully formed a sandwich complex with α-thrombin and a microtiter plate immobilized aptamer, proving that aptamers retain their ability to fold when anchored to the liposome surface. Parameters studied included liposomal aptamer coverage, sandwich aptamer orientation, aptamer label orientation, aptamer spacer length and type, incubation buffer, and aptamer concentration. The optimized conditions found here in the fluorescence assay led to a limit of detection of 64 pM or 2.35 ng/mL, corresponding to 6.4 fmol or 235 pg, respectively, in a 100 μL volume. This is an order of magnitude lower than previous sandwich aptamer assays using the same sequences with lowest reported limits of detection of 0.45 nM. In addition, the assay was applied successfully to the detection of α-thrombin in human plasma. The success of this method in a standard microtiter plate format and the relatively facile functionalization of liposomes with aptamers suggest that this approach provides a versatile option for routine analytical applications."
CD010438,0,3218723,0,[Haptoglobin determination in the serum of patients following intraoperative autotransfusion using the Haemonetics Cell Saver III. Studies on the loading of patients with free hemoglobin in retransfused erythrocyte concentrate].,"In addition to hemodilution, mechanical intraoperative autotransfusion (IAT) is the most important method of preventing or minimizing the transfusion of homologous blood in operations with major blood loss. Most of the problems associated with IAT could be solved by the use of cell separators, but the separated red blood cells still contain an average of 200 mg/dl free hemoglobin. By the determination of haptoglobin levels before and after IAT, we studied the effects of free hemoglobin on the patient. Seventy-seven patients with hip-joint replacement were studied. In one group, n = 47, both intraoperative blood loss and drainage blood (for 6 h post-operatively) were collected and transfused back to the patient after cell separation with the Haemonetics Cell-Saver III as a red-cell concentrate. A second group, n = 34, received only homologous blood. Serum haptoglobin was determined after anesthesia induction and after the last transfusion on the day of operation. There were no significant differences in preoperative haptoglobin levels between both groups. In the IAT group, haptoglobin was significantly lower then in the control group after transfusion (t-test, P = 0.05). In both groups 14% of the patients' haptoglobin levels were pathologic preoperatively. Post-transfusion 60% of the IAT group showed minimum levels while in another 14% no haptoglobin could be measured. In these 14%, free hemoglobin was circulating in the patients' blood because the transport capacity was exhausted. In the control group only 26.5% of the haptoglobin levels were below normal and in no case was transport capacity exhausted (Table 3). The correlation between volume of retransfused autologous blood and decrease in haptoglobin level was small (r = 0.15). In a few cases with low volumes of retransfused blood the haptoglobin decrease may have been greater, so that free hemoglobin may have been present."

A new program for the concurrent collection of platelets (PLTs) and red blood cells (RBCs) was evaluated in a prospective study. Apheresis donors ( n=18) underwent concurrent collection of PLTs and RBCs using the Haemonetics MCS+ blood cell separator. Aliquots of PLTs and RBCs were collected during five to six passes of the discontinuous flow procedure. The platelet product was in-line filtered during the last pass of the separation procedure. After collection, saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM) preservative solution was automatically added to the RBCs. Thereafter, the RBCs were in-line leukodepleted by gravity filtration at room temperature. The PLTs and RBCs were subsequently stored at 22+/-2 degrees C for 5 days and 4+/-2 degrees C for 35 days, respectively. The following in vitro parameters were evaluated over the storage periods: blood cell counts, glucose, lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, pH, plasma hemoglobin, and potassium. Two ready-to-use blood components from one donor were collected in an average procedure time of 86+/-10 min; 2.47+/-0.74 x 10(11) PLTs were collected in a product volume of 232+/-43 ml. The RBC volume averaged 280+/-20 ml and the hemoglobin content was 56.8+/-2.4 g per unit.

There are very limited data correlating coagulation tests with postoperative bleeding. We evaluated coagulation changes after CPB and after the administration of coagulation products to 75 children. Baseline coagulation tests were obtained and repeated after protamine administration, after transfusion of individual coagulation products, and on arrival in the intensive care unit (ICU). Regression analysis demonstrated no baseline coagulation test to predict postoperative chest tube drainage. Weight and duration of CPB were determined to be the only predictors of bleeding. Further analyses demonstrated that children <8 kg had more bleeding and required more coagulation products than children >8 kg. Postprotamine platelet count and fibrinogen level correlated independently with 24-h chest tube drainage in children <8 kg, whereas postprotamine platelet count and thrombelastographic values did so in patients weighing >8 kg. Platelet administration alone was found to restore effective hemostasis in many patients. With ongoing bleeding, cryoprecipitate improved coagulation parameters and limited blood loss. Fresh-frozen plasma administration after platelets worsened coagulation parameters and was associated with greater chest tube drainage and more coagulation product transfusions in the ICU. Objective data to guide post-CPB component therapy transfusion in children are suggested."
CD010438,0,22435277,0,Contemporary anesthesia management for liver transplantation: a comparison of American and European methods.,"This review article compares the organization of liver transplantation programs, anesthesia management and postoperative care in the United States and Europe. Liver transplantation is a definitive treatment for end-stage liver disease. The procedure is extremely complex and requires excellent surgical technique and experienced anesthesiologists who are able to provide precise management. Liver transplantation programs, which first started in the United States and a few years later in Europe, have quickly been able to achieve remarkable results. In the United States one organization, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) is responsible for the allocation of organs and data collection; in Europe there are various organizations with different levels of cooperation. The major difference between anesthesia management in the United States and Europe is the number of medications available for coagulation improvement. Substances such as prothrombin complex concentrate, fibrinogen, and antithrombin III allow for a greater flexibility in European anesthesia management. Thromboelastography, which is routinely used in the United States for overseeing coagulation, is now increasingly being used in Europe, and seems to be highly effective in providing precise information about coagulation. The overall ICU stay in Europe is longer than in the United States, and services such as maintenance of critical care, immunosuppression and nutrition are not separated in Europe. Despite these differences in liver transplantation programs, overall one-year patient survival rate is similar in the United States and in Europe, exceeding 85% in both."

CD010438,0,20087172,0,Determination of enoxaparin with rotational thrombelastometry using the prothrombinase-induced clotting time reagent.,"Drug monitoring of low molecular weight heparin is generally not recommended, but could be reasonable in critically ill patients, whose risk for bleeding or thrombosis shows a high interpatient variability. Anti-Xa assays are not available around the clock even in central hospitals, whereas rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) becomes increasingly used at the bedside. Prothrombinase-induced clotting time (PiCT) reagent allows determination of factor Xa-inhibition in plasma. The aim of our study was to evaluate enoxaparin determination in whole blood with the ROTEM using specific test modifications, including PiCT. After ethics committee's approval, citrated whole blood obtained from overall 16 healthy volunteers was incubated with enoxaparin at 16 different anti-Xa concentrations. Main endpoint was the clotting time (CT) in ROTEM representing initial activation of clot formation. CT was determined in the new PiCT-ROTEM test, in a low-tissue factor-activated modification (LowTF-ROTEM) as well as in the commercially available heparin-sensitive ROTEM assays (HEPTEM and INTEM). In the absence of enoxaparin, CT values were 168.6 +/- 6.1 s (PiCT-ROTEM), 247.3 +/- 18.6 s (LowTF-ROTEM), and -6.2 +/- 7.9 s (INTEM-HEPTEM). A linear dependency (P < 0.01) between anti-Xa concentration and CT was found for PiCT-ROTEM, LowTF-ROTEM, and for INTEM-HEPTEM with correlation coefficients of 0.93 for PiCT-ROTEM, 0.94 for LowTF-ROTEM, and 0.81 for INTEM-HEPTEM. This in-vitro experiment demonstrates a strong correlation between enoxaparin anti-Xa concentrations and specific ROTEM tests. These promising assays should be further evaluated for monitoring anticoagulation in high-risk patients in clinical studies."

We will also evaluate in vitro the influence of clinically available drugs with a noncompetitive inhibitory effect on PLA2 on the anticoagulant effect of bee venom PLA2. Prothrombin index (PTi), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), antithrombin III (AT III), soluble fibrin monomers (SFM), the activity of coagulation factors I, II, V, and VIII, and thrombelastography (TEG) parameters (split point [Sp], reaction time [R], kinetic time [K], coagulation time [R + K], maximal amplitude [MA], and the growth angle [alpha]) were determined before and after addition of 1.4, 2.7, and 4.1 units (1, 2, and 3 microg protein respectively) of bee venom PLA2. Linear regression was used to determine the significance of the relationship between these coagulation parameters and bee venom PLA2 concentrations used. To study the influence of ketamine, lidocaine, magnesium, furosemide, and cromolyn on the anticoagulant effect of bee venom PLA2, PTi and factor II- and V-activities were measured before and after addition of 2.7 units of PLA2 and PLA2 plus one of the tested substances. Determinations of F II, PTi, F V, and F VIII showed a negative correlation to bee venom PLA2 concentration (r = -0.88, -0.86, -0.81, and -0.79 respectively). A positive correlation was found for PTT (r = 0.69). FII- activity and PTi correlated better with bee venom PLA2 concentration than other parameters. F I, AT III, and SFM showed no changes. Whereas Sp, R, and K were prolonged by bee venom PLA2 and a was reduced, there was no correlation to the PLA2 concentration. Addition of none of the 5 substances could correct the effects of bee venom PLA2 on the coagulation. In a patient with toxic reaction or a severe anaphylactic reaction after bee sting(s) we suggest determinations of FII and/or PTi. This will allow a quick and economical assessment of coagulation abnormalities after bee sting(s). Noncompetitive PLA2-inhibitors (ketamine, lidocaine, magnesium, furosemide, and cromolyn) are unable to correct in vitro the anticoagulant effect of bee venom PLA2. They cannot be recommended at this stage for this purpose. Further investigations with competitive PLA2-inhibitors are warranted."

In 1995 the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services selected the School of Medical Education at the University of New South Wales to conduct a national project to reduce discrimination related to blood-borne viruses within dental services (Godwin, Meihubers & Rotem 1997). This paper provides an overview of the study and its major findings. The study focused on quality of care issues which may cause or manifest discrimination. Key stakeholders were invited to review policies, procedures, organisational arrangements and other systemic issues which influence the quality of oral health services to populations within selected geographical regions."
CD010438,0,3354042,0,Density gradient isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells using a blood cell processor.,"Large numbers of mononuclear cells (MNC) are needed for hematologic reconstitution using peripheral blood stem cells. The possibility of isolating those cells by discontinuous Ficoll-diatrizoate density gradient centrifugation in two blood cell processors (the Haemonetics V50 [V50] and the Cobe 2991 [2991]) were examined. Buffy coats from peripheral blood containing 6.23 X 10(8) MNC were separated in the V50, resulting in a recovery of 75 percent. The purity of the cells, defined as the percentage of lymphocytes and monocytes among all leukocytes, was 95 percent. With larger cell loads (3 to 7 X 10(9) MNC), the yield was higher in the V50 than in the Cobe 2991 (92 versus 75%). After separation in the V50 or the 2991, the cloning efficiencies of hematopoietic progenitor cells (CFU-GM and BFUe) were not different from those of cells isolated on 5 ml Ficoll-diatrizoate gradients in centrifuge tubes. Both leukapheresis and MNC separation can be carried out with the same bowl and tubing set in the V50. With that approach, an average of 6 X 10(9) MNC were processed in 16 experiments. An average recovery of 82 percent with 95 percent purity was achieved. The authors conclude that, in terms of simplicity of operation, cost effectiveness, and maintenance of sterility, the V50 may be better suited than the 2991 for the purification of MNC from peripheral blood."

Rubomycin was used in the treatment of patients with acute leukemia Adriamycin and carminomycin were used in the treatment of patients with solid tumors. The antibiotics affected the process of blood coagulation mainly through their cytostatic effect on thrombocytopoesis. Thrombocytopenia induced deficit of thrombocytal factors participating in the process of blood coagulation which resulted in hypocoagulation and hemorrhagic complications. The plasmic factors did not significantly change during the antibiotic therapy. A tendency to decrease in the levels of prothrombine, fibrinase and fibrinogen was noted which was possible due to an inhibitory effect of the antibiotics on the function of the reticuloendothelial tissue cells or indirectly to suppression of the tumor process. More pronounced changes in the system of blood coagulation of patients treated with rubomycin were probably associated with inferiority of the thrombocytal apparatus of the patients with acute leukemia treated with the antibiotic."

To this end, wall-to-wall polymerization contraction gap width of a resin composite in a cylindrical dentin cavity and shear bond strength to a flat dentin surface were measured. Dentin was pretreated with an experimental dentin bonding system - consisting of 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid conditioner, TEG or TEGMA primer, and Clearfil Photo Bond bonding agent - prior to resin composite filling. When the cavity was primed with an aqueous solution of 35 vol% TEG, 35 or 45 vol% TEGMA for a few seconds, contraction gap formation was prevented completely. Then, among these three gap-free groups, there were no significant differences in shear bond strength. It was thus shown that both TEG and TEGMA were highly effective dentin primers, completely preventing contraction gap formation even when they were applied for only a few seconds."

ART-123 at a dose of 0.3 mg was administered as a bolus intravenous injection for 1 minute. Plasma ART-123 concentration and prothrombinase activity were determined before and immediately, 24, and 48 hours after injection, and thromboelastography was recorded before and immediately and 24 hours after injection. The mean elimination half-life was 19.82 +/- 2.10 hours. Compared with pretreatment levels, ART-123 reduced prothrombinase activity by 44.2 +/- 11.7%, 52.1 +/- 10.8%, and 61.0 +/- 14.7%, respectively, immediately, 24, and 48 hours after injection, suggesting that ART-123 activated the protein C pathway. ART-123 did not affect thromboelastography values. There were no abnormal findings for objective signs or laboratory tests, including blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, body temperature, hematology, coagulation and hemostatic parameters, blood chemistry, and urinalysis. Based on these observations, ART-123 at a dose of 0.3 mg can activate the protein C pathway in healthy volunteers."

Platelet aggregation in the Chandler's tube has been found to be increased in a group of normal male and female volunteers who undertook strenuous physical exercise. This coincided with acceleration of the ;intrinsic' blood clotting system and a rise in fibrinogen. The rise in fibrinogen occurred despite increased fibrinolysis.2. The study confirms the sensitivity of the platelet aggregation system to changes in the ;intrinsic' clotting mechanism. Acceleration of this system in this study resulted from a physiological cause and produced accelerated aggregation in the coagulation-affected phase.
CD010438,0,20970652,0,Considerations regarding major bleeding after cardiac transplantation.,"Postoperative bleeding is one of the most frequent complications after cardiac surgery, leading to longer stays in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the hospital as well as increased morbidity and mortality. We designed an observational prospective study to evaluate early complications after cardiac transplantation, focusing on major bleeding and transfusion requirements. We also evaluated whether massive transfusion was related to increased morbidity and mortality. In patients who received ≥6 blood units, we observed significant differences regarding the need for continuous renal replacement techniques (50% vs 12.5%; P=.01) and ICU mortality (33.3% vs 4%; P=.01). This difference in mortality was also observed when comparing plasma transfusion requirements (35.3% vs 9.4%; P=.04). The overall mortality rate was 24.50%, showing significant differences in patients with massive transfusion (83.3% vs 37.8%; P=.008). In conclusion, perioperative bleeding and massive transfusion were associated with increased morbidity and mortality in this group of patients, which may prompt a review of surgical procedures and the introduction of new techniques, such as thromboelastography."

We have performed TF-activated thromboelastograms in 250 children <2 yr old undergoing cardiac surgery to establish baseline values. Five groups were distinguished to evaluate the effects of quantitative deficiencies in coagulation factor levels during infancy: <30 days, 1-3 mo, 3-6 mo, 6-12 mo, and 12-24 mo. Activation of clotting (R and K values) was similar among groups. Infants 1-3 mo of age demonstrated increased clot strength compared with the other groups, a finding similar to previous evaluation of native thromboelastograms. The alpha and maximum amplitude values were numerically almost identical in each age group, a unique finding in activated thromboelastograms. Fibrinolysis was similar among groups. We believe that knowledge of baseline TF-activated thromboelastogram variables in young children will be useful in interpreting these thromboelastograms in clinical scenarios, in using these thromboelastograms as part of coagulopathy treatment algorithms, and during the application of more specific thromboelastogram modifiers. Additionally, the similarity of alpha and maximum amplitude values in each age group will allow even faster interpretation of thromboelastogram data."
CD010438,0,20435346,0,"The influence of poly-N-[(2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane)methyl]acrylamide on fibrin polymerization, cross-linking and clot structure.","Poly-N-[(2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane)methyl]acrylamide (PDMDOMA) is a neutral synthetic water-soluble polymer. In this report, we evaluated the influence of PDMDOMA on blood hemostasis by studying the fibrin polymerization process, the three-dimensional clot structure, and the mechanical properties and fibrinolysis. PDMDOMA altered the normal fibrin polymerization by changing the rate of protofibril aggregation and resulting in a 5-fold increase in the overall turbidity. Fibrin clots formed in presence of PDMDOMA exhibited thinner fibers with less branching which resulted in a more porous and heterogeneous clot structure in scanning electron micrographs. The overall strength and rigidity of the whole blood clot also decreased up to 10-fold. When a combination of plasminogen and tissue-plasminogen activators were included in clotting reactions, fibrin clots formed in the presence of PDMDOMA exhibited highly shortened clot lysis times and was supported by the enhanced clot lysis measured by thromboelastography in whole blood. Further evidence of the altered clot structure and clot cross-linking was obtained from the significant decrease in d-dimer levels measured from degraded plasma clot. Thus, PDMDOMA may play an important role as an antithrombotic agent useful in prophylactic treatments for thrombosis by modulating fibrin clot structure to enhance fibrinolysis."

CD010438,0,20943250,0,Phytoremediation of ethylene glycol and its derivatives by the burhead plant (Echinodorus cordifolius (L.)): effect of molecular size.,"Ethylene glycol (EG) is a group of dihydroxy alcohol that has been utilised in a variety of industrial and residential settings. EG contaminated wastewater has a high chemical oxygen demand (COD), which causes environmental problems. The aim of this research was to investigate the efficiency of the burhead plant (Echinodorus cordifolius (L.)) in the removal of mono-, di- and triethylene glycol (MEG, DEG and TEG), the first three members of the dihydroxy alcohol group, from synthetic wastewaters, to examine the toxic effect of EG on the plant and to identify differences among MEG, DEG, and TEG removal. It was found that the COD of synthetic wastewaters decreased to levels below the standard effluent (COD=120 mg L⁻¹) on day 18, 21 and 33 for MEG, DEG and TEG, respectively. On day 18 of the experiment, the burhead plant removed approximately 2000, 1950 and 730 mg L⁻¹ of MEG, DEG and TEG, respectively. The removal rate of MEG was faster than that of DEG and TEG, suggesting that the molecular size of the EG had affected its rate of removal. The concentrations of MEG, DEG, and TEG in plant tissue were measured to show that burhead can take up EG, and the major site of EG accumulation is the leaf. The molar of MEG that was taken up into the plant leaf was higher than that of DEG and TEG. This suggested that EG of smaller molecular sizes can be taken up more rapidly by the plant than EG of larger molecular sizes. EG concentrations in the leaf increased to a peak concentration and then slowly decreased. GC-MS analysis of DEG-treated plant tissue found MEG, 1,4-dioxan-2-one, neophytadiene, and 2-propenamide, that may be DEG-degradation products and/or compounds that are induced when plants are exposed to DEG. The result indicates that burhead can potentially be used for EG removal."

In this in vitro study, we compared the infusion and warming capabilities of the L-1 (model 1000) versus the RIS using pediatric- and adult-sized IV catheters. The time to infuse 2 L of lactated Ringer's solution and the end temperature after infusion through 20-, 18-, 16-, and 14-gauge catheters, and 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8.5-French catheters using both the L-1 and RIS were measured. The flow rates of both systems were similar for 18- and 20-gauge catheters; however, the flow rates with the RIS were progressively faster than the L-1 as catheter size increased to >18 gauge. The heating capabilities of the RIS were superior to the L-1 for all catheters >or=16 gauge. We conclude that the RIS was superior to the L-1 for both flow rates and warming capacity for all IV catheters >18 gauge, i.e., those used for cases with massive blood loss. The RIS provided no advantage (with regard to heating and flow) when used with typical pediatric-sized catheters."

The herbal medicines were taken by oral and enema. The course of treatment was 6 weeks. The length, wet and dry weights of thrombus, the platelet adherence and the r, k, Ma, M values of thrombelastogram were measured before and after medications. Before medication, the value mentioned above were all abnormal in both YH and YJQQ group. After medication, with alleviation of the symptoms and signs of the colitis, all these values trend gradually to normal levels (P less than 0.01). The rat models of ulcerative colitis were made by immunological and local stimulation methods. The models were divided into three groups: YH(I), YJQQ(II) and water group(III). Three weeks after medication, the results showed that the lesion degree of the colon, the length and weight both wet and dry thrombus were remarkably lower in group I than those in group III. It was also showed that there was a positive correlation between the lesion degree of colon and the dry weight of thrombus (r = 0.7941, P less than 0.01).

An initial epidemiological study surprisingly showed that plasmas of 5-10% of healthy blood donors had an impaired potential to activate scuPA. Analysis of the respective genomic DNAs revealed one particular single nucleotide polymorphism of FSAP resulting in an identical amino acid exchange (G511E), which correlates with the reduced activities. The corresponding mutation was named FSAP Marburg I. Thrombelastographies of wild-type and mutant plasmas were performed, facilitating the auto-activation of the intrinsic FSAP pro-enzymes by addition of dextran sulfate (DXS) and accelerated clot lysis by addition of scuPA. On these conditions, tissue-factor-induced coagulation revealed that clot lysis was significantly delayed in the Marburg I mutant plasmas as compared with wild-type plasmas. Furthermore, in the presence of DXS and scuPA, a FSAP-deficient plasma revealed significantly prolonged plasma clot lysis times, whereas the addition of purified FSAP pro-enzyme plus scuPA reversed this effect. These results support the hypothesis that FSAP contributes to the scuPA-dependent plasma fibrinolytic potential, which can be impaired in plasmas containing the FSAP Marburg I polymorphism, for instance."

The mechanism has never been established. We have conducted an in vitro study to determine whether the effect can be moderated or prevented when the reduction in antithrombin III caused by dilution is prevented by supplementation. Blood from 20 volunteers was divided into four samples. One sample was not diluted and served as control (C). Another was diluted (by 20%) with saline (S). The third was diluted by 20% with saline plus two units of antithrombin (AT III) (SA). The fourth remained undiluted, with two units of added AT III (CA). Coagulation was measured in all four samples using the TEG. In a separate laboratory study, the levels of AT III were measured in control samples and compared with levels after 20% dilution, and 20% dilution with two units of AT III added to the diluent. Enhanced coagulation was demonstrated in saline-diluted samples (S) by shortening of r- and k-times, and increased alpha angle. In the SA samples, r-time shortening was prevented; k-time shortening and alpha-angle increase persisted, but to a reduced degree (difference from saline-only dilution P<0.051). There were no differences between samples C and CA. A predictable drop of AT III (24.2%) occurred with saline dilution, while AT III levels in the AT III/Saline group were similar to the undiluted control. Haemodilution-induced coagulation enhancement is attenuated, but not prevented, if AT III levels are maintained in the normal range. This is in keeping with the established concept of an antithrombin threshold preventing positive coagulation feedback into the intrinsic pathway."

These clinical benefits have shown to be more pronounced in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, it remains unknown whether cilostazol exerts different pharmacodynamic effects in patients with and without DM. This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over pharmacodynamic study comparing platelet function in patients with and without DM on aspirin and clopidogrel therapy. Patients (n=111) were randomly assigned to either cilostazol 100 mg or placebo twice daily for 14 days and afterwards crossed-over treatment for another 14 days. Platelet function was performed at baseline, 14 days post-randomisation, and 14 days post-cross-over. Functional testing to assess P2Y12 signalling included flow cytometric analysis of phosphorylation status of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein measured by P2Y12 reactivity index (PRI), light transmittance aggregometry and VerifyNow. Thrombin generation processes were also studied using thrombelastography. Significantly lower PRI values were observed following treatment with cilostazol compared with placebo both in DM and non-DM groups (p < 0.0001). The absolute between-treatment differences of PRI between groups was a 35.1% lower in patients with DM (p=0.039). Similar results were obtained using all other functional measures assessing P2Y12 signalling. Thrombin generation was not affected by cilostazol. Cilostazol reduces platelet reactivity both in patients with and without DM, although these pharmacodynamic effects are enhanced in patients with DM. Despite the marked platelet inhibition, cilostazol does not alter thrombin-mediated haemostatic processes, which may explain its ischaemic benefit without the increased risk of bleeding."

Glycerol was added to the red blood cells in the primary polyvinyl chloride plastic collection bag to achieve a concentration of 40 per cent W/V. The red blood cells were concentrated by centrifugation, and the supernatant glycerol was discarded. Each glycerolized unit was divided into four equal aliquots in the individual 600-ml bags of a dry quadruple polyvinyl chloride plastic system, and each aliquot was frozen and stored at -80 C. After thawing, sodium chloride solutions were used to wash the aliquots in the IBM Blood Processor 2991-1 or 2991-2 or the Haemonetics Blood Processor 115, and the washed aliquots were stored in a sodium chloride-glucose-phosphate solution at 4 C for 24 hours. Freeze-thaw recovery of the red blood cells was about 97 per cent, and freeze-thaw-wash recovery was about 84 per cent. Twenty-four-hour posttransfusion survival values were about 92 per cent for both nonrejuvenated and indated-rejuvenated red blood cells. Nonrejuvenated red blood cells, those frozen within three to five days of collection without biochemical modification, had normal oxygen transport function at the time of transfusion; rejuvenated red blood cells, those biochemically treated with PIGPA Solution A after three to five days of storage at 4 C, had improved oxygen transport function at the time of transfusion."

Sodium supply was proved to influence significantly the pressor response to angiotensin II and not that to noradrenaline thus implying the presence of arterial receptors which bind angiotensin specifically. Angiotensin caused an increase of the urinary excretion of electrolytes in hypertensive patients and a decreased electrolyte excretion in normotensives. In most hypertensive patients angiotensin was found to decrease the plasma angiotensinogen and to activate the bradykinin-bradykininogen and fibrinolytic systems. In the presence of urinary infection angiotensin increased the platelet adhesiveness and the thrombelastographic changes proved that in this condition angiotensin increases the tendency to thrombosis.

In people, use of this technology has been reported to improve management of hemostasis during surgery and decrease usage of blood products and is being used as a rapid screen for hypercoagulability. In veterinary medicine, clinical use of viscoelastic technology has been reported in dogs, cats, foals, and adult horses. This article will provide an overview of the technology, reagents and assays, applications in human and veterinary medicine, and limitations of the 3 viscoelastic POC analyzers in clinical use."

Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is accomplished by complex alterations of hemostasis, including acquired dysfunction of platelets, consumption coagulopathy and increased fibrinolysis. Despite major advances in blood conservation methods and perioperative care of the patients, transfusion rates in cardiac surgery remain high. Thromboelastography has an ability to assess almost all components of haemostatic system globally. Currently, thromboelastography is used with standard coagulation tests to decrease the microvascular bleeding and homologous blood transfusion in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. In this review, we aimed to discuss thromboelastography technology and its usage in cardiac surgery."

A controlled clinical trial with thromboelastographic risk stratification.,"The role of desmopressin acetate in attenuating blood loss and reducing homologous blood component therapy after cardiopulmonary bypass is unclear. The purpose of this investigation was to identify a subgroup of patients that may benefit from desmopressin acetate therapy. One hundred fifteen patients completed a prospective randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the effect of desmopressin acetate (0.3 microgram.kg-1) on mediastinal chest tube drainage after elective coronary artery bypass grafting surgery in patients with normal and abnormal platelet-fibrinogen function as diagnosed by the maximal amplitude (MA) on thromboelastographic (TEG) evaluation. The 115 patients evaluated were divided into two groups based on the MA of the post-cardiopulmonary bypass TEG tracing. Group 1 (TEG:MA greater than 50 mm) consisted of 86 patients, of whom 44 received desmopressin and 42 received placebo. Twenty-nine patients had abnormal platelet function (TEG:MA less than 50 mm) and were designated as group 2. In group 2, 13 received desmopressin and 16 placebo. During the first 24 h after cardiopulmonary bypass, the placebo-treated patients in group 2 had significantly greater mediastinal chest tube drainage when compared to placebo patients in group 1 (1,352.6 +/- 773.1 ml vs. 865.3 +/- 384.4 ml, P = 0.002). In addition to increases in blood loss, group 2 placebo patients also were administered an increased number of blood products (P less than 0.05). The desmopressin-treated patients in group 2 neither experienced increased mediastinal chest tube drainage nor received increased amounts of homologous blood products when compared to those in group 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

SIRS leads to costly complications and several strategies intended to ameliorate the symptoms that have been studied, including leukocyte reduction, using filtration. Although, the body of work suggests that leukoreduction attenuates SIRS, discrepancies remain within the literature.

CD010438,0,19690725,0,Water soluble SERS labels comprising a SAM with dual spacers for controlled bioconjugation.,"Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of Raman reporter molecules adsorbed to the surface of metal nanoparticles are labelling agents for the selective detection of biomolecules by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Advantages of SAM-based SERS labels include maximum coverage with Raman reporter molecules combined with their uniform molecular orientation within the SAM as well as minimal co-adsorption of other molecules from the surrounding. Water solubility and stability together with the option for controlled bioconjugation are desired properties of SERS labels. We present an approach to synthesize hydrophilic SERS labels in which the colloidal particle is stabilized by two different ethylene glycols attached to the SAM. This guarantees water solubility, independent of the type of a particular Raman reporter molecule and its properties at the SAM/solvent interface. Our dual SAM design is based on two different ethylene glycol spacers covalently bound to the same type of reporter molecule: a short monoethylene glycol (MEG-OH) and a longer triethylene glycol (TEG-COOH) moiety. The terminal carboxy group of the TEG spacer allows subsequent conjugation to biomolecules such as antibodies. Controlled bioconjugation is possible by varying the stoichiometric ratio of both spacers. Finally, dual SAM SERS labels are used in immuno-SERS microscopy for selective imaging of prostate-specific antigen in the epithelium of biopsies from patients with prostate cancer."
CD010438,0,22767493,0,Intracellular signaling controls endothelial cell prostacyclin secretion and regulation of blood clotting time.,"Blood is constantly in contact with a biological material, the blood vessel wall, without the need for anticoagulants to prevent clot formation on the vessel wall; however, man-made biomaterials require anticoagulants to prevent clot formation on the biomaterial. This study seeks to understand how some biomaterials elicit anticoagulant responses from endothelial cells (ECs), whereas others do not. Partial least squares regression analysis was used to correlate the activity of four relevant signaling molecules [extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Akt, and IκB kinase (IKK)] with human umbilical vein EC secretion of prostacyclin and clotting time of whole blood in contact with these cells. Prostacyclin secretion was increased when JNK activity (mean of all time-points) was elevated and IKK activity at 30 min was reduced. In addition, the clotting time, R-time measured by thromboelastography, was increased (reduced coagulability) when activity of both ERK and JNK (mean of all time-points) were increased and when Akt activity was increased at longer contact times (24-72 h after cell contact with material). Inhibition of each signaling molecule with subsequent testing for prostacyclin secretion and R-time confirmed the interrelationship between EC intracellular signaling and prostacyclin secretion. Generally, JNK inhibition decreased and IKK inhibition increased prostacyclin secretion. Inhibition of ERK or JNK generally increased coagulability, and Akt inhibition decreased the R-time of samples normally eliciting reduced coagulability. These findings increase our understanding of the signaling pathways involved in endothelial prostacyclin release and suggest targets for developing EC-seeded biomaterial surfaces that can minimize coagulation."
CD010438,0,2383328,0,[Original technic for preoperative hemodilution permitting deferred autologous transfusion (apropos of 106 cases)].,To carry out normovolemic haemodilution in the best security conditions we elaborate a new method of preoperative haemodilution. Collection of red cell concentrates and adequate compensation are made either in the blood bank or at the patient's bed side. There are two ways of proceeding: *manual plasmapheresis technic is used for the collection of less than 450 ml packed red cells; *collection of more than 450 ml packed red cells is carried out on a PCS Haemonetics cell separator. CPD autologous red cells concentrates prepared in that way can be stored to meet the patient's need during and after the operation. The patient is identified as donor and receiver as regards laboratory analysis and computer treatment as well. Information's transmission between blood bank hospital and clinics is secured with the same document. This method enables homologues transfusion save and completes autologous transfusion in 68% cases among 106 patients. It is to be noticed that none of the 98 haemodiluted patients suffered from thrombosis.

Fresh units of whole blood packs were mixed in the reservoir in a proportion of 5:1 with the anticoagulant solution. Having started the Cell Saver 5 in the automatic mode, the amount of Danaparoid in the retransfusion blood was determined (chromogenic Antifactor-Xa test). The lowest concentration of the anticoagulant was applied in 4 patients with Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia Type II undergoing total hip arthroplasty. There was a correlation between the concentration in the reservoir and in the retransfusion blood. None of the patients showed a disturbance of his coagulation system. One of them had slight clotting in the reservoir. We recommend the use of the lower concentrations tested: 4,5 U/ml or, particularly for patients with renal insufficiency or low body weight or expected high retransfusion volumes, 3 U/ml as anticoagulant concentrations. If the autotransfusion device is used according to the manufacturer's instructions there may be virtually no risk of clotting in the Cell Saver or of inhibition of the coagulation system in the patient."

A four-parameter chemorheological model was used to describe the time course of coagulation as measured by the Weissenberg Rheogoniometer. One parameter compares closely with the whole blood activated partial thromboplastin time, while the other three may be related to the chemical kinetics of clotting. The chemorheological model and experimental techniques were then tested in a dog preparation. It was found that rheological measurements are more self-consistent than either thrombelastography or the activated partial thromboplastin time for the assay of in vivo heparin in two dogs."
CD010438,0,19695750,0,Resuscitation and transfusion principles for traumatic hemorrhagic shock.,"The transfusion approach to massive hemorrhage has continually evolved since it began in the early 1900s. It started with fresh whole blood and currently consists of virtually exclusive use of component and crystalloid therapy. Recent US military experience has reinvigorated the debate on what the most optimal transfusion strategy is for patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock. In this review we discuss recently described mechanisms that contribute to traumatic coagulopathy, which include increased anti-coagulation factors and hyperfibrinolysis. We also describe the concept of damage control resuscitation (DCR), an early and aggressive prevention and treatment of hemorrhagic shock for patients with severe life-threatening traumatic injuries. The central tenants of DCR include hypotensive resuscitation, rapid surgical control, prevention and treatment of acidosis, hypothermia, and hypocalcemia, avoidance of hemodilution, and hemostatic resuscitation with transfusion of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets in a 1:1:1 unit ratio and the appropriate use of coagulation factors such as rFVIIa and fibrinogen-containing products (fibrinogen concentrates, cryoprecipitate). Fresh whole blood is also part of DCR in locations where it is available. Additional concepts to DCR since its original description that can be considered are the preferential use of ""fresh"" RBCs, and when available thromboelastography to direct blood product and hemostatic adjunct (anti-fibrinolytics and coagulation factor) administration. Lastly we discuss the importance of an established massive transfusion protocol to rapidly employ DCR and hemostatic resuscitation principles. While the majority of recent trauma transfusion papers are supportive of these general concepts, there is no Level 1 or 2 data available. Taken together, the preponderance of data suggests that these concepts may significantly decrease mortality in massively transfused trauma patients."

An experimental study with cw Nd: YAG and excimer lasers.,"A thermal (contact cw Nd:YAG) and non-thermal (Xe-Cl excimer) laser were used to irradiate fresh human blood in an experimental setting to investigate the possible thrombogenic properties of lasers and to compare the two laser modalities. Blood was obtained into 10 ml citrate test tubes from healthy volunteers. Laser irradiations were performed with cw Nd: YAG laser (10W, 3 and 6 secs) and with excimer laser (20 mJ, 60 ns pulses, 15 secs). Altogether, 80 samples were collected. A thromboelastographic (TEG) analysis was performed for each sample as well as the controls, which were taken simultaneously. Serum potassium levels indicating haemolysis were also determined. Thermal laser energy seems to have more thrombogenic effect than excimer laser. There appear to be no previous reports available in the literature using TEG to determine thrombogenicity of different lasers."
CD010438,0,2715990,0,The thromboelastogram and circulating lupus anticoagulant.,"Abnormal lupus anticoagulant (LA) levels, as measured with the activated partial tissue thromboplastin and tissue thromboplastin inhibition tests, are associated with a predisposition toward thromboembolic phenomena. Thromboelastogram (TEG) measurements have been proposed as a standardized assay to predict such a predisposition. We therefore correlated LA and TEG assessments in 46 women who were either apparently healthy controls or who had abnormal LA levels with such conditions as endometriosis and repeated pregnancy wastage. The coefficient of correlation (Rho) was .3282 (P = .025). Seven patients with an abnormal LA demonstrated a normal TEG, and eight with a normal LA exhibited an abnormal TEG. Only nine had concomitant LA and TEG abnormalities. We conclude that LA and TEG apparently are not interchangeable as predictors of a hypercoagulable state. While this study did not address which of the two assays has a better predictive value for thromboembolic phenomena, it suggested that each can identify a different patient population."

In addition to standard plasma based tests of coagulation, the thromboelastogram (TEG) has resurfaced as an ideal test in the trauma population to help guide the clinician in the administration of blood components in a goal directed fashion. We describe how thromboelastographic analysis is used to assist in the management of trauma patients with coagulopathies presenting to the emergency department, in surgery, and in the postoperative period. Indications for the utilization of the TEG and platelet mapping as point of care testing that can guide blood component therapy in a goal directed fashion in the trauma population are presented with emphasis on the more common reasons such as massive transfusion protocol, the management of traumatic brain injury with bleeding, the diagnosis and management of trauma in patients on platelet antagonists, the utilization of recombinant FVIIa, and the management of coagulopathy in terminal trauma patients in preparation for organ donation. The TEG allows for judicious and protocol assisted utilization of blood components in a setting that has recently gained acceptance. In our program, the inclusion of the perfusionist with expertise in performing and interpreting TEG analysis allows the multidisciplinary trauma team to more effectively manage blood products and resuscitation in this population."

In FIBTEM, cytochalasin D eliminates the contribution of platelets to whole blood clotting, but changing levels in fibrin(ogen) and erythrocytes may differently affect clot formation. Because dynamic changes of hematocrit are not reflected in plasma fibrinogen measurements, we hypothesized that the lack of erythrocytes in isolated plasma measurements would affect the relationship between the Clauss method and whole blood-based FIBTEM during cardiac surgery. Therefore, in the current study we investigated the influence of perioperative hematocrit changes on FIBTEM and fibrinogen measurements."

The prothrombin time and factor VII and X values were significantly accelerated after three months, but there was no further increase with continual administration for 18 months. After 12 to 18 months' treatment, however, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (Chandler's tube) was also significantly accelerated, which suggested a widening spectrum of effect. No overall acceleration of ""intrinsic"" clotting (partial thromboplastin time and thromboelastography) was found during the study, but the relatively small numbers may have been responsible. Further efforts are therefore required to find formulations and doses of oestrogens which, while relieving menopausal symptoms, cause less acceleration of blood clotting and platelet aggregation."

Patient demographics, coagulation parameters, CT characteristics, and outcome data of moderate and severe TBI patients without major extracranial injuries were prospectively collected. Coagulopathy was defined as absent, early but temporary, delayed, or early and sustained. Delayed/sustained coagulopathy was associated with a higher incidence of disturbed pupillary responses (40% versus 27%; p<0.001) and higher Traumatic Coma Data Bank (TCDB) CT classification (5 (2-5) versus 2 (1-5); p=0.003) than in patients without or with early, but short-lasting coagulopathy. The initial CT of patients with delayed/sustained coagulopathy more frequently showed intracranial hemorrhage and signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) compared to patients with early coagulopathy only. This was paralleled by higher in-hospital mortality rates (51% versus 33%; p<0.05), and poorer 6-month functional outcome in patients with delayed/sustained coagulopathy. The relative risk for in-hospital mortality was particularly related to disturbed pupillary responses (OR 8.19; 95% CI 3.15,21.32; p<0.001), early, short-lasting coagulopathy (OR 6.70; 95% CI 1.74,25.78; p=0.006), or delayed/sustained coagulopathy (OR 5.25; 95% CI 2.06,13.40; p=0.001). Delayed/sustained coagulopathy is more frequently associated with CT abnormalities and unfavorable outcome at 6 months after TBI than early, short-lasting coagulopathy. Our finding that not only the mere presence but also the time course of coagulopathy holds predictive value for patient outcome underlines the importance of systematic hemostatic monitoring over time in TBI."
CD010438,0,2177970,0,Usefulness of thrombelastography for dosage monitoring of low molecular weight heparin and unfractionated heparin during hemodialysis.,"Low molecular weight heparin (LMH) acts as an anticoagulation agent mainly through its anti-activated coagulation factor X (Xa) activity. Thrombelastography (TEG) is expected to be useful to monitor the dosage of LMH during hemodialysis because reaction time on TEG (TEG-r) is considered to reflect blood thromboplastin formation time, which depends on the formation of Xa. To test this possibility, we compared the usefulness of TEG, activated coagulation time (ACT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and anti-Xa activity in 28 hemodialysis patients using both conventional unfractionated heparin (UFH) and LMH on separate dialysis procedures. Anti-Xa activity of LMH was comparable to that of UFH when it was measured using both LMH and UFH as standards. Anti-Xa activity, which theoretically depended on the heparin concentration in blood samples, did not correlate with the degree of dialyzer clotting. The APTT correlated well with anti-Xa activity in patients using LMH (r = 0.686, p less than 0.01) and UFH (r = 0.906, p less than 0.01), but not with the degree of dialyzer clotting. The TEG-r correlated well with the degree of dialyzer clotting both in patients using LMH and those using UFH (measurements of samples obtained from the venous side of the extracorporeal circuit) and weakly correlated with anti-Xa activity in patients using LMH (r = 0.402, p less than 0.05). The ACT did not correlate with the degree of dialyzer clotting or anti-Xa activity. These results suggest that TEG-r reflects the efficacy of heparin in the extra-corporeal blood circuit, whereas APTT mainly reflects heparin concentration of the blood samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010438,0,10764688,0,Comparative in vitro efficacy of different platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists on platelet-mediated clot strength induced by tissue factor with use of thromboelastography: differentiation among glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists.,"In the present study, the in vitro efficacy of different platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) antagonists on platelet-fibrin-mediated clot strength under shear was compared with the antiaggregatory efficacy by using tissue factor (TF) thromboelastography (TEG). The ability of platelets to augment the elastic properties of blood clots under shear conditions was measured by computerized TEG under conditions of maximal platelet activation accelerated by recombinant TF. Under these conditions, platelets significantly enhance clot strength 8-fold (relative to platelet-free fibrin clots). This effect was inhibited to a different extent by various platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists; this inhibition appears to be dependent on the transmission of platelet contractile force to fibrin via the GPIIb/IIIa receptors. The GPIIb/IIIa antagonists with high binding affinity for resting and activated platelets and slow platelet dissociation rates (class I) but not those with fast platelet dissociation rates (class II) demonstrated potent and comparable inhibition of platelet aggregation and TF-TEG clot strength. Platelet GPIIb/IIIa antagonists of class I, such as XV459 (free-acid form of roxifiban), DMP802, XV454, and c7E3, demonstrated comparable inhibitory dose responses of TF-TEG clot strength and platelet aggregation, with an IC(50) of 50 to 70 nmol/L. In contrast, platelet GPIIb/IIIa antagonists from class II, with comparable antiaggregatory efficacy, such as DMP728, YZ202 (free-acid form of orbofiban), YZ211 (free-acid form of sibrafiban), YZ751, and other antagonists, have a much lower efficacy in altering the strength of TF-mediated clot formation (IC(50) >1.0 micromol/L). These data suggest differential efficacy among different GPIIb/IIIa antagonists in inhibiting platelet-fibrin clot retraction despite of equivalent antiaggregatory potency."

CD010438,0,21848180,0,A technique for autologous priming of the veno-venous bypass circuit during liver transplantation.,"Orthotopic liver transplantations (OLT) have been associated with significant blood loss and hemodilution, necessitating significant homologous blood component replacement. Increasing administration of homologous blood products has been found to be inversely related to patient and graft survival. Various methods to reduce the amount of blood products patients receive during OLT, such as antifibrinolytic therapy, thromboelastography-guided transfusion, phlebotomy, reduced central venous pressures intraoperatively, and the use of the veno-venous bypass (VVB) circuit, have been explored.The asanguineous priming volume of the VVB circuit increases the likelihood of the patient receiving homologous blood products due to hemodilution. It was reasoned that autologous priming of the VVB circuit in OLT surgery was a plausible adjunctive blood conservation technique given its application to the extracorporeal circuit during cardiac surgery. We describe our technique of modifying the VVB circuit for autologous priming. This technique adds minimal risk and a small amount of cost to the procedure, requires slightly more communication among members of the surgical team, and with proper sequencing, adds no additional length to the surgical procedure. It is recommended that this technique be considered for addition to the arsenal of blood conservation techniques when VVB is used during OLT."

CD010438,0,22356838,0,Hypothermic anticoagulation: testing individual responses to graded severe hypothermia with thromboelastography.,"Selective incircuit blood cooling could be an effective anticoagulation strategy during hemodialysis. However, it is currently unknown what blood temperature would ensure sufficient anticoagulation. Similarly, no information exists about potential interindividual variability in response to graded hypothermia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze effects of profound hypothermia on human coagulation. Furthermore, a mathematical relationship between blood temperatures and coagulation was sought to predict individual responses to blood cooling. It was designed as a laboratory study. Thromboelastography (TEG) measurements were taken at a temperature range of 38-12°C. To enable measurements below 20°C, the TEG device was placed into an air conditioned chamber allowing for setting of the temperatures over a wide range. The data were analyzed by regression analysis for pooled and individual measurements. Decreasing temperatures always led to a progressive reduction in blood coagulation by delaying the initiation of thrombus formation, as well as by decreasing the speed of its creation and growth. However, the response to cooling was not uniform and the interindividual variability exists. The relationship between blood temperature and coagulation is not linear but exponential (parameters R and K) and sigmoid (parameter α-angle). The lower the blood temperature, the more significant effect on blood coagulation decline. To predict an individual response of the coagulation system over a wide range of temperatures, a mathematical modeling can be used."

We tested the hypothesis that the parallel use of standard and abciximab-cytochalasin D-modified thromboelastography (TEG) can assess 7 days' postoperative hypercoagulability and can estimate the independent contribution of procoagulatory proteins and platelets. Thromboelastograms were performed before surgery, at the end of surgery, 6 h after surgery, and on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 7; they were analyzed for the reaction time and the maximal amplitude (MA). We calculated the elastic shear modulus of standard MA (G(t)) and modified MA (G(c)), which reflect total clot strength and procoagulatory protein component, respectively. The difference was an estimate of the platelet component (G(p)). There was a 10% perioperative increase of standard MA, corresponding to a 50% increase of G(t) (P < 0.0001) and an 86%-90% contribution of the calculated G(p) to G(t). We conclude that serial standard and modified thromboelastography may reveal prolonged postoperative hypercoagulability and the independent contribution of platelets and procoagulatory proteins to clot strength."

Former studies demonstrated that autotransfusion did not increase blood loss after cardiac surgery despite reduced plasma and platelets following centrifugation and washing of oxygenator content. The purpose of our study was to determine the content of heparin and unbound haemoglobin in autologous packed red cells. METHODS. 10 consenting patients undergoing cardiac surgery (table 1) were investigated. Immediately after termination of bypass blood samples were collected from the oxygenator and from autologous blood following concentration and washing with saline solution in the Haemonetics Cell-Saver 4. Contents of haemoglobin, haematocrit, heparin - with and without addition of antithrombine III - and unbound haemoglobin were analysed. RESULTS. Mean duration of extracorporeal circulation was 100.4 minutes. The oxygenators' volume averaged 2089.9 ml blood with a haemoglobin content of 6.7 g/dl and a haematocrit of 20.4%. This was reduced to 660.8 ml autologous blood with a haemoglobin content of 17.9 g/dl and a haematocrit of 57.2% (table 2). The heparin content of the oxygenator blood was 0.47 U/ml without AT III, and with AT III 0.87 U/ml. Autologous blood contained 0.009 U/ml without AT III; with AT III we measured 0.41 U/ml heparin. Unbound haemoglobin content amounted to 11.4 mg/dl in the oxygenator blood and 71.8 mg/dl in the autologous blood (table 3). CONCLUSIONS. Our results demonstrate that autologous blood following concentration and washing of the oxygenator blood with a Haemonetics Cell-Saver 4 contains heparin, but the amount of heparin is not enough to provoke bleeding after retransfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In this study, we sought to compare its antithrombogenicity to that of conventional polymers used in vascular bypass grafts so as to improve upon current patency rates, particularly in the microvascular setting. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), surface topography and composition were studied, respectively. The ability of the nanocomposite surface to repel both proteins and platelets in vitro was assessed using thromboelastography (TEG), fibrinogen ELISA assays, antifactor Xa assays, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and platelet adsorption tests. TEG analysis showed a significant decrease in clot strength (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001) and increase in clot lysis (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.0001) on the nanocomposite when compared to both poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) and PCU. ELISA assays indicate lower adsorption of fibrinogen to the nanocomposite compared to PTFE (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.01). Interestingly, increasing the concentration of POSS nanocages within these polymers was shown to proportionately inhibit factor X activity. Platelet adsorption at 120 min was also lower compared to PTFE and PCU (two-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). SEM images showed a ""speckled"" morphologic pattern with Cooper grades I platelet adsorption morphology on the nanocomposite compared to PTFE with grade IV morphology. On the basis of these results, we concluded that POSS nanocomposites possess greater thromboresistance than PTFE and PCU, making it an ideal material for the construction of both bypass grafts and microvessels."

The performance of single-stage extraction systems was firstly investigated by studying the effect of pH, TEG-COOH concentration and volume ratio on the partitioning of the different components of a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells supernatant. It was observed that lower pH values and high TEG-COOH concentrations favoured the selective extraction of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the PEG-rich phase. Higher recovery yields, purities and percentage of contaminants removal were always achieved in the presence of the ligand, TEG-COOH. The extraction of IgG could be enhanced using higher volume ratios, however with a significant decrease in both purity and percentage of contaminants removal. The best single-stage extraction conditions were achieved for an ATPS containing 1.3% (w/w) TEG-COOH with a volume ratio of 2.2, which allowed the recovery of 96% of IgG in the PEG-rich phase with a final IgG concentration of 0.21mg/mL, a protein purity of 87% and a total purity of 43%. In order to enhance simultaneously both recovery yield and purity, a four stage cross-current operation was simulated and the corresponding liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) data determined. A predicted optimised scheme of a counter-current multi-stage aqueous two-phase extraction was hence described. IgG can be purified in the PEG-rich top phase with a final recovery yield of 95%, a final concentration of 1.04mg/mL and a protein purity of 93%, if a PEG/dextran ATPS containing 1.3% (w/w) TEG-COOH, 5 stages and volume ratio of 0.4 are used. Moreover, according to the LLE data of all CHO cells supernatant components, it was possible to observe that most of the cells supernatant contaminants can be removed during this extraction step leading to a final total purity of about 85%."
CD010438,0,21942848,0,Thromboelastometric (ROTEM) findings in patients suffering from isolated severe traumatic brain injury.,"Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is often accompanied by coagulopathy and an increased risk of bleeding. To identify and successfully treat bleeding disorders associated with sTBI, rapid assessment of coagulation status is crucial. This retrospective study was designed to assess the potential role of whole-blood thromboelastometry (ROTEM(®), Tem International, Munich, Germany) in patients with isolated sTBI (abbreviated injury scale [AIS](head) ≥3 and AIS(extracranial) <3). Blood samples were obtained immediately following admission to the emergency room of the Trauma Centre Salzburg in Austria. ROTEM analysis (EXTEM, INTEM, and FIBTEM tests) and standard laboratory coagulation tests (prothrombin time index [PTI, percentage of normal prothrombin time], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], fibrinogen concentration, and platelet count) were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Out of 88 patients with sTBI enrolled in the study, 66 survived and 22 died. PTI, fibrinogen, and platelet count were significantly higher in survivors (p<0.005). Accordingly, aPTT was shorter in this group (p<0.0001). ROTEM analysis revealed shorter clotting times in extrinsically activated thromboelastometric test (EXTEM) and intrinsically activated thromboelastometric test (INTEM) (p<0.001), shorter clot formation times in EXTEM and INTEM (p<0.0001), and higher maximum clot firmness in EXTEM, INTEM, and FIBTEM (p<0.01) in survivors compared with non-survivors. Logistic regression analysis revealed extrinsically activated thromboelastometric test with cytochalasin D (FIBTEM) MCF and aPTT to have the best predictive value for mortality. According to the degree of coagulopathy, non-survivors received more RBC (p=0.016), fibrinogen concentrate (p=0.01), and prothrombin complex concentrate (p<0.001) within 24 h of arrival in the emergency room. ROTEM testing appeared to offer an early signal of severe life-threatening sTBI. Further studies are warranted to confirm these results and to investigate the role of ROTEM in guiding coagulation therapy."

This study challenged the hypothesis that recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) combined with fibrinogen concentrate may correct whole blood (WB) clot formation in ITP. Blood from ITP patients (n = 12) was drawn into tubes containing 3·2% citrate and corn trypsin inhibitor 18·3 μg/ml. WB [mean platelet count 22 × 10(9) /l (range 0-42)] was spiked in vitro with buffer, donor platelets (+40 × 10(9) /l), rFVIIa (1 or 4 μg/ml), fibrinogen (1 or 3 mg/ml), or combinations of rFVIIa and fibrinogen. Coagulation profiles were recorded by tissue factor (0·03 pmol/l) activated thromboelastometry. Coagulation in ITP was characterized by a prolonged clotting time (CT, 1490 s (mean)) and a low maximum velocity (MaxVel, 3·4 mm × 100/s) and maximum clot firmness (MCF, 38·2 mm). Fibrinogen showed no haemostatic effect, whereas rFVIIa reduced the CT and increased the MaxVel. The combination of fibrinogen and rFVIIa revealed a significant synergistic effect, improving all parameters (CT 794 s, MaxVel 7·9 mm × 100/s, MCF 50·7 mm) even at very low platelet counts. These data suggest that rFVIIa combined with fibrinogen corrects the coagulopathy of ITP even at very low platelet counts, and may represent an alternative to platelet transfusion."
CD010438,0,12818228,0,The management of perioperative bleeding.,"Excess perioperative bleeding remains a major complication following surgery, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. The principal causes of non-surgical haemostatic perioperative bleeding are a pre-existing undetected bleeding disorder, related to the nature of the operation itself or from coagulation abnormalities arising from massive blood loss. Very often, it is a combination and coexistence of various pathologies. Identifying patients at risk remains a major component of preventing excessive blood loss. Understanding the haemostatic changes occurring in the perioperative period, especially in complex procedures like cardiopulmonary bypass and orthotopic liver transplantation is crucial in developing new strategies for the management of perioperative bleeding. Pharmacological interventions, especially aprotinin, tranexamic acid, desmopressin and increasingly, recombinant VIIa are being used both in prophylaxis and therapeutically to stop bleeding. The use of near patient testing like thromboelastography and platelet function analyser has allowed for more detailed assessment of the various steps of haemostasis. One of the main goals is to reduce the usage of allogeneic blood transfusion and its attendant risks."
CD010438,0,3114572,0,Hemostatic evaluation of patients undergoing liver transplantation.,"A detailed coagulation and thromboelastographic study was done on the first 50 liver transplantation procedures performed at the Mayo Clinic between March 1985 and June 1986. Most of the patients suffered from primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or chronic active hepatitis. Seven patients required a second liver transplantation, and six patients died, none intraoperatively. Most of the patients had distorted hemostatic mechanisms preoperatively, as would be expected because the liver generates most of the clotting factors. The outstanding exception was factor VIII, which was usually in the high-normal range or even more elevated. Substantial deterioration of coagulation factors occurred regularly during reperfusion of the donor liver. In some instances, this trend was corrected within 1 hour, but platelet counts continued to decrease, and some coagulation factors rebounded only partially. Because thromboelastographic tracings are quickly available to the liver transplant team and because they tend to forewarn of impending hemostatic problems, we believe that thromboelastography is a reasonably effective procedure for monitoring coagulation during liver transplantation."

A recent report, however, documented lethal pulmonary thromboembolism in a patient following the administration of adipose-derived MSCs (ADSCs). In our study, we designed experiments to examine the role of tissue factor (TF), which is highly expressed at the level of mRNA and localized to the cell surface of cultured MSCs, as a triggering factor in the procoagulative cascade activated by infused MSCs. A high mortality rate of ~85% in mice was documented following intravenous infusion of mouse ADSCs within 24 h due to the observation of pulmonary embolism. Rotation thromboelastometry and plasma clotting assay demonstrated significant procoagulation by the cultured mouse ADSCs, and preconditioning of ADSCs with an anti-TF antibody or usage of factor VII deficient plasma in the assay successfully suppressed the procoagulant properties. These properties were also observed in human ADSCs, and could be suppressed by recombinant human thrombomodulin. In uncultured mouse adipose-derived cells (ADCs), the TF-triggered procoagulant activity was not observed and all mice infused with these uncultured ADCs survived after 24 h. This clearly demonstrated that the process of culturing cells plays a critical role in sensitizing these cells as a procoagulator through the induction of TF expression. Our results would recommend that clinical applications of MSCs to inhibit TF activity using anti-coagulant agents or genetic approaches to maximize clinical benefit to the patients."

Thus, TEG parameters of freshly drawn native blood were compared with those of recalcified citrated blood without celite in 10 healthy subjects, and the effect of repeated sampling over 240-min storage was evaluated. All TEG parameters following citrate storage remained stable between 30 min [clot formation time (k) = 7.2 +/- 0.6 min; maximum amplitude (ma) = 48.5 +/- 1.9 mm] and 2 h (k = 7.1 +/- 0.6 min; ma = 46.2 +/- 2.5 mm) after initial sampling, but were not comparable with native blood (k = 9.3 +/- 0.7 min; ma = 43.5 +/- 2.5 mm) at any time point. TEG parameters of repeatedly sampled citrated blood had a significant overall hypercoagulable trend throughout 4 h following sampling. In conclusion, in order to achieve reproducible results, citrated blood without celite may be utilized between 30 min and 2 h following sampling, but in normal subjects the TEG parameters following citrate storage are not comparable with native blood, possibly because of incomplete inhibition of the activation of the coagulation cascade. Thus, citrated blood can be used as a surrogate of native blood in assessing coagulation using TEG, but if repeated sampling is used the trend in hypercoagulability must be considered."

CD010438,0,1808765,0,Coagulation of flowing native blood: advantages over stagnant (tube) clotting tests.,"A broad-based, dynamic model of intrinsic coagulation is described. Non-anticoagulated whole blood was perfused through polyethylene tubing under standard conditions, and coagulation (cessation of flow) was monitored by pressure changes. The dynamic coagulation test (DCT) is a sequel to the shear-induced haemostasis, a platelet function test routinely performed prior to coagulation. DCT has two important advantages over stagnant overall clotting tests: i./DCT reflects platelet coagulant activities; selective activation by adenosine diphosphate or shear-stress or inhibition of platelets by prostacyclin greatly enhanced or prolonged dynamic coagulation, respectively. Furthermore, activation of platelets by plasminogen activators (streptokinase, t-PA) was manifested in a significantly shortened coagulation. ii./ DCT allows the rapid assessment of fibrin crosslinking, the mechanical stability of the clot formed. Antibody against factor XIIIa greatly prolonged the time until completion of clotting. In patients taking oral anticoagulant (n = 54), strong correlations were observed between DCT, the prothrombin time (INR) and the thrombelastograph measurements. It is concluded that this simple assay could be useful in the overall screening for coagulation abnormalities."

We compared OPA, using an ED 50 dose of adenosine diphosphate activation, with 2 whole blood assays, Plateletworks (PWA) and modified Thrombelastograph (TEG). Two sets of assays were performed on 43 surgery patients while on clopidogrel and off clopidogrel to determine the reversal of absolute and relative inhibition. The modified TEG had Spearman correlations with OPA for absolute (rho = .424; P = .006) and relative inhibition (rho = .742; P < .0001). PWA correlations with OPA gave absolute (rho = .28; P = .08) and relative inhibition (rho = .46; P = .004) values. Bland-Altman analysis indicated agreement of both tests with OPA, showing constant biases of about 18% and some dependency on mean magnitude error. Cohen effect size thresholds defined nonresponders as < 7.7% clopidogrel inhibition relative to baseline recovery of full platelet function. Apparent nonresponse to clopidogrel or lack of platelet recovery did not correlate with statin or NSAID therapies. These PWA and modified TEG whole blood assays could prove useful for monitoring the reversal of clopidogrel and NSAID inhibition before surgery. More important, these assays done at baseline and after beginning clopidogrel therapy could monitor the effectiveness for the individual patients with cardiovascular disease and help identify the need for alternative therapies."

CD010438,0,18070065,0,Evaluation of rFVIIa (NovoSeven) in Glanzmann patients with thromboelastogram.,"Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare platelet function disorder characterized by a defect in fibrinogen binding to platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa. Recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa) is a haemostatic agent approved for the treatment of haemophilia patients with inhibitors, patients with acquired haemophilia and in EU also for treatment of factor VII (FVII)-deficient patients and GT patients with antibodies to GPIIb-IIIa. The present study was conducted to evaluate the use of the whole blood test system, rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM), in measuring the overall haemostasis potential of rFVIIa in 28 GT patients treated with rFVIIa. The correlation of administered rFVIIa and time to start fibrin formation and clot dynamic/stability was assessed and correlation to the clinical response was elucidated. Assessments were performed on predose blood samples spiked with four different concentrations of rFVIIa and whole blood samples taken at 10 and 120 min following dosing. ROTEM parameters clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT) and maximum clot firmness (MCF) were measured. Both ex vivo and in vivo data showed beneficial effects on CT in the presence of rFVIIa, but no effect of added rFVIIa was seen on CFT and MCF. In conclusion, the use of thrombelastography at least in the modified form of ROTEM seems to be of limited use in predicting an adequate dose of rFVIIa in GT patients. A good clinical haemostatic response was recorded in spite of the limited changes in the ROTEM pattern supporting the conclusion that ROTEM should not be the method of choice for monitoring rFVIIa therapy in Glanzmann patients."

The synthetic antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid has emerged as an effective alternative in this respect for orthopedic and cardiac surgery. Although it seems less effective than aprotinin, it has not been associated with the increased risk of mortality of the latter. Thromboelastography to monitor the global hemostatic capacity and to guide the appropriate use of blood components in cardiac surgery is also effective in reducing the need for transfusion. Patients on antithrombotic drug therapy may need reversal before surgery to avoid excessive blood loss, or intraoperatively in cases of unexpected bleeding. Available options are protamine for unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, recombinant activated factor VII for fondaparinux, prothrombin complex concentrate for vitamin K antagonists and possibly for oral factor Xa inhibitors, dialysis and possibly activated prothrombin complex concentrate for oral thrombin inhibitors, desmopressin for aspirin and possibly for thienopyridines, and platelet transfusions for the latter."

CD010438,0,7576709,0,Surfactant incorporation markedly alters mechanical properties of a fibrin clot.,"Intra-alveolar clot formation is a common finding in acute and chronic inflammatory lung diseases. Incorporation of lipophilic surfactant components into a growing fibrin clot has recently been reported (Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 9:213-220). In the present study, we investigated the influence of such surfactant incorporation on the elastic properties and water permeability of the fibrin polymer. Thrombelastography and compaction experiments were employed for assessment of the elastic properties, and the permeability characteristics of the clot material were addressed in fibrin-packed columns. Two calf lung surfactant extracts (CLSE and Alveofact), Curosurf, and a synthetic phospholipid mixture (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, and palmitic acid at a ratio of 68.5:22.5:9 [wt/wt]) were used. The presence of surfactant did not affect the cleavage of fibrinopeptide A upon incubation of fibrinogen with thrombin (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique). Similarly, kinetics and extent of factor XIII-induced covalent crosslinkage of the fibrin network remained unchanged in the presence of surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and D-Dimer quantification upon subsequent clot lysis). All surfactants, however, dose-dependently decreased the elastic modulus of the arising fibrin polymer. The maximal amplitude in thrombelastography was reduced, and the recovery of fluid after centrifugation of the fibrin clot increased. Fibrin clots embedding natural surfactant material displayed reduced permeability for saline as compared with control fibrin polymers. Subsequent washout of lipids from these clots with Triton X-100 resulted in increased hydraulic conductivity. This was accompanied by an increase in pore size, suggesting altered architecture of the fibrin matrix generated in the presence of surfactant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010438,0,22304718,0,"Hyperbranched polyglycerols as trimodal imaging agents: design, biocompatibility, and tumor uptake.","Combining various imaging modalities often leads to complementary information and synergistic advantages. A trimodal long-circulating imaging agent tagged with radioactive, magnetic resonance, and fluorescence markers is able to combine the high sensitivity of SPECT with the high resolution of MRI over hours and days. The fluorescence marker helps to confirm the in vivo imaging information at the microscopic level, in the context of the tumor microenvironment. To make a trimodal long-circulating probe, high-molecular-weight hyperbranched polyglycerols (HPG) were modified with a suitable ligand for (111)In radiolabeling and Gd coordination, and additionally tagged with a fluorescent dye. The resulting radiopharmaceutical and contrast agent was nontoxic and hemocompatible. Measured radioactively, its total tumor uptake increased from 2.6% at 24 h to 7.3% at 72 h, which is twice the increase expected due to tumor growth in this time period. Both in vivo MRI and subsequent histological analyses of the same tumors confirmed maximum HPG accumulation at 3 days post injection. Furthermore, Gd-derivatized HPG has an excellent contrast enhancement on T1-weighted MRI at 10× lower molar concentrations than commercially available Galbumin. HPG derivatized with gadolinium, radioactivity, and fluorescence are thus long-circulating macromolecules with great potential for imaging of healthy and leaky blood vessels using overlapping multimodal approaches and for the passive targeting of tumors."

CD010438,0,594029,0,[Disturbances of the clotting mechanism in severe cerebro-cranial injuries (author's transl)].,"Factors II, V, X, VIII, thrombin time, platelet count and the thrombelastogram were estimated in 58 persons who had suffered cerebrocranial injuries of varying degree of severity. The aim of the investigation was to elucidate whether and to what extent the injury affected these parameters and whether the destruction of brain tissue could be regarded as the sole cause of the impairment of the clotting mechanism. First estimations in cases of cerebrocranial trauma uncomplicated by other injuries and in cases of cerebrocranial trauma complicated by moderately severe other injuries showed changes in factors II, V, X, VII as well as a pathological thrombelastogram, viz.: hypercoagulability. More pronounced changes were observed in cases where the cerebrocranial injuries were associated with severe complicating lesions: factors II, V, VII, X and the platelet count were reduced by 50-70 per cent of their normal values. Subsequent estimations carried out over a period of 15 days showed that the clotting mechanism had returned to nearly normal within 6-10 days. The use of heparin for normalizing disturbances of the clotting mechanism in cerebrocranial injuries is discussed."
CD010438,0,14872433,0,Understanding the hemostatic effects of recombinant factor VIIa by clot wave form analysis.,"The monitoring of coagulation-inhibitor bypassing agents, including recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa), remains a major issue in the management of clinical hemophilia. Clotting assays using prothrombin time (PT) and measurements of factor VII (FVII) activity do not always reflect the hemostatic effects of treatment. Thrombelastography can be used to observe the global effects of treatment on the overall coagulation process and is especially useful for observing the effects of hemostatic treatment in hemophilia patients with inhibitors. Waveform analysis is another technique for evaluating global hemostatic condition where changes in light transmission during routine clotting assays, such as the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), are measured. We found that waveforms differed between individual patients with severe hemophilia A (FVIII:C < 1.0 IU/dL) with levels of sensitivity at below FVIII:C 1.0 IU/dL. Clot waveforms indicated dose-dependent improvements in clot formation after the addition of rFVIIa to both FVIII-deficient and factor IX (FIX)-deficient plasma. The improvements were further enhanced in the presence of both platelets and synthetic phospholipids, and were more pronounced with FVIII-deficient plasma than with FIX-deficient plasma. It appears that clot waveform analysis provides a very useful means for monitoring hemostasis in hemophilia A patients with inhibitors."
CD010438,0,23075633,0,Haemostatic monitoring during postpartum haemorrhage and implications for management.,"Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a major risk factor for maternal morbidity and mortality. PPH has numerous causative factors, which makes its occurrence and severity difficult to predict. Underlying haemostatic imbalances such as consumptive and dilutional coagulopathies may develop during PPH, and can exacerbate bleeding and lead to progression to severe PPH. Monitoring coagulation status in patients with PPH may be crucial for effective haemostatic management, goal-directed therapy, and improved outcomes. However, current PPH management guidelines do not account for the altered baseline coagulation status observed in pregnant patients, and the appropriate transfusion triggers to use in PPH are unknown, due to a lack of high-quality studies specific to this area. In this review, we consider the evidence for the use of standard laboratory-based coagulation tests and point-of-care viscoelastic coagulation monitoring in PPH. Many laboratory-based tests are unsuitable for emergency use due to their long turnaround times, so have limited value for the management of PPH. Emerging evidence suggests that viscoelastic monitoring, using thrombelastography- or thromboelastometry-based tests, may be useful for rapid assessment and for guiding haemostatic therapy during PPH. However, further studies are needed to define the ranges of reference values that should be considered 'normal' in this setting. Improving awareness of the correct application and interpretation of viscoelastic coagulation monitoring techniques may be critical in realizing their emergency diagnostic potential."

CD010438,0,11734662,0,Disintegration and reorganization of fibrin networks during tissue-type plasminogen activator-induced clot lysis.,"In this study, we investigated tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced lysis of glutamic acid (glu)-plasminogen-containing or lysine (lys)-plasminogen-containing thrombin-induced fibrin clots. We measured clot development and plasmin-mediated clot disintegration by thromboelastography, and used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to document the structural changes taking place during clot formation and lysis. These events occurred in three overlapping stages, which were initiated by the addition of thrombin, resulting first in fibrin polymerization and clot network organization (Stage I). Autolytic plasmin cleavage of glu-plasminogen at lys-77 generates lys-plasminogen, exposing lysine binding sites in its kringle domains. The presence of lys-plasminogen within the thrombin-induced fibrin clot enhanced network reorganization to form thicker fibers as well as globular complexes containing fibrin and lys-plasminogen having a greater level of turbidity and a higher elastic modulus (G) than occurred with thrombin alone. Lys-plasminogen or glu-plasminogen that had been incorporated into the fibrin clot was activated to plasmin by tPA admixed with the thrombin, and led directly to clot disintegration (Stage II) concomitant with fibrin network reorganization. The onset of Stage III (clot dissolution) was signaled by a sustained secondary rise in turbidity that was due to the combined effects of lys-plasminogen presence or its conversion from glu-plasminogen, plus clot network reorganization. SEM images documented dynamic structural changes in the lysing fibrin network and showed that the secondary turbidity rise was due to extensive reorganization of severed fibrils and fibers to form wide, occasionally branched fibers. These degraded structures contributed little, if anything, to the structural integrity of the residual clot, and eventually collapsed completely during the course of progressive clot dissolution. These results provide new perspectives on the major structural events that occur in the fibrin clot matrix during fibrinolysis."

CD010438,0,22017416,0,Management of major trauma haemorrhage: treatment priorities and controversies.,"The severely injured trauma patient often arrives in the emergency department bleeding, coagulopathic and in need of a blood transfusion. The diagnosis and management of these patients has vastly improved with a better understanding of acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). In the emergency setting, traditional laboratory coagulation screens are of limited use in the diagnosis and management of life-threatening bleeding. Whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) provide a rapid evaluation of clot formation, strength and lysis. Rapid diagnosis of ATC and aggressive haemostatic transfusion strategies utilizing early high doses of plasma are associated with improved outcomes in trauma. At present there is no accurate guide for transfusion in trauma, therefore blood and clotting products are administered on an empiric basis. Targeted transfusion therapy for major trauma haemorrhage based on comprehensive and rapid measures of coagulation e.g. TEG/ROTEM may lead to improved outcomes while optimizing blood utilization. Evidence for the clinical application of TEG and ROTEM in trauma is emerging with a number of studies evaluating their ability to diagnose coagulopathy early and facilitate goal-directed transfusion.

Preoperatively, fibrinolysis defined as a whole blood clot lysis index of less than 80% was present in 29 patients (29.9%), and a euglobulin lysis time of less than 1 h was present in 13 patients. Fibrinolysis increased progressively during surgery in 80 patients (82.5%) and was most severe on reperfusion of the graft liver in 33 patients (34%). When whole blood clot lysis (F less than 180 min) was observed during reperfusion of the graft liver, blood coagulability was tested by thrombelastography using both a blood sample treated in vitro with epsilon-aminocaproic acid (0.09%) and an untreated sample. Blood treated with epsilon-aminocaproic acid showed improved coagulation without fibrinolytic activity in all 74 tests. When whole blood clot lysis time was less than 120 min, generalized oozing occurred, and the effectiveness of epsilon-aminocaproic acid was demonstrated in vitro during the pre-anhepatic and post-anhepatic stages, epsilon-aminocaproic acid (1 g, single intravenous dose) was administered.

All women achieved haemostasis and had uncomplicated regional block, delivery and surgical procedures. The point of care device--rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) was used to monitor the patients' coagulation and determine the dose of rFVIIa to achieve in vitro haemostasis in these women that was then subsequently used in vivo. Low-dose rFVIIa seems to be effective and safe in the management of delivery and enables provision of regional blocks in women with severe FXI deficiency."
CD010438,0,21453422,0,Evaluation of the overall haemostatic effect of recombinant factor VIIa by measuring thrombin generation and stability of fibrin clots.,"It has been reported that thrombin generation test (TGT) may be a useful tool to monitor recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa). However, TGT does not reflect the stability of fibrin clot and its resistance to fibrinolysis which are crucial. Using whole-blood thromboelastography (TEG) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), we developed an in-vitro model to assess fibrin clot stability. Fibrin fibres were thicker in haemophiliacs compared with controls (P < 0.0001). After addition of rFVIIa 90 μg kg(-1), the diameter of fibrin fibres was dramatically decreased (P = 0.006). TEG-tPA assay showed a dose-dependent improvement of clot stability in the presence of rFVIIa. These data demonstrate a significant correlation between fibrin clot structure and its stability (P = 0.001). We also showed a correlation between thrombin generating capacity and clot resistance to fibrinolysis. Despite this overall correlation, a relatively large spreading around a general trend was observed, suggesting that the two assays bring complementary information on the haemostatic effect of rFVIIa."
CD010438,0,9539584,0,Endogenous heparin-like substances significantly impair coagulation in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation.,"Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is associated with severe bleeding, especially after reperfusion of the grafted liver. Heparin released from the liver graft contributes to postreperfusion coagulopathy. Although patients with liver cirrhosis have increased levels of endogenous heparinoids, the role of these substances during liver transplantation is unclear. Therefore, we performed native and heparinase-modified thrombelastography (TEG) in 72 patients undergoing OLT. TEG was performed at skin incision, 10 min before and 10 min after clamping of the vena cava, 10 min before and 10 min after graft perfusion, and at the end of surgery. Heparinase-modified TEG compared with native TEG demonstrated heparin activity. In contrast to other investigations, we found significant heparin effects before reperfusion, although patients received no exogenous heparin. These heparin effects were greater in patients with cirrhosis compared with patients with cancer as the underlying disease leading to OLT. Administration of coagulation factors is the usual treatment of coagulopathies during OLT. The comparison of native versus heparinase-modified TEG can distinguish between heparin activity or coagulation factor deficiency as a cause of bleeding complications and provides a rational approach to the treatment of bleeding during OLT."

CD010438,0,10148073,0,Heparin washout in the pediatric Cell Saver bowl.,"The possibility of residual heparin in washed red cells transfused to neonatal or pediatric cardiac patients following bypass prompted a measurement of heparin concentrations. Samples were taken during 10 adult and 10 neonatal and pediatric bypass cases. Sample A was from the bypass circuit, Sample B from the Haemonetics Cell Saver bowl inlet before washing, Sample C from the Cell Saver bowl outlet after washing, and Sample D from the patient ten minutes after protamine. Heparin concentrations were measured by a chromogenic assay using activated Factor X. There was no significant difference between the adult and pediatric groups in the levels of heparin concentration on bypass, pre-washing and post-washing, and in the patients following protamine. In the pediatric group, only .002% of the pre-washed heparin remained after washing. This extremely low level of heparin (.0027 units/ml) is only 0.34 units in a 125 ml pediatric unit of Cell Saver blood. Based on post bypass patient samples, this has no clinical significance. Therefore, the Cell Saver can be used safely with neonates and pediatric patients without concern regarding residual heparin when properly processed."

CD010438,0,21389323,0,Aptamer ARC19499 mediates a procoagulant hemostatic effect by inhibiting tissue factor pathway inhibitor.,"Hemophilia A and B are caused by deficiencies in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX, respectively, resulting in deficient blood coagulation via the intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic coagulation pathway, mediated by factor VIIa and tissue factor (TF), remains intact but is negatively regulated by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), which inhibits both factor VIIa and its product, factor Xa. This inhibition limits clot initiation via the extrinsic pathway, whereas factor deficiency in hemophilia limits clot propagation via the intrinsic pathway. ARC19499 is an aptamer that inhibits TFPI, thereby enabling clot initiation and propagation via the extrinsic pathway. The core aptamer binds tightly and specifically to TFPI. ARC19499 blocks TFPI inhibition of both factor Xa and the TF/factor VIIa complex. ARC19499 corrects thrombin generation in hemophilia A and B plasma and restores clotting in FVIII-neutralized whole blood. In the present study, using a monkey model of hemophilia, FVIII neutralization resulted in prolonged clotting times as measured by thromboelastography and prolonged saphenous-vein bleeding times, which are consistent with FVIII deficiency. ARC19499 restored thromboelastography clotting times to baseline levels and corrected bleeding times. These results demonstrate that ARC19499 inhibition of TFPI may be an effective alternative to current treatments of bleeding associated with hemophilia."

CD010438,0,18393980,0,Enhancement of factor VIIa haemostatic efficacy by formulation with PEGylated liposomes.,"Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is an effective treatment of the haemophilia patient with inhibitors and acquired haemophilia. However, on account of its relatively short half-life (HL), achieving therapeutic efficacy with FVIIa requires repeated injections. The development of a long-acting FVIIa product would therefore be beneficial. The formulation of factor VIII with PEGylated liposomes (PEGLip) was previously shown to extend the bleeding-free period in haemophilia patients. We report here an enhancement of haemostatic efficacy by similarly formulating FVIIa with PEGLip. Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that FVIIa binds non-covalently but with high affinity and specificity to PEGLip. A one-stage clotting assay demonstrated that formulation of FVIIa with PEGLip does not affect FVIIa activity and stability. A pharmacokinetic study in rats demonstrated that PEGLip formulation of FVIIa extends circulation time and results in higher FVIIa levels several hours after injection. Thromboelastography experiments indicated that PEGLip-FVIIa induces faster clot formation and higher clot stability than standard formulated FVIIa. These results suggest that formulation of FVIIa with PEGLip may lead to a safe and effective long-acting FVIIa that improves the care of haemophilic patients with inhibitors and acquired haemophilia."

These materials were designed as monodisperse analogues of poly(ethylene glycol) for use in biomedical applications where reproducible behavior is important. Synthesis of the monomer was evaluated using two routes. For small-scale preparations, tetraethylene glycol (TEG) was monoprotected with dihydropyran, converted to an alkoxide, and alkylated with ethyl bromoacetate. On larger scales, TEG was alkylated directly by treatment with sodium, followed by ethyl bromoacetate. The amine function was introduced by mesylation followed by treatment with sodium azide. Reduction of the azide to amino groups was performed over Pd/C using either hydrogen or formic acid as proton sources. Assembly of the oligomers was accomplished using standard DCC/NHS chemistry and an iterative dimerization sequence after appropriate deprotection of a pair of monomers. The amino group was protected by retaining the azido group as a latent amine. A series of ATTAn oligomers was prepared (n = 1-8). A lipid conjugate of the octamer, ATTA8-DSPE, was synthesized."

The PEG dehydrogenase linked with 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol was found in the particulate fraction of sonic extracts and catalyzed the formation of a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine-positive compound, possibly an an aldehyde. The enzyme has a wide substrate specificity towards PEGs: from diethylene glycol to PEG 20,000 Km values for tetraethylene glycol (TEG), PEG 400, and PEG 6,000 were 11, 1.7, and 15 mM, respectively. The metabolic products formed from TEG by intact cells were isolated and identified by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as triethylene glycol and TEG-monocarboxylic acid plus small amounts of TEG-dicarboxylic acid, diethylene glycol, and ethylene glycol. From these enzymatic and analytical data, the following metabolic pathway was proposed for PEG: HO(CH2CH2O)nCH2CH2OH leads to HO(CH2CH2O)nCH2CHO leads to HO(CH2CH2O)nCH2COOH leads to HO(CH2CH2O)n-1CH2CH2OH."

CD010438,0,12680493,0,Quality of red blood cells using autotransfusion devices: a comparative analysis.,"Cell salvage devices are routinely used to process and wash red blood cells (RBCs) shed during surgical interventions. Although the principle theory of cell saving is the same, the actual process to achieve this is very different from one device to another. The purpose of this study was to compare the quality of washed, concentrated RBC produced by five very different cell-saving devices, specifically the Cobe BRAT 2, Medtronic Sequestra 1000, Haemonetics Cell Saver 5, Medtronic Autolog, and the Fresenius CATS. Reservoir and washed red blood cells were analyzed for hematocrit (Hct), platelets (PLT), leukocytes (WBC), potassium (K+), heparin, plasma-free hemoglobin (PFH), RBC mass recovery and recovery rate. The Haemonetics and BRAT 2 had the highest RBC recovery. All devices adequately removed heparin and potassium. The Medtronic Autolog had the highest removal of platelets and PFH; whereas, the BRAT had the lowest. Although the Autolog had the highest leukocyte removal, leukocytes were not adequately washed out by any of the autotransfusion devices.

CD010438,0,12680495,0,Use of aprotinin during cardiopulmonary bypass in a patient with protein C deficiency.,"This case study reviews cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) management in a Protein C deficient patient undergoing reoperation for an atrioventricular (AV) valve replacement with the use of aprotinin. Protein C inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the coagulation cascade and inactivates tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor, thus maintaining hemostasis. Protein C deficiency can cause hypercoagulability and may result in thrombotic episodes, especially in areas of low blood flow or during activation of the coagulation cascade. A 17-year-old male presented with a functional single ventricle and AV valve regurgitation. The patient had a history of three previous AV valve replacements. Protein C deficiency was first diagnosed after thrombosis of the first valve prosthesis. Other case studies in protein C deficient patients suggested the use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) before bypass to restore protein C levels, ATIII replacement before heparin administration, and avoidance of aprotinin because of its known competitive inhibition of activated protein C. Two units of FFP were given by anesthesia before the administration of aprotinin, and two units of FFP were added to the pump prime. The full Hammersmith loading dose of aprotinin was administered just before initiation of CPB. The same dose of aprotinin was added to the pump prime just before initiation of CPB. Additional heparin (100 U/kg) was administered every hour during bypass. Activated clotting time tests (ACTs) were performed every 15 min, and thromboelastographs (TEGs) were performed every hour. The patient recovered from surgery without major complications, and there were no perioperative thrombotic events. The patient was discharged on day 41 and is doing well. Postoperative atrial arrhythmias were a contributing factor to his delayed discharge. The use of aprotinin in a protein C deficient patient undergoing open-heart surgery may be safe if protein C levels are restored before administration of aprotinin, and anticoagulation is carefully monitored."

When molecular weights are limited to < 5 kDa, such materials are directly injectable using a needle size no larger than 22 gauge. Somewhat hydrophilic polymers can be produced by using the diketene acetal 3,9-diethylidene-2,4,8,10-tetraoxaspiro[5.5]undecane and triethylene glycol (TEG), while hydrophobic materials can be produced by using the diketene acetal and 1,10-decanediol. Molecular weight can be reproducibly controlled by using an excess of the diol, or by use of an alcohol that acts as a chain-stopper. Erosion rates can be controlled by varying the amount of latent acid incorporated into the polymer backbone. Toxicology studies using the TEG polymer have been completed and have shown that the polymer is non-toxic. Toxicology studies using the decanediol polymer are underway.

Aspirin resistance was assessed by thrombelastography in 45 people with ischaemic stroke and 25 controls. Plasma interleukin (IL)-6 was measured. Stroke severity was assessed using the modified Rankin scale and National Institute of Health Stroke Score within 72 h of stroke. Aspirin resistance was more common in the stroke than the control group (67% versus 40%, P=0.028), and within the stroke group the aspirin-resistant group had a higher Rankin score (4.0 versus 2.0, P=0.013). Aspirin resistance was greater in lacunar than embolic strokes (platelet activation 79% versus 59%, P=0.020). The stroke aspirin-resistant group had higher levels of IL-6 than the stroke aspirin-sensitive group (2.4+/-1 versus 1.8+/-0.9 ng/mL, P=0.037). Using multivariate analysis, we examined the interrelationships between aspirin resistance, IL-6, and stroke severity. These analyses showed that IL-6 was independently associated with stroke severity as the outcome (B=3.738, P=0.036), and aspirin resistance was independently associated with IL-6 (B=0.765, P=0.005) as the outcome. In conclusion, aspirin resistance is related to stroke severity and aspirin resistance is more common in lacunar strokes than embolic strokes."

CD010438,0,9702004,0,Effects of wine on plasma fibrinolytic and coagulation systems.,"The in-vitro effects of citrus, red and white wines on human plasma fibrinolytic enzymes were compared. When citrus wine was added to plasmin, H-D-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA (S-2251) amidolysis was not changed. Although, it was significantly inhibited when red and white wines were added. The pyro-Glu-Gly-Arg-pNA (S-2444) amidolysis of the plasminogen activator urokinase was inhibited by all types of wine. Since the same amount of Et-OH as the wine's content did not effect on these inhibitions, it can be assumed to be due to other unknown substances in wines besides alcohol. In in-vivo test of 20 normal volunteers (ages 20-52) with various wines equivalent to 30-60 ml of alcohol content, the coagulation parameters of gamma and kappa values on thromboelastography were not so much changed after 1-2 hrs of the application. Also, there was not much difference of the fibrinolytic parameters in terms of the plasma euglobulin clotlysis time, S-2444 amidolysis, and Ma values on thromboelastography. However, the protein concentration and the enzyme activity of the urokinase-like plasminogen activator, which were extracted from the plasma of volunteers who had the citrus wine 1 hr before the test were higher than twice of the before control. The main molecular form of this enzyme was proved to have a molecular weight of about 30,000 by zymography. It is concluded that not only wines induce the endogenous plasminogen activator just like other alcoholic beverages but also wines contain a fibrinolysis inhibitor which works directly to the enzyme dissolubility. This finding warns that extremely complex results can be expected depending on the test method."

In this study, changes in the expression of neutrophil adhesion molecules (CD11b/CD18, CD50/54, CD62L) and platelet-neutrophil complex (PNC) formation were investigated by a flow cytometric method in healthy donors following a double dose plateletpheresis (DDP) procedure. Our results show that DDP which are carried out by the Fresenius AS.TEC 204 and Haemonetics MCS+ cause a significant increase in PNC formation in donors. Additionally, the Fresenius AS.TEC 204 device caused a decrease in CD62L expression which is a sign of mild neutrophil activation. Although the clinical significance of these laboratory changes is not clear, the occurrence of neutrophil activation and increased PNC formation might predispose certain donors to thrombotic complications following DDP."

Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is a non-plasma-derived, rapid-acting, and rapidly infused potential treatment. This randomized, single-center, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, dose-escalation, exploratory phase 1 trial assessed safety and effects of rFVIIa in reversing warfarin-induced changes in bleeding and coagulation parameters, using a punch biopsy-induced bleeding model in healthy subjects. The effects of warfarin (experiment 1) and rFVIIa (5-80 microg/kg; experiment 2) were evaluated. Outcomes were bleeding duration, blood loss, coagulation parameters, and safety. Warfarin treatment significantly increased bleeding duration and blood loss from pretreatment (experiment 1, 12 subjects). However, these parameters after rFVIIa treatment were not significantly different from placebo (experiment 2, 85 subjects). Mean activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio were reduced from warfarin-elevated levels. rFVIIa (80 microg/kg) significantly reversed warfarin effects on all thromboelastography parameters, compared with placebo (P < .05), and returned the thrombin generation speed to baseline. There were no thromboembolic or serious adverse events. In this exploratory trial, the reversal of warfarin effects was observed in the thromboelastography, thrombin generation, and clotting assays. However, this reversal did not translate to improvements in the bleeding model parameters evaluated in the punch biopsy model. Trial registration is exempt (phase 1)."
CD010438,0,15502028,0,Fibrinogen in children undergoing cardiac surgery: is it effective?,"There is speculation based on laboratory tests and biochemical data regarding the functional integrity of the fibrinogen in young children. Recent investigations in adults have demonstrated that their fibrinogen level correlates with the thromboelastogram maximum amplitude (MA) after modification with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blocker that uncouples platelet-fibrinogen interactions. We postulate that if the fibrinogen of young children is functionally intact then their fibrinogen levels should also correlate with modified thromboelastogram MA values as they do in adults. We compared modified and unmodified thromboelastogram variables of 250 children <2 yr old undergoing cardiac surgery with their fibrinogen levels and platelet counts. Five age groups were distinguished to determine if and when correlations become significant (<1 mo, 1-3 mo, 3-6 mo, 6-12 mo, and 12-24 mo). Fibrinogen levels correlated with modified thromboelastogram MAs only in the 12-24 mo group. In this 12-24 mo age group other correlations between fibrinogen levels and thromboelastogram variables influenced by fibrinogen also became significant, as did correlations noted in adults between platelet counts and thromboelastogram variables.

CD010438,0,18500941,0,Complete correction of hemophilia A with adeno-associated viral vectors containing a full-size expression cassette.,"Hemophilia A is caused by a deficiency in the factor VIII (FVIII) gene. Constrained by limited packaging capacity, even the 4.3-kb B domain-deleted FVIII remained a challenge for delivery by a single adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector. Studies have shown that up to a 6.6-kb vector sequence may be packaged into AAV virions, which suggested an alternative strategy for hemophilia A gene therapy. To explore the usefulness of AAV vectors carrying an oversized FVIII gene, we constructed the AAV-FVIII vector under the control of a beta-actin promoter with a cytomegalovirus enhancer (CB) and a bovine growth hormone (bGH) poly(A) sequence. The CB promoter plus bGH signal was shown to be 3- to 5-fold more potent than the mini-transthyretin (TTR) promoter with a synthetic poly(A) sequence for directing FVIII expression in the liver. Despite the 5.75-kb genome size of pAAV-CB-FVIII, sufficient AAV vectors were produced for in vivo testing. Approximately 3- to 5-fold more FVIII secretion was observed in animals receiving AAV-CB-FVIII vectors than in those receiving standard-sized AAV-TTR-FVIII vectors. Both the activated partial thromboplastin time assay and the whole blood thromboelastographic analysis confirmed that AAV-FVIII vectors fully corrected the bleeding phenotype of hemophilia mice. These results suggest that AAV vectors with an oversized genome should be useful for not only hemophilia A gene therapy but also other diseases with large cDNA such as muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis."
CD010438,0,3717700,0,Nonionic contrast medium: effects on blood coagulation and complement activation in vitro.,"A nonionic contrast medium was evaluated in vitro for its effects on coagulation and complement activation in comparison to a low osmolal contrast agent. In clotting assays each contrast medium was mixed with blood and clotting parameters were analyzed by using a thromboelastographic machine. Platelet function was studied by incubating platelet-rich plasma with individual contrast medium, and the subsequent challenge of a platelet aggregating agent. Complement activation was assessed by the hydrolysis of C3 protein into C3c fragment in contrast medium-incubated serum. Immunoelectrophoresis was used to detect C3c protein. Both the nonionic contrast medium and the low osmolal contrast agent acted as anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents, however, results with the low osmolal contrast agent were more pronounced compared to the nonionic contrast medium. Even at nonphysiologic concentration of contrast medium, no significant conversion at C3 to C3c was seen. Since these two agents caused hypocoagulable states in vitro, it is likely that patients with thrombocytopenia, severe liver disease and with clotting factor deficiencies may present hemostatic complications during angiographic procedures."
CD010438,0,2499962,0,Systemic effects of tissue plasminogen activator-associated fibrinolysis and its relation to thrombin generation in orthotopic liver transplantation.,"Orthotopic liver transplantation is frequently associated with hyperfibrinolysis, the origin and clinical relevance of which is largely unknown. In 20 orthotopic liver transplantations, we studied the occurrence and systemic effects of hyperfibrinolysis. Severe fibrinolysis was defined to be present when the euglobulin-clot lysis time and the whole-blood-clot lysis time, as measured by thrombelastography, were shorter than 60 and 90 min, respectively, at some time during the operation. Based on these criteria, 7 patients had minimal fibrinolysis (group I), and 13 patients had severe fibrinolysis (group II). In group II a gradual increase of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity was seen during the anhepatic stage, followed by an ""explosive"" increase immediately after graft reperfusion (P = 0.0004, compared with group I), and a reduction of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity. Plasma degradation products of fibrinogen and fibrin increased parallel to t-PA activity, and levels were significantly higher at 45 min after graft reperfusion in group II compared with group I (P less than 0.04). Thrombin-antithrombin III complexes showed an identical steady increase in both groups, indicating that increased t-PA activity was not related to thrombin formation. A combination of increased endothelial release and reduced hepatic clearance may have caused the increased t-PA activity. The t-PA-associated destruction of fibrinogen and fibrin after graft reperfusion is consistent with the clinical signs of severe oozing often seen in this period. These observations may have important clinical implications for the treatment of bleeding in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation."
CD010438,0,19696040,0,Exercise-induced hemostatic alterations are detectable by rotation thrombelastography (ROTEM): A marathon study.,"Rotation thrombelastography (ROTEM) provides a whole blood assay that allows the assessment of plasmic- and platelet-related hemostasis in a single-step procedure. In our current study, we focused on the capability of the method to detect hemostatic alterations induced by physical exercise, enrolling 33 healthy participants of the Dusseldorf Marathon 2006. Venous blood drawn immediately before and after finishing the marathon was analyzed by a rotational thrombelastograph (Pentapharm, Munich, Germany). On initiation of blood coagulation by recalcification, standard ROTEM parameters were determined. Comparison of the results obtained before and after the physical exercise was performed using the Student t test for paired samples. As a result, the mean clotting time (CT) determined from blood samples obtained immediately after the marathon was significantly shorter (662.9 + or - 67.8 seconds vs 505.6 + or - 97.3 seconds, P = .002) and the mean maximal clot firmness was significantly broader (48.4 +/- 6.6 mm vs 51.5 +/- 4.5 mm, P = .0004) when compared to results obtained before the physical exercise. Differences between mean clot formation times (CFTs; 280.6 + 96 seconds vs 270.4 + or - 73.8 seconds) and mean alpha angles (45.9 degrees + or - 8 degrees vs 47.8 degrees + or - 5.8 degrees ) before and after the marathon were not statistically significant. Remarkably, some participants showed opposed results, particularly prolongation of CT and narrowing of maximum clot firmness (MCF). Our study demonstrates that ROTEM is sensitive to exercise-induced hemostatic alterations. The method appears to be capable of detecting even distinct changes in hemostasis in a single-step procedure. Further analyses are needed to clarify which hemostasis parameters influence ROTEM results and which ROTEM results are independent predictors of exercise-induced alterations of plasmic and platelet function. This might help to explain interindividual differences in exercise-induced alterations of hemostasis."

The colloid solutions tested (3.5% polygeline (Haemaccel) and 4% succinylated gelatin (Gelofusine)) produced clots that had reduced median weight (P < 0.001 and P = 0.018, respectively) and reduced mean shear modulus (P < 0.001) compared with crystalloid controls. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the fibrin formed a less extensive mesh in the presence of the gelatin-based colloids compared with crystalloid. Reduction in clot quality with gelatin-based colloids has not been noted previously and further work is needed to ascertain if this occurs in vivo as these solutions are used frequently in patients who require full haemostatic competence."

All of these factors can induce venous stasis of the legs, which may lead to postoperative deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). The objectives of this study were to assess the degree of hypercoagulability and to determine the rate of postoperative DVT in a group of 100 patients in whom LC was completed. Whole-blood thrombelastography (TEG) and plasma-activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) determination were carried out preoperatively and on the 1st postoperative day. All patients received pre-, intra-, and postoperative graduated compression stockings and sequential pneumatic compression devices until fully ambulatory. Twenty-six percent of the patients with a risk score > 4, or a post-operative TEG index > +5.0, received subcutaneous heparin (5,000 units b.i.d.), beginning in the postoperative period and continuing for 4 weeks as an outpatient. A complete venous duplex scan of both legs was performed on the 7th postoperative day, at the time of their office visit. Our results revealed significant postoperative hypercoagulability for the TEG index (P < 0.005) and for PTT (P < 0.05). One patient had an asymptomatic DVT (1%), and no side effects from the mechanical or pharmacological prophylaxis occurred in this series. These data suggest that the low incidence of thrombosis in the face of theoretical and laboratory evidence of postoperative hypercoagulability may reflect an effective prophylactic regime.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010438,0,1771408,0,Comparative studies on various assays for the laboratory evaluation of r-hirudin.,"Several laboratory methods are available to measure r-hirudin, including clot-based, amidolytic, immunologic, and physicochemical techniques. The global tests, such as the PT, APTT, and Heptest, did not show an adequate response to r-hirudin in the range of 0.5 to 10.0 micrograms/ml, where full anticoagulation is achieved, as determined by animal models of thrombosis. The 10 U/ml thrombin time assay was very sensitive to r-hirudin, whereas the 10 U/ml calcium thrombin time gave a dose-dependent response from 0.15 to 10.0 micrograms/ml. Whole blood clotting assays (ACT, TEG) effectively measured r-hirudin levels up to 25 micrograms/ml. The amidolytic anti-Factor IIa assay, specific for evaluating direct thrombin inhibition, was very effective, particularly when modified to decrease the sample: thrombin ratio for higher r-hirudin concentrations. This assay may be useful in quality control, since it is biochemically defined and reagents are easily standardized. Thrombin generation assays based on synthetic substrates showed limited effect of r-hirudin; however, assays based on TAT complex and prothrombin fragment F1+2 generation showed a dose-dependent response. Immunologic methods (ELISA) are under development. Since these assays measure both complexed and noncomplexed hirudin, and since they are only sensitive to submicrogram levels, they may only be useful for the direct quantitation of absolute levels of r-hirudin but not for monitoring clinical anticoagulation. Thus, thrombin-based clotting, amidolytic, and immunologic assays can be used to evaluate and measure r-hirudin. However, optimization of each assay to respond to high and low concentrations of r-hirudin and their application to clinical monitoring, batch control, and standardization needs to be determined."

CD010438,0,19012951,0,Calibrated automated thrombin generation and modified thromboelastometry in haemophilia A.,Global coagulation tests may have a better relation with phenotype in haemophilia than traditional coagulation tests. These include the Calibrated Automated Thrombin generation assay (CAT) and modified thromboelastometry using low tissue factor triggering. Both have shown marked variability in thrombin generation and clot formation profiles respectively despite similar FVIII:C levels and have been suggested as means to monitor treatment. Data with modified thromboelastometry are largely limited to severe and moderate haemophiliacs. CAT measurements in haemophilia are generally performed at low TF concentrations (1 pM) because of a higher sensitivity for the intrinsic pathway at this concentration but is also sensitive for FVIII at higher concentrations (5 pM) and this has the advantage that inhibition of contact factor activation can be avoided. No formal comparison of both TF concentrations has been reported and the data on modified thromboelastometry in mild haemophilia are limited.

CD010438,0,9676926,0,Comparative study of different biological glues in an experimental model of surgical bleeding in anesthetized rats: platelet-rich and -poor plasma-based glue with and without aprotinin versus commercial fibrinogen-based glue.,"The use of fibrin glue in cardiovascular surgery has been associated with decreased operative time, effective control of localized bleeding, and reduced postoperative blood loss. All preparations of fibrin glue mimic the final common pathway of the coagulation cascade in which fibrinogen is converted to fibrin in the presence of thrombin and calcium. The goal of the study was to compare five different types of fibrin glue, with or without aprotinin, on a surgical bleeding model in the rat. In 70 anesthetized Wistar rats, after laparotomy, a 3 cm liver incision was performed. After randomization, seven groups were studied. In the first group, Biocol was used as a pinpoint application to the bleeding site. Four groups received a fibrin glue obtained from a single human donor plasma using Cell Saver V (Haemonetics). The sealant was applied as a two-component system. The first component of the glue was either platelet-rich-plasma (PRP) or platelet-poor-plasma (PPP). The second component consisted of a mixture of 0.5 ml CaCl 10% with 1000 U of human thrombin, with or without 400KUI of aprotinin (AP). The last two groups, control and aprotinin were treated using saline solution or topical aprotinin respectively. Hemoglobin and hematocrit were measured before surgery and 30 min after application of the glue. The decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) was the primary efficacy variable. Before surgery, there was no difference regarding Hb and Hct values between groups. Thirty min after the application of the glue, the decrease in hemoglobin expressed as percent of the control values is only significantly lower in the Biocol group when compared to control. No significant difference was observed with the other groups in comparison to control. The commercial fibrin glue (Biocol) is more efficient than other preparations. This efficacy is likely due to a higher fibrinogen concentration."
CD010438,0,18957002,0,Successful use and dosing of bivalirudin after temporary total artificial heart implantation: a case series.,"The temporary total artificial heart (TAH-t) has emerged as an effective bridge to transplantation for individuals with biventricular failure. Implantation of a TAH-t creates a hypercoagulable state requiring a multidrug approach that includes low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH) in order to minimize thromboembolism. A concern with UFH is the development of heparin-dependent antibodies, which develop in up to 50% of patients receiving the drug as part of cardiopulmonary bypass. If UFH therapy continues postoperatively, the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia approaches 3%. Small investigations have demonstrated that bivalirudin, given as a bolus of 0.75-1 mg/kg followed by an infusion at 1.75-2.5 mg/kg/hour, is an effective alternative to UFH for therapeutic anticoagulation during coronary artery bypass surgery, valve replacement, or both. We describe a series of five adults (age range 24-58 yrs) who received bivalirudin as an alternative to low-dose UFH after TAH-t implantation. None of the patients had documented heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Treatment was started at the discretion of the treating physician, and adjustments were based principally on the results of thromboelastography. Additional general monitoring included activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, fibrinogen, D-dimer, platelet count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet aggregation studies. Bivalirudin therapy was continued until successful warfarin implementation. All five patients received bivalirudin in addition to standard antithrombotic therapy. Bivalirudin treatment started at a dosage of 0.005 or 0.01 mg/kg/hour with titration to maintain normocoagulability, which occurred (without concomitant warfarin therapy) within the dosage range of 0.01-0.02 mg/kg/hour. Duration of TAH-t implantation was a mean of 38.8 days (range 25-60 days), and bivalirudin was continued for a mean of 15.2 days (range 7-24 days). No major hemorrhagic events occurred during treatment, and all patients successfully transitioned to warfarin therapy. Low-dose bivalirudin, as an alternative to UFH, maintained normocoagulability after TAH-t implantation. Further investigation is warranted to define the role and dosing of bivalirudin in this situation."
CD010438,0,10450445,0,The role of thromboelastography in the management of children with snake-bite in southern Africa.,"In the absence of a direct laboratory test of envenomation, there is a need for an alternative mechanism for the early recognition of envenomation following snake-bite in children. A severe clinical diathesis may result either from envenomation or from the release of an inappropriate tourniquet applied as 'first-aid' often several hours before presentation to hospital. Abnormalities of clotting are associated with both events. A normal thromboelastogram (TEG) provides early recognition of patients in whom the clinical course is likely to be benign (sensitivity = 94%). An abnormal TEG identifies patients of whom 50% will develop a severe clinical diathesis. A TEG is a more accurate predictor of disease severity than International Normalized Ratio alone. The TEG does not supplant clinical observation in the management of snake-bite in children but allows stratification into high- and low-risk categories."

This prospective study documents the TEG findings in 103 neonates: 60 were normal and healthy and provided a reference range; 12 surgical babies had established sepsis, 15 had early sepsis, and 16 were non-septic. TEG abnormalities were detected only in those patients with early and established sepsis. Abnormalities were found in all but 1 of this group of 27 patients (96%), whereas only 16 (59%) had thrombocytopenia, 2 (6%) had leukocytosis, and 6 had leukopenia. The TEG had a sensitivity for sepsis of 96% and a specificity of 96%. This exceeds the values for routine full blood-count parameters and other laboratory indicators of sepsis. It was found to be a simple, quick, and sensitive indicator of early sepsis that enabled the clinicians to manage septic newborns earlier."

The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in TEG parameters in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients. Thirty nine patients with ITP (platelet count < 100 × 103  µl⁻¹) were included in the study. Age-matched 17 patients with thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy were selected as a control group. Platelet count was positively correlated with maximum clot formation (MCF) in INTEM (r = 0.716, p < 0.001) and MCF in EXTEM (r = 0.679, p < 0.001); negatively correlated with clot formation time (CFT) in INTEM (r = -0.755, p < 0.001) and CFT in EXTEM (r = -0.585, p < 0.001) in ITP patients. Platelet count was positively correlated with MCF in INTEM (r = 0.776, p < 0.001) and MCF in EXTEM (r = 0.878, p < 0.001); negatively correlated with CFT in INTEM (r = -0.627, p < 0.001) in control group. Receiver operating characteristic curves to describe the critical platelet count and fibrinogen level that affect MCF revealed 31 × 103 µl⁻¹ and 375 mg dl⁻¹ as cut-off values, respectively. In conclusion, ROTEM determines the contribution of fibrinogen and platelets to clot strength in patients with ITP. MCF appears to be the most important TEG parameter in predicting bleeding in ITP patients that makes TEG superior to other hemostatic tests."

The diffuse haemorrhage was initially treated with replacement of coagulation factors.

Thereafter, blood was analyzed by using modified thrombelastograph coagulation analysis (ROTEG) and clotting time, clot formation time, and maximal clot firmness were determined. RL had the least effect on hemostasis. Gelatin administered alone impaired the coagulation system significantly less than each median-weight HES administered alone. We conclude that gelatin combined with 6% HES 200/0.5 or 6% HES 130/0.4 decreases hemostasis <6% HES 200/0.5 or 6% HES 130/0.4 administered alone."
CD010438,0,21308350,0,Diverse inhibition of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 by theaflavins of black tea.,"Fruits, vegetables, spices and a variety of teas are suggested for the prevention of many diseases. They encompass active, non-nutritional ingredients called nutraceuticals which are defined as food products that provide health benefits. Many nutraceuticals have been tested to identify inhibitors of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). PAI-1 is the major and fast acting physiological inhibitor of fibrinolysis. However, preclinical studies of PAI-1 inhibitors have revealed an additional role of PAI-1 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling, renal injury, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Thus PAI-1 is a potential therapeutic target in some of these diseases. Our previous study revealed that a black tea extract (containing mostly theaflavins) inhibits PAI-1. In this study we report results for four pure (>98%) theaflavins. Inactivation of PAI-1 was tested by clot formation and by its lysis using thromboelastometry and measurements of human plasma turbidity. Among four tested theaflavins, theaflavin-3'-gallate was the most potent in PAI-1 inhibition trailed by theaflavin-3,3'-digallate, while the other two i.e., theaflavin and theaflavin-3-gallate did not show inhibitory activity."

The feasibility of the designed construct is demonstrated by functionalizing the TX tiles with one biotin-triethylene glycol (TEG) and efficiently decorating them with streptavidin, and furthermore by positioning and anchoring single thiol-modified B-A-B complexes to certain locations on a chip via dielectrophoretic trapping. Finally, we characterize the conductance properties of the non-functionalized construct, first by measuring DC conductivity and second by utilizing AC impedance spectroscopy in order to describe the conductivity mechanism of a single B-A-B complex using a detailed equivalent circuit model. This analysis also reveals further information about the conductivity of DNA structures in general."

Thirty-one children with severe cyanosis (hematocrit ≥54%), who were diagnosed as having transposition of the great arteries or double outlet right ventricle with or without pulmonary valve stenosis, and underwent arterial switch operation or double roots transplantation, were involved and were divided into two groups. In group F (n=17), the transfusion therapy after cardiopulmonary bypass was performed with fibrinogen administration combined with traditional transfusion, guided by TEG. In group C (n=14), traditional transfusion guided by clinical experiences only was performed. We observed the blood protection effects and recovery conditions of these patients. In surgery, compared with group C, the chest closure time, fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), and platelet (PLT) volume used at closure time had no significant reductions in group F (P>0.05, respectively), and the patients in group F had no significant reductions in the amount of chest drainage (P>0.05). The total PLT and total red blood cells usage were also the same (P>0.05). But during the first 24h, FFP usage in the intensive care unit (ICU) and total perioperative FFP usage had significantly dropped in group F (P<0.05); the mechanical ventilator time, ICU stay, and hospitalization time in group F were much shorter than those in group C (P<0.05). So, TEG was effective in perioperative blood protection. Fibrinogen could be a substitute for FFP to restore hemostasis and improve the prognosis for these patients."
CD010438,0,2438639,0,Action of hormonal contraceptives on the coagulation system and some of its inhibitors.,"Changes in the level of inhibitors of the coagulation system, primarily of thrombin neutralizing factors have been studied during the prolonged use of four products of contraceptive preparations containing various amounts of oestrogens and progestogens, two fixed dose pills (Bisecurin, Ovidon), a low dose combination pill (Rigevidon) and a biphasic preparation (Anteovin). Thrombelastographic values referred to hypercoagulability while the results of other examinations indicating activation of the coagulation system did not show definite changes in comparison with the control. The activity and quantity of antithrombin III decreased but never below 80%. Except Anteovin all contraceptives significantly enhanced alpha 1-antitrypsin while alpha 2-macroglobulin levels, remained nearly the same as the control values. Attention is called to that the increased alpha 1-antitrypsin level may be a biochemical risk factor. The results showed that the increased coagulability and disposition to thromboembolic disorders caused by hormonal contraceptives may be attributed not only to the decrease of thrombin inhibitors but also to increased alpha 1-antitrypsin levels which may cause increased inhibition of the fibrinolytic system."

CD010438,0,23184724,0,Carbohydrate structure dependent hemocompatibility of biomimetic functional polymer brushes on surfaces.,"Glycocalyx mimicking glycopolymer brushes presenting mannose, galactose and glucose residues in the pyranose form, similar to those present on cell surfaces, were synthesized on planar substrates (Si wafer, gold chip) and monodispersed polystyrene (PS) particles, and the interaction of blood to these surfaces were studied using various methods with the goal of producing a hemocompatible surface. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and gel analyses showed that the total protein adsorption from plasma was greatly reduced, as low as 24.3 ng/cm(2) from undiluted plasma on the glucose carrying brush. The protein adsorption decreased with increasing grafting density of the brushes. It was also found that the protein adsorption varied with the anticoagulant used for blood collection; much higher amount of protein was adsorbed from heparinzied plasma than citrated plasma. Proteomics protein identification analysis revealed that protein adsorption from plasma depended on the type of sugar residue present on the surface as well as the type of anticoagulant. All the three types of glycopolymer brushes showed similar level of platelet activation as that of buffer control irrespective of the nature of carbohydrate residue. However, the number of adhered platelet and their morphology depended on the type of carbohydrate residue present on the brush. On glucose brush, the extent of platelet adhesion and spreading was significantly lowered compared to other brushes. All the glycopolymer brushes were neutral to blood coagulation as indicated by thromboelastography analysis. The glucose brush gave a slightly longer initial coagulation time suggesting that this surface may be more biocompatible. Our data demonstrate that the structure of carbohydrate residue is an important factor in the design of synthetic blood contacting surface based on glycopolymer."
CD010438,0,21535978,0,[Hyperfibrinolysis as the cause of haemorrhage and increased mortality in trauma patients].,Trauma-associated coagulopathies are at times present upon arrival at the emergency department. Hyperfibrinolysis is a condition in which the natural ability to dissolve blood clots is pathologically enhanced. It is present in 2-8% of trauma patients and associated with shock and increased mortality. Hyperfibrinolysis is easily detected by thromboelastography. The condition is treated with antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid--whereas transfusion with blood products is inefficient. This article explores the mechanisms and diagnostics of hyperfibrinolysis in trauma patients and the relevant treatment options.

We combined this monitor with platelet count (PLT), activated clotting time (ACT) and thromboelastography (TEG) and devised a hematologic monitoring system for bedside use. This study of 10 adults undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass was conducted to determine the utility of this monitoring system. The specificity for lotting abnormality of this monitoring system included the following values; PT = 88%, FIB = 100% and TEG = 67%. This study suggests that this monitoring system may be useful in early diagnosis and treatment of postoperative coagulopathy."

It is a laboratory instrument, with no facility for patient connection. Because of its minimal size and weight, it is easily stored in a cramped laboratory. Its automated programs are appropriate for processing of bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells, and it is quite easy to learn how to use (in our laboratory, most individuals have been completely facile with the SteriCell after fewer than six processings). Based on reported results from other instruments, the SteriCell provides cell yields that are comparable to competing instruments. Service (provided by Haemonetics) has been satisfactory, and support from Terumo has been excellent. We can recommend this instrument to any other laboratory."

CD010438,0,11583738,0,Comparison of the effect of different platelet GPIIb/IIa antagonists on the dynamics of platelet/fibrin-mediated clot strength induced using thromboelastography.,"The effect of various platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) antagonists on the dynamics of platelet-fibrin clot formation and strength induced by various stimuli was measured by thromboelastography (TEG). GPIIb/IIIa antagonists with high affinity for resting and activated platelets and with slow rates of dissociation from GPIIb/IIIa (Class I antagonists) demonstrated potent and comparable inhibition of platelet aggregation and tissue factor (TF), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Factor Xa, and thrombin-induced clot strength, in contrast to antagonists that dissociate rapidly from GPIIb/IIIa (Class II antagonists). For example, the Class I antagonist XV459 (the free acid form of roxifiban) inhibited TF, endotoxin, Factor Xa, and thrombin-induced maximal clot strength and platelet aggregation with an IC(50)=30-70 nM, whereas the IC(50) of the Class II antagonist YZ211 (the free acid form of sibrafiban) for altering clot formation and strength was 0.3-4.7 microM. Moreover, the IC(50)'s of sibrafiban, and another Class II antagonist, orbofiban, for inhibiting platelet-fibrin clot formation and strength were substantially greater than their clinically achievable concentrations. Further, although aspirin treatment improved the efficacy of all GPIIb/IIIa antagonists, it did not alter the differences between Classes I and II antagonists. Thus, these data indicate that there are differences in the efficacy of various GPIIb/IIIa antagonists in inhibiting platelet-fibrin clot formation and strength. They also suggest that inhibiting platelet aggregation may not be the sole determinant for the in vivo efficacy of various GPIIb/IIIa antagonists."

CD010438,0,7233509,0,Donor platelet response and product quality assurance in plateletpheresis.,"Retrospective analysis of 352 donors who underwent plateletpheresis at least four times, each using the Haemonetics Model 30 Blood Processor, indicated that a postpheresis platelet count of less than 100,000/microliter occurred in only 2.7 per cent of phereses. Restricting pheresis to those with a prepheresis platelet count of greater than 150,000/microliter would have lowered this to 1.3 per cent and eliminated only 3.7 per cent of donations. The donors' platelet counts returned to baseline approximately four days and rebounded above baseline eight to eleven days after pheresis. To minimize the chance of a donor having a postpheresis platelet count less than 100,000/microliter, the prepheresis platelet count should be greater than 150,000/microliter. A platelet count greater than 150,000/microliter immediately following the previous pheresis can be used instead of the prepheresis platelet count. The yield was related to the prepheresis platelet count, number of cycles, sex, type of procedure (platelet or platelet-leukapheresis), and the yield recorded during an individual's previous procedures. Seventy-five per cent of plateletpheresis products contained more than 3.3 x 10(11) platelets. This might be a satisfactory standard for quality assurance."
CD010438,0,7233508,0,A new technique for the collection of plasma: machine plasmapheresis.,"The Haemonetics Model 50 permits the collection of 500 ml of plasma within an average of 30 minutes, and the donor is never disconnected from his cells. In a detailed assessment of 28 donors, we found no detrimental effect of the procedure. There was no evidence of fibrin split products or complement activation. The plasma showed good recovery of protein with slightly elevated factor VIII levels; citrate levels are only two-thirds of manual plasmapheresis values. While there was a relatively large number of platelets collected into this plasma, the platelets were small, with a mean diameter of 1.8 mu and poor response to aggregation. Therefore it would appear that this plasma should not be used to make a platelet preparation. Nonetheless, evaluation of this machine indicated that the performance parameters are acceptable and that donor acceptance is exceptional, with widespread enthusiasm for this ""new"" method of blood donation."

However, only around 30% of such patients actually have levels of malodor high enough to bother other people. Many patients exhibit halitophobia symptoms, which present as self-perception of malodor, and thus have a strong obsession about their smell which results in distress. Here, we carried out a study on 300 outpatients who visited the Tokyo Dental College Chiba Hospital Odor Clinic. We used the Tokyo University Egogram (TEG) to elucidate character traits of affected outpatients and compared the occurrence of TEG types in these patients with those of normal individuals. We discovered that 10.4% of patients were A-dominant type, which was 10.6% lower than the 21.0% of normal individuals. On the other hand, 18.4% of patients were N-type (NP high, FC low), which was 9.9% higher than the 8.5% of normal individuals. Results revealed that very few of the malodor outpatients exhibited the trait that shows intelligence, calm judgment, and self-affirmation, and as a result enjoy their life. Instead, many of these patients tended to show high levels of kindness and appeared to be holding themselves back and exercising patience."

These tests reflect only the initial phase of blood clotting, when <5% of thrombin has been formed.

This prospective, randomized study compared coagulation and blood loss during anaesthetic maintenance with target-controlled intravenous propofol infusion vs. inhaled isoflurane. Thirty-eight ASA I-III patients undergoing head and neck surgery were allocated randomly to receive either inhaled isoflurane at end-tidal concentration 1-1.5% (group I, n=20) or target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol at target concentration 2-5 microg ml(-1) (group P, n=18). Thrombelastography on recalcified whole blood was performed pre-induction, and at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 min post-induction and 30 min after anaesthesia in both groups. Blood loss was estimated from weighing swabs and the volume in suction bottles. Induced hypotension was not used, and perioperative body temperature was similar between groups. There were no significant differences in thrombelastographic coagulation (R-time, K-time, maximum amplitude and angle) or fibrinolytic variables (lysis index at 30 and 60 min) at all times between groups. Total blood loss was also not significantly different (median group I: 350 ml, range 20-1200 ml; group P: 200 ml, range 50-800 ml). Shortening of R-time and widening of angle developed over time in both groups (P<0.05 groups I and P, repeated measures ANOVA). We conclude that maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol TCI at 2-5 microg ml(-1) does not cause detectable coagulation changes on thrombelastography nor increase surgical blood loss when compared to inhaled isoflurane."

In Phase I, AF was collected from 29 women undergoing cesarean section. Nine experiments were performed. Forty-milliliter aliquots of pooled AF were mixed with 125 mL of packed red blood cells and processed in the Cell Saver. In Phase II, all the blood and AF lost at cesarean section was collected and processed through the Cell Saver. Pre- and postwash specimens were collected and analyzed for total tissue factor concentration and the concentration of functionally active tissue factor. In Phase I, total tissue factor concentration was reduced by 89%, and the concentration of active tissue factor was reduced to 0 after processing. In Phase II, no tissue factor was detected after processing through the Cell Saver. We have demonstrated the ability of the Haemonetics 4 Cell Saver System to remove tissue factor activity from blood contaminated with AF."
CD010438,0,6500033,0,[Effect of heparin on the aggregation function of thrombocytes].,"It has been demonstrated in experiments in vitro that addition of heparin to platelet enriched plasma potentiates the ADP-induced platelet aggregation and that heparin itself can provoke aggregation of platelets. Heparin exerts an inhibitory action on the thrombin-induced aggregation, which seems likely to be associated with its inhibitory effect on thrombin, an inducer of aggregation. It has been discovered that heparin action on the hemostasis is determined by its concentration. The doses under 0.05 U/ml enhance the ADP-induced platelet aggregation and accelerate the time of blood coagulation, whereas the doses from 0.3 to 2 U/ml exert a more powerful effect on aggregation, inhibiting blood coagulation."

CD010438,0,11369429,0,Induction of acquired factor IX inhibitors in cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis): a new primate model of hemophilia B.,"Inherited hemophilia dog and other transient hemophilic animal models have been used for evaluation of hemostatic agents for use in treatment of hemophilia. We established the first nonhuman primate hemophilic model by immunizing cynomolgus monkeys with human FIX (hFIX) in adjuvants. FIX activities of all three hFIX-immunized monkeys decreased transiently to less than 10% in accordance with prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Forty micrograms of human factor VIIa (hFVIIa) per kilogram body weight (that was reported to be clinically effective) was administered to the monkey with the highest inhibitor titer to evaluate its usefulness as a hemophilia inhibitor model. Results of thromboelastography (TEG) after the injection demonstrated that the hemostatic effect of FVIIa in this model would be similar to that in hemophiliacs with inhibitors. The antibodies purified from the monkey's plasma by hFIX-immobilized gel were composed of two types: Ca(2+)-dependent and -independent antibodies, with features of IgG(1) and IgG(4). Both types of antibodies reacted to cynomolgus FIX, and only Ca(2+)-dependent antibodies also expressed inhibitory activity against cynomolgus FIX. Immunoblotting analyses of Ca(2+)-dependent antibodies using hFIX and its derivatives suggested that they recognized the Ca(2+)-dependent conformation related to the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain. Comparison of FIX cDNA from human, cynomolgus monkey, and other species, and the results of immunization of various animals (goats, beagle dogs, rabbits, and rats) with hFIX in adjuvants strongly suggested that the development of acquired FIX inhibitors in the monkeys might be due to high cross-reactivity of the antibodies to molecular mimic antigens, hFIX, and cynomolgus FIX."

Cells isolated by this process which uses centrifuge tubes may become contaminated. In 19 studies in our laboratory we used Ficoll-Hypaque treatment to isolate mononuclear cells from cellular residues obtained during plateletpheresis using a modified 600-ml polyvinyl-chloride (PL-146) plastic bag with the Haemonetics blood processor V-50 or the Fenwal CS-3000 blood processor. The 600-ml PVC plastic bag was modified by sealing its vertical edges using radio frequency to form a narrow bag with a volume of approximately 200 ml. A 125-volume of diluted apheresis cellular residue was collected, and the mononuclear cells were isolated as follows: the diluted cellular residue was layered onto 75 ml of Ficoll-Hypaque with a specific gravity of 1.077 and was centrifuged at 260 g for 30 min at 22 degrees C. The supernatant plasma was removed. The mononuclear cell layer was transferred to a sterile 600-ml transfer bag, and the cells were washed with saline. Of the 4.24 +/- 0.9 X 10(9) mononuclear cells applied to the gradient, approximately 3.73 +/- 0.8 X 10(9) cells were recovered. The recovered cells consisted of 77.3 +/- 8% lymphocytes, 19.0 +/- 7% monocytes, and 3.6 +/- 3% granulocytes. There was no significant difference in tissue culture growth in the CFU-GEMM assay of mononuclear cells whether the plastic tube or the plastic bag system was used. Aerobic bacteriologic cultures were negative. The PL-146 plastic bag system used in this study proved to be a significant aid in isolating mononuclear cells from plateletpheresis residue."

CD010438,0,20618331,0,Point-of-care testing in haemostasis.,"Point-of-care testing (POCT) in haematology has seen a significant increase in both the spectrum of tests available and the number of tests performed annually. POCT is frequently undertaken with the belief that this will reduce the turnaround time for results and so improve patient care. The most obvious example of POCT in haemostasis is the out-of-hospital monitoring of the International Normalized Ratio in patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist, such as warfarin. Other areas include the use of the Activated Clotting Time to monitor anticoagulation for patients on cardio-pulmonary bypass, platelet function testing to identify patients with apparent aspirin or clopidogrel resistance and thrombelastography to guide blood product replacement during cardiac and hepatic surgery. In contrast to laboratory testing, POCT is frequently undertaken by untrained or semi-trained individuals and in many cases is not subject to the same strict quality control programmes that exist in the central laboratory. Although external quality assessment programmes do exist for some POCT assays these are still relatively few.

Three of the new donors have been functionalized with hydrophobic straight chain alkane units (C6, C12, and C18) while the remaining three have been functionalized with derivatized di-, tetra-, and hexaethylene glycol hydrophilic units (DEG, TEG, and HEG, respectively). The resulting self-assembled hydrophobic and hydrophilic supramolecular rectangles have been fully characterized by multinuclear NMR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Molecular force field modeling suggests that the functionalized rectangles range in size from roughly 3.0 x 2.9 to 3.0 x 6.0 nm2 in size."

CD010438,0,22788854,0,Quantification of circulating D-dimer by peptide immunoaffinity enrichment and tandem mass spectrometry.,"D-dimer is a product of the coagulation cascade and is associated with venous thromboembolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and additional clinical conditions. Despite its importance, D-dimer measurement has limited clinical utility due in part to the lack of reliable assays. The difficulty in developing an immunoassay that is specific for D-dimer arises from the inherent heterogeneity in its structure. In this report, we describe a highly specific method for the quantification of D-dimer level in human plasma. In our method, the reciprocally cross-linked peptide resulting from factor XIIIa-catalyzed dimerization of fibrin γ chains was selected to represent the D-dimer antigen. Using an antipeptide antibody, we enriched the cross-linked peptide from trypsin-digested plasma prior to quantitative analysis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The assay has a quantitative range of 500 pmol/L to 100 nmol/L in human plasma. In further characterization of the assay, we found that it exhibited good correlation with fibrinolytic activity in human donors and with thrombin generation and clot strength in an in vitro thromboelastography assay. These observations thus establish the biological relevance of the assay and suggest it may be a valuable biomarker in characterization and treatment of blood coagulation disorders."

CD010438,0,8463805,0,Effect of delay and storage on whole-blood clotting analysis as determined by thrombelastography.,"The thrombelastogram (TEG) measures the viscoelastic properties of clotting blood, displaying a visual trace of all phases of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Thrombelastography can be performed on whole blood (WBTEG) or on citrated blood or plasma, citrated samples facilitating delayed analysis but requiring recalcification of the sample. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of delay and storage method on WBTEG measurement. Thrombelastographic analysis of coagulation in whole blood was investigated after delays of 3 and 6 minutes in polystyrene syringes (PS3 and PS6) and 3 minutes in silicone-coated glass tubes (SG3). Thrombelastograms of the delayed samples were compared with those measured immediately. Silicone-coated glass tubes activated coagulation, as seen by shorter r times (p < 0.01), shorter r + k times (p < 0.01), and larger maximum amplitude (ma) values (p < 0.01) compared with TEG values determined immediately after sampling. In the SG3 group, 20% of samples had clotted by 3 minutes, and the use of SG tubes for this purpose cannot be recommended. A delay of 6 minutes in PS had less effect on the activation of clotting in the earlier stages in that the r time was prolonged (p < 0.01). However, there appeared to be some activation later in that k time was shorter (p < 0.01) and ma was wider (p < 0.05). Overall, a 3-minute delay in PS produced the best values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

While these strategies meet the specification for WBC reduction (< 5 x 10(6) WBCs/unit), the products from these processes may differ depending on the process employed and its performance. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate whether PCs prepared using various WBC-reduction processes are sufficiently depleted of WBCs to limit cytokine accumulation during storage and to assess if cytokine levels detected in platelet products can serve as indicators of acceptable platelet activation as a result of the WBC-reduction process."

CD010438,0,15321411,0,In vitro evidence of gender-related heparin resistance.,"Coagulability varies among men, women, and pregnant women, along a spectrum where the blood of men is the least and that of pregnant women the most coagulable. The effects of differences in coagulation status on the action of heparin cannot be measured by specific laboratory tests such as aPTT or anti-Factor Xa assay. Thromboelastography which measures whole blood coagulation can assess the effect of heparin against differing backgrounds of coagulation. The aim of this in vitro study was to explore differences in heparin effect between men, women and pregnant women. Fifteen male and female staff volunteers, and 15 pregnant women approaching term, donated venous blood, which was added to four cups in two TEG 5000 analysers. In the cups of the analysers was 0.03 mL of saline control, or heparin 0.4, 0.6 or 1 unit/mL. TEG variables r and k, angle and MA were compared across the groups using two way ANOVA. All subject groups demonstrated a significant heparin effect, which was least in the control group and greatest with 1 unit/mL (P < 0.0001). Across the subject groups, from men to pregnant women, increasing coagulability was seen, with shortening of r and k (P < 0.04), and increasing angle and MA (P < 0.0001). A relationship between gender and heparin was significant for r and k (P < 0.02) but not for angle and MA. This result assists the case against a one-size-fits-all approach to policies on heparinisation."

Killer cells were intra-arterially infused, as a primary therapy, in 5 patients with maxillary and one with lingual cancer (squamous cell carcinoma). Effects on reduction of primary tumour size were significantly high without any severe side effects. The effects were interpreted mainly by direct day-by-day observation of the site, findings of CT and histology. Histological findings of the tissue obtained by surgical operation performed after adoptive immunotherapy were remarkable changes, such as infiltration of lymphoid cells around the cancer nets, degeneration of cancer cells, infiltration of scavenger macrophages (giant cells) and so on. The results suggested that adoptive immunotherapy by the killer cells can be a powerful treatment to bring the cancer under control, in with combination of other therapies."

Data of a group of 15 normal donors were pooled and analyzed. Our results showed that Haemonetics-isolated platelets had the following altered in vitro functions. Adenosine diphosphate-induced aggregation was markedly reduce, and epinephrine-induced aggregation was often absent. Collagen-induced aggregation was characterized by prolongation of the aggregation time and, sometimes, also by reduction of aggregation. Increase of adenosine diphosphate or collagen concentration resulted in improvement of aggregation of Haemonetics-collected platelets; increase of epinephrine concentration had no effect. Exogenous CaCL2, pre-Haemonetics platelet-rich or platelet-poor plasma failed to correct the abnormal aggregation of post-Haemonetics platelets.

CD010438,0,17762530,0,"Recombinant activated factor VII effectively reverses the anticoagulant effects of heparin, enoxaparin, fondaparinux, argatroban, and bivalirudin ex vivo as measured using thromboelastography.","Bleeding is the major adverse reaction to anticoagulants, leading to significant morbidity and even mortality. Protamine is a specific antidote for heparin yet is only partially effective for enoxaparin, and the activated factor X inhibitor fondaparinux and the direct thrombin inhibitors argatroban and bivalirudin lack specific antidotes. We evaluated the ability of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), a general hemostatic agent, to reverse the anticoagulant effects of heparin, enoxaparin, fondaparinux, argatroban, and bivalirudin, as measured by thromboelastography. Whole-blood samples containing each test anticoagulant, with or without rFVIIa 1.5-4.5 microg/ml, were prepared ex vivo (n >or= 48, each anticoagulant) and analyzed by thromboelastography. The thromboelastography parameters of clot initiation, propagation, rigidity and elasticity were compared for the ex-vivo samples for each anticoagulant. The reversal ability of rFVIIa was also assessed using the standard clinical assay used to monitor each anticoagulant. Thromboelastography was performed on blood from eight stably anticoagulated patients, with and without exogenous rFVIIa. For each anticoagulant, rFVIIa significantly improved and, in some cases, completely normalized all thromboelastography parameters (P < 0.001). rFVIIa significantly (P < 0.01) decreased the activated partial thromboplastin time for argatroban-containing, bivalirudin-containing, or heparin-containing blood yet did not affect the anti-activated factor X levels for enoxaparin-containing or fondaparinux-containing blood. By thromboelastography, rFVIIa exerted generally similar reversal effects on the anticoagulated patient samples as on the ex-vivo samples. In conclusion, rFVIIa effectively reverses the anticoagulant effects of heparin, enoxaparin, fondaparinux, argatroban, and bivalirudin, and should be considered for patients with excessive bleeding associated with these anticoagulants."

Lag times were significantly shorter when a combination of collagen and endogenous thrombin was used to provoke platelet aggregation (41.9 +/- 16.3 s) compared with collagen (173.8 +/- 52.1 s, P < 0.0001) or endogenous thrombin (94.3 +/- 43.6 s, P < 0.001). Amplitudes and slopes were the lowest in collagen-induced experiments (2.83 +/- 1.59 Omega and 1.79 +/- 0.45 Omega/min, respectively), whereas they were approximately the same in endogenous thrombin-induced experiments whether collagen was present or not (13.7 +/- 3.1 versus 11.2 +/- 4.0 Omega and 6.3 +/- 2.8 versus 5.6 +/- 2.3 Omega/min, respectively). No synergistic effect of collagen and endogenous thrombin on the clot formation process was observed by means of thrombelastometry. Moreover, thrombin potentials in tissue factor-activated plasma samples were approximately the same whether collagen was present or not (834 +/- 67 versus 809 +/- 63 nmol/l.min). In conclusion, endogenously generated thrombin is a potent platelet agonist in whole blood, and a combination of collagen and endogenous thrombin synergistically shortens the lag time until the onset of platelet aggregation."
CD010438,0,11323357,0,The effect of magnesium on coagulation in parturients with preeclampsia.,"Preeclampsia is associated with complex coagulation abnormalities that include altered platelet function and consumption and activation of the fibrinolytic system. Magnesium sulfate, which is used as a therapeutic modality for the prevention of seizures in preeclamptic parturients, has anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects. We sought to determine the effects of magnesium on various components of the coagulation system in patients with preeclampsia. We assessed the coagulation status of 18 parturients with preeclampsia being treated with magnesium. The assessment was performed with the thromboelastograph test, which provides an overall assessment of blood coagulation via the coagulation index. Thromboelastography was performed before beginning magnesium therapy and 30 min and 2 h after a 6-g bolus of IV magnesium. The R value (time to first clot formation) was found to be significantly slower (P < 0.05) at 30 min after the magnesium bolus. This result suggests increased coagulant factor activity resulting from the magnesium bolus. However, there was no effect of magnesium on the overall coagulation, as evidenced by the lack of change in the coagulation index either at 30 min or at 2 h after the completion of the initial magnesium bolus. Therefore, this therapy should have no effect on the use of neuraxial techniques."

The authors examined the in vitro and in vivo function of platelets collected on the Haemonetics AutoSurge machine and stored for 5 days in two separate 1000-mL CLX bags. The average count per bag was 1.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(11) in approximately 200 mL of plasma. Immediately following collection, the platelet response to ADP and epinephrine represented 78 and 35 percent, respectively, of the preapheresis values. Aggregation to single stimuli subsequently decreased to 29 and 0 percent, respectively by Day 5. This response is equal to or better than the response reported with the Fenwal CS-3000, the only other plateletpheresis device routinely used for long-term storage. The pH of the preparations was well maintained throughout storage, and there was little alteration in hypotonic shock response or serotonin uptake. Serotonin release decreased consistently. The morphology scores indicated good maintenance of shape immediately following collection; this subsequently decreased after 5 days of storage. Bacterial cultures were negative in all instances. The 51Cr in vivo survival and recovery was good with 65.5 +/- 7.1 percent recovery and an average survival of 7.3 +/- 1.3 days (multiple hit; n = 5). The data indicate that storage of the Haemonetics plateletpheresis product is feasible and that the product is as good as others currently available."

CD010438,0,7742784,0,The effects of pH on the generation of turbidity and elasticity associated with fibrinogen-fibrin conversion by thrombin are remarkably influenced by sialic acid in fibrinogen.,"In fibrinogen-fibrin conversion by thrombin, the polymerization of a fibrin monomer is accompanied by gelation and an increase turbidity. Since sialic acids at the terminal of the carbohydrate chains bound to fibrinogen are part of the low affinity calcium binding site necessary for polymerization, they are closely involved in the network structure of fibrin clots. Fibrin clots derived from asialofibrinogen exhibited definite differences in turbidity and elasticity compared with those derived from intact fibrinogen, and were markedly dependent on the pH during the reaction. The turbidity during polymerization of fibrin, evaluated according to the absorbance at 350 nm, was maximum at pH 6.5-7.0, but it decreased in the other pH ranges, with the changes being unremarkable at higher pH levels but remarkable at lower pH ranges. The turbidity of fibrin derived from asialofibrinogen was far higher than that from intact fibrinogen near neutrality, but decreased rapidly and was lower than in intact fibrinogen at higher and lower pH ranges. Concerning the elasticity evaluated by thromboelastography, the coagulation time (k) and the maximum amplitude (ma) were lower in asialofibrinogen, indicating a deterioration of the clotting function of fibrinogen with the loss of sialic acid. These results suggest that sialic acid bound to fibrinogen is closely related to the fibrin network formation in blood coagulation, which is the most important function of fibrinogen, and plays a functional role in the stabilization of fibrin clot formation against environmental changes, including pH."

She required up to 60 units/kg/hr of heparin to keep her heparin level within the target range at .3-.7 units/mL. During the ECMO course, substantial thrombus formation was observed within the venous site of the ECMO cannula, which led to two circuit changes on ECMO day 9 and day 20. On ECMO day 15, she was noticed to have purpuric lesions on her chest and her right hand with no obvious arterial or venous clot detected by Doppler ultrasound. She was also noted to have remarkable hemolysis as the plasma free hemoglobin levels were substantially elevated up to 700 mg/dL. She was noted to have continuous oozing from the catheter insertion sites despite adequate underlying coagulation status. Her subsequent platelet function analysis, the thromboelastography, and thromboelastography platelet mapping suggested substantial platelet dysfunction. Her von Willebrand panel revealed absence of high molecular weight multimers. Further coagulation workup was prompted which revealed heterozygosity for factor V Leiden.

This lectin has been used in combination with anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody (moAb) in a system for purging myeloma bone marrow. This has now been scaled up for application to ex vivo treatment of large volumes of bone marrow suitable for autologous bone marrow transplantation. Four bone marrow harvests from patients with myeloma containing 9.5 +/- 4.9% plasma cells were depleted of erythrocytes and mature granulocytes by Ficoll separation using the Haemonetics V50 cell separator. The mononuclear fraction was then purged with magnetic beads coated with PNA and anti-CD19 moAb. The system proved highly efficient with removal of all detectable plasma cells and CD19+ cells. Average mononuclear cell recovery following purging was 71% of the concentrated marrow with 78% yield of CFU-GM. Normal progenitor recovery related to patients' weight is predicted to be adequate for haemopoietic reconstitution following ablative chemoradiotherapy. This system is therefore feasible for large-scale clinical purging.
CD010438,0,3819793,0,Thromboelastography as an indicator of post-cardiopulmonary bypass coagulopathies.,"Postoperative hemorrhage in patients undergoing open-heart surgery is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Monitoring of coagulation in these patients has routinely involved the activated clotting time. Thromboelastography is currently used as a monitor of coagulation during liver transplantation. The thromboelastogram, by providing information on the interaction of all the coagulation precursors, gives more clinically useful information on coagulation than that available from the coagulation profile or the activated clotting time alone. This study was done to assess the usefulness of thromboelastography in open-heart surgery. Thirty-eight patients (29 undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and 9 undergoing valve replacement) were studied with activated clotting time, thromboelastography, and coagulation profiles during three periods: before bypass, during bypass, and after protamine administration. Thromboelastography was a significantly better predictor (87% accuracy) of postoperative hemorrhage and need for reoperation than was the activated clotting time (30%) or coagulation profile (51%). Thromboelastography is easy to use and provides diagnostic data within 30 minutes of blood sampling."

It is a speculation that nanometer size materials (approximately 50 nm) and a uniform size-distribution with highly crystallined phase may affect the excellent performances at high rate current densities."

CD010438,0,18707921,0,Effect of thrombocytapheresis on blood rheology in healthy donors: role of nitric oxide.,"Platelet transfusions are increasingly being used to treat thrombocytopenic conditions. Because of anticoagulation, changes in blood composition and extracorporeal circulation, donor apheresis may cause alterations in hemorheology. This study aimed at investigating the effects of thrombocytapheresis on donor blood rheology. The effect of nitric oxide (NO) on donor red blood cell (RBC) deformability after thrombocytapheresis was also studied. Platelets were collected by a Haemonetics MCS 3p cell seperator. Blood samples were obtained before and 15 min after thrombocytapheresis. RBC deformability and aggregation were measured using an ektacytometer, whole blood viscosity (WBV) was determined with a cone-plate rotational viscometer. Donor RBCs were shown to be less deformable at all stress levels except 0.30 Pa after thrombocytapheresis and NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 10(-6) M) reversed the reduced deformability caused by thrombocytapheresis. It was observed that donor apheresis induces a decrement in RBC aggregation and WBV measured at standard hematocrit (Hct). No significant alterations were observed in WBV values determined at native Hct values. Thrombocytapheresis also resulted in a decrement in fibrinogen, total protein, cholesterol and albumin levels whereas Hct was found to be increased and serum glucose, triglyceride, hemoglobin levels unaltered after apheresis. These results suggest that, thrombocytapheresis causes alterations in hemorheological parameters and hence in the perfusion of the microvasculature of the donors and NO appears to have a protective effect on the impairment observed in RBC deformability."

In order to identify those patients at high risk for increased intraoperative blood loss before operation, we determined predictive indicators of hyperfibrinolysis. We studied 56 cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplantation with the same anaesthetic procedure and transfusion regimen. The preoperative coagulation patterns of the 11 patients who experienced acute intraoperative hyperfibrinolytic activity were compared with those of the 45 patients who did not suffer this complication. Before surgery, patients with intraoperative hyperfibrinolysis had decreased prothrombin time (PT) and euglobulin lysis time (ELT), and increased thrombin time (TT) and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), whereas alpha angle and maximum amplitude (MA) were reduced on thrombelastography. Stepwise multivariate analysis disclosed three components which were significantly linked with occurrence of hyperfibrinolysis: TT, FDP and MA. Their sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values demonstrated that patients with FDP > or = 48 mg litre-1 and MA < or = 35 mm before incision had 100% probability of developing hyperfibrinolytic activity during transplantation."

Thrombocyte aggregation was markedly inhibited by carbenicilline; gentamycine had no influence. Thrombocyte adhesiveness was less influenced by both medicaments. The parameters of TEG, viz. reaction time, clotforming time, thrombus elasticity and index were compared before and after rotation and with and without medicaments. Under carbenicilline a prolongation of the clotforming time and a decrease of thrombus elasticity could be shown to exist after rotation. The impact of medicaments on the rotation thrombelastogramme can only be conceived by comparing the values before and after rotation in each case with and without medicament and not simply evaluating it, so that the rotation thrombelastogramms cannot be recommended to be used for assessing the disturbance of thrombocyte function induced by medicaments."

However, the contribution of platelets to the TEG profile has not been studied in detail. Blood was taken from eight healthy subjects and eight patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Immunomagnetic separation was achieved by the addition of Dynabeads labeled with a CD41 murine antibody (to the GPIIb/IIIa receptor) to achieve 90-100% depletion of platelets from blood. This was then titrated with whole blood to achieve platelet counts of approximately 0, 25 and 50% of the original count to compare with whole blood using TEG. Platelet function was also assessed by spontaneous platelet aggregometry (SPA) at baseline and at the 50% dilution. SPA, maximum amplitude (MA) and K time were significantly different in PAD patients compared to controls (P < 0.05). In both controls and PAD patients there was a strong linear correlation between Log10 [platelet count] and MA (r = 0.97 for controls, r = 0.89 for PAD) and K time (r = -0.86 for controls, r = -0.68 for PAD). Correlation between Log10 [platelet count] and R time was poor in both groups. The MA and K TEG parameters may be most useful for assessing platelet transfusion requirements."

Seventy-five patients (ASA I-III) who were to undergo major orthopedic procedures performed under epidural anesthesia were included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into three groups of 25 each for the administration of maintenance fluids: group RL (Ringer lactate), group HES (6% HES 130/0.4), and group JEL (4% gelofusine solution). Blood samples were obtained during the perioperative period before epidural anesthesia (t1, baseline), at the end of the surgery (t2), and 24 h after the operation (t3). TEG data, reaction time (R), coagulation time (K), angle value (α), and maximum amplitude (MA) were recorded. TEG parameters changed from normal values in all patients. In group RL, R and K times decreased compared to perioperative values while the α angle and MA increased (P < 0.05). In group HES, R and K times increased, however, the α angle and MA decreased (P < 0.05). In group JEL, R time increased (P < 0.05), but K time, α angle and MA did not change significantly. In the present study, RL, 6% HES (130/0.4) and 4% JEL solutions caused changes in the coagulation system of all patients as measured by TEG, but these changes remained within normal limits."

CD010438,0,19095614,0,Ex vivo coagulation test on tissue factor-expressing cells with a calibrated automated thrombogram.,"A calibrated automated thrombogram is not affected by the turbidity of platelet and cell preparations because the measurement is based on fluorescence. To examine conditions that mimic the physiological state, we investigated thrombograms that show thrombin generation on tissue factor (TF)-bearing cells. An increase in the number of J82 cells did not affect the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) of normal plasma, although the lag time (LT), the peak height, and the time to peak (ttPeak) did depend on cell concentration. When 5 parameters of coagulation factor-deficient plasmas were plotted on a radar graph, the thrombogram pattern of factor XI (FXI)-deficient plasma became slightly reduced. The thrombogram did not improve when washed normal platelets or washed normal platelets with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were added. FVII-depleted plasma, FVIII-deficient plasma, and FIX-deficient plasma showed remarkably reduced peak heights, ttPeaks, and times to the end of thrombin generation (start tails). The thrombogram of FVII-depleted plasma was characterized by a remarkably prolonged LT, unlike the patterns of FVIII- or FIX-deficient plasma and FXI-depleted plasma. The ETP of FVIII- and FIX-deficient plasma, but not FVII-depleted plasma, improved significantly upon addition of washed normal platelets or washed normal platelets with ADP. The thrombograms of coagulation factor-deficient plasma containing TF-bearing cells differed from those for recombinant TF and phospholipid in the liquid phase. We suggest that thrombograms using TF-bearing cells can be a useful ex vivo test, because this experimental model may be analogous to most coagulation processes in vivo."

After fixation with formalin, the brainstem was separated from the cerebrum and the cerebellum. Both junctions of midbrain-pons and pons-medulla were cut and then the pons was horizontally separated into four slices. The oral surface of the second slice from oral side, in which the central portion of the locus ceruleus is located, was measured with computed digitizer after enlarging the picture. The authors measured the total size of the slice in the pons (Total S), the tegmentum size (Teg S), the total length (Total L), the tegmentum length (Teg L) and so on. The tegmentum was separated from the base along the ventral line of the medial leminiscus.

At present the Haemonetics-Cell-Saver 3 is used to prepare autologous erythrocyte concentrates. When using this or similar, older, autotransfusion machines, the most dangerous hazard is venous air embolism during manual use despite blood centrifugation and preparation. To avoid this danger, the connecting tube to the patient must be clamped during filling of the autotransfusion bag. During autotransfusion the connecting tube between blood centrifuge and retransfusion bag must be clamped. The time loss due to this management has to be accepted. Regarding coagulation disorders, autotransfusion of large amounts of blood resembles massive transfusion with homologous blood. To maintain coagulation, hemostaseological parameters (Quick, thrombin time, ATIII) should be analyzed at the latest after replacement of half the estimated blood volume. On principle, blood components should be substituted only according to measured values. The substitution of ATIII is most frequently necessary to decrease the hazard of vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in these patients. The hazard of blood contamination by suctioning of operating room air should be considered. The number of operating room personnel should be as low as possible. Additionally, the suction device could be constructed to function only when necessary and not continuously.

The following coagulation parameters were measured for eight days: euglobulin lysis time (ELT), thromboelastography (TEG), vecalcification time (RECA), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), factor V, factor VIII, Normotest, Thrombotest, thrombin time, fibrinogen and platelets. Severe coagulation disorders were observed in one-third of the patients 12-48 hours after trauma. The abnormalities were more pronounced in patients who had sustained very severe injuries and arrived in a state of shock. The ELT was shortened 0-6 hours after the accident and accelerated coagulation was indicated simultaneously by decreased PTT, RECA, and r-values as well as by elevated Thrombotest and factor VIII values. The factor V and fibrinogen levels were initially lowered. Low platelet values at 2-4 days, prolonged thrombin and r-times, secondary decrease of fibrinogen FV, FVIII, and low Thrombotest values suggested disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with complications, such as fat embolism and ""shock lung"" syndromes.

The objective of this study was to ascertain the risks, benefits, and effects on transfusion rates associated with the use of intraoperative autologous transfusion (IAT) in this patient population. The Haemonetics Cell Saver 4 (Haemonetics Corporation, Braintree, MA) autotransfusion system was used to salvage blood in 18 patients undergoing the release of stenosed calvarial sutures. In a prospective, nonrandomized study, these patients were compared with a control group of similar age, gender, weight, and surgical procedures. There were 10 male patients and 8 female patients; the mean age was 7.2 months, the mean weight was 8.67 kg, and the mean surgical time was 3.15 hours. The mean amount of homologous blood transfused to the control group was 189 ml, compared with 87.69 ml for the IAT group, which was a decrease of 46.3%. The mean amount of autologous blood transfused was 150 ml (range, 50-250 ml). Thirty-three percent of the patients in the IAT group did not require homologous blood transfusion. No complications were observed with the use of the Cell Saver in the IAT group. The use of the Cell Saver was associated with a significant decrease in the amount and rate of homologous blood transfusions.

CD010438,0,17508711,0,Design and synthesis of efficient fluorescent dyes for incorporation into DNA backbone and biomolecule detection.,"We report here the design and synthesis of a series of pi-conjugated fluorescent dyes with D-A-D (D, donor; A, acceptor), D-pi-D, A-pi-A, and D-pi-A for applications as the signaling motif in biological-synthetic hybrid foldamers for DNA detection. The Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction and Knoevenagel condensation were demonstrated as the optimum ways for construction of long pi-conjugated systems. Such rodlike chromophores have distinct advantages, as their fluorescence properties are not quenched by the presence of DNA. To be incorporated into the backbone of DNA, the chromophores need to be reasonably soluble in organic solvent for solid-phase synthesis, and therefore a strategy of using flexible tetraethylene glycol (TEG) linkers at either end of these rodlike dyes was developed. The presence of TEG facilitates the protection of the chain-growing hydroxyl group with DMTrCl (dimethoxytrityl chloride) as well as the activation of the coupling step with phosphoramidite chemistry on an automated DNA synthesizer. To form fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs, six synthetic chromophores with blue to red fluorescence have been developed, and those with orthogonal fluorescent emission were chosen for incorporation into DNA-chromophore hybrid foldamers."
CD010438,0,15493055,0,Assessment of complement activation during membrane-based plasmapheresis procedures.,"Previous studies have suggested that plasmapheresis procedures using a separation membrane may activate the complement system and release anaphylatoxins. This study determines the content in C3a/C3a(des Arg) and C5a/C5a(des Arg) in plasma donations obtained by the new Haemonetics Filter Core (FC) procedure and compares it to Baxter Autopheresis C (Auto-C). FC performs sequential blood centrifugation and plasma filtration on a microporous polyethersulfone membrane, while Auto-C removes blood cells by simultaneous gravitation and filtration on a rotating nylon membrane. One group of 34 donors donated on FC and two groups of 30 and 10 donors on Auto-C. Plasma aliquots were taken from the plasma units within 30 min of the end of the collection procedures, frozen at < -30 degrees C and assessed for C3a and C5a at various time points of storage. Mean C3a/C3a(des Arg) in FC plasma (N = 34) was 1,151 (range: 526-2,991), 1,092 (range: 349-3498), and 507 (range: 307-815) ng/ml at time of collection and after 6 and 12 months of storage, respectively. Respective C5a/C5a(des Arg) was 26.6 (range 4.9-74), 18.9 (9.5-42.6), and 30.9 (range: 10.7-62.3) ng/ml. Mean C3a/C3a(des Arg) was higher in Auto-C (P < 0.001): 4,724 ng/ml (N = 10; range: 2,400-7 ,360) and > 4,149 ng/ml (N = 30; 2,408- > 6,430) after 3 and 18 months storage, respectively. Mean C5a/C5a(des Arg) was 32.1 ng/ml (N = 30; range: 10.6-57.2) after 18 months of storage. Complement activation in FC plasmas appears limited compared to Auto-C, suggesting better biocompatibility of this collection device and/or a favourable impact of the sequential cell centrifugation/filtration technology used. Further studies are needed to explain differences in complement activation between apheresis procedures and to assess clinical impacts, if any."
CD010438,0,18931200,0,A thromboelastometric evaluation of the effects of hypothermia on the coagulation system.,"Hypothermia may be accidental or therapeutic. Therapeutic hypothermia is increasingly used as treatment for various conditions, e.g., neuroprotection after cardiac arrest. Hypothermia leads to an impairment of the coagulation system, but the degree of impairment has been difficult to determine. Most studies have been performed on plasma instead of whole blood. We therefore evaluated whole blood investigating the effects of hypothermia on the coagulation system over a wide range of temperatures (25-40 degrees C)."
CD010438,0,20626354,0,Management of major blood loss: an update.,"Haemorrhage remains a major cause of potentially preventable deaths. Trauma and massive transfusion are associated with coagulopathy secondary to tissue injury, hypoperfusion, dilution and consumption of clotting factors and platelets. Concepts of damage control surgery have evolved, prioritizing the early control of the cause of bleeding by non-definitive means, while haemostatic control resuscitation seeks early control of coagulopathy. Haemostatic resuscitation provides transfusions with plasma and platelets in addition to red blood cells (RBCs) in an immediate and sustained manner as part of the transfusion protocol for massively bleeding patients. Transfusion of RBCs, plasma and platelets in a similar proportion as in whole blood prevents both hypovolaemia and coagulopathy. Although an early and effective reversal of coagulopathy is documented, the most effective means of preventing coagulopathy of massive transfusion remains debated and randomized controlled studies are lacking. Results from recent before-and-after studies in massively bleeding patients indicate that trauma exsanguination protocols involving the early administration of plasma and platelets are associated with improved survival. Furthermore, viscoelastic whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG)/rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM), appear advantageous for identifying coagulopathy in patients with severe haemorrhage, as opposed to conventional coagulation assays. In our view, patients with uncontrolled bleeding, regardless of its cause, should be treated with goal-directed haemostatic control resuscitation involving the early administration of plasma and platelets and based on the results of the TEG/ROTEM analysis. The aim of the goal-directed therapy should be to maintain a normal haemostatic competence until surgical haemostasis is achieved, as this appears to be associated with reduced mortality."
CD010438,0,9365861,0,Fingerstick blood samples in platelet donor screening: reliability and impact on predict yield programs.,"Although widely used, the reliability of fingerstick platelet counts for determining donor eligibility and for use with plateletpheresis predict yield programs has not been established. We compared platelet counts obtained from fingerstick vs. venous samples in several aspects of apheresis platelet collection. Analysis of 25 paired fingerstick and venous predonation samples demonstrated a poor correlation between platelet counts (r2 = .43), with fingerstick counts having a 20% lower mean value (P < .05). The effect of using fingerstick vs. venous predonation platelet counts with apheresis instrument predict yield calculations to obtain target yields was determined. Mean yields collected using fingerstick/predict yield were 12% (Fenwal CS3000 PLUS) and 15% (Haemonetics MCS+) higher than venous/predict yield units (P < .05). The coefficients of variation (CV) of fingerstick/predict yield and venous/predict yield collections were comparable (15% vs. 14% [CS3000] and 23% vs. 21% [MCS+], respectively), indicating that possible differences in accuracy between fingerstick and venous platelet counts had little effect on the variability of predict yield collections. A retrospective analysis of the CV of 100 fingerstick/predict yield units vs. 100 units collected by processing standard volumes showed no difference: 22% vs. 20% (F = 0.99, CS3000), and 22% vs. 24% (F = 0.89, MCS+), respectively. We conclude that fingerstick platelet counts are systematically lower and correlate poorly with venous counts, though their use seldom results in false disqualification of donors. We also conclude that fingerstick count/predict yield collections do not produce more consistent yields of platelets than standard volume collections."

Protamine directly inhibits thrombin and tissue factor (TF)-mediated activation of factor VII. However, the half-life of protamine is only 4.5 minutes; thus the purpose of this study was to determine if protamine could enhance fibrinolysis, explaining the delayed, protamine-associated hemorrhage observed in the postoperative period."
CD010438,0,842811,0,[Effect of a preoperative separation of platelets on the postoperative blood loss subsequent to extracorporeal circulation in open heart surgery (author's transl)].,"After operations with extracorporeal circulation there is a risk of clotting disorders, due to traumatisation of blood. The extent of cell damage are shown, in particular, by qualitative and quantitative impairment of platelet function. The clinical application of modern blood processors offer the possibility of selecting platelets from patients blood in the immediate preoperative period. Open heart operations were preceded by separation of platelets in 17 patients using a Haemonetics blood processor. After a postoperative retransfusion of the platelets an evident improvement in platelet function and a significant decrease in the predisposition to bleeding was demonstrated in the further postoperative period. During and after extracorporeal circulation the extent of microembolisation was registered by screen filtration pressure. In the clinical experiments, regularly, there is a significant increase of screen filtration pressure in the immediate postoperative period. These reactions were not seen in patients in whom preoperative separation of platelets was carried out. The most important clinical advantage of preoperative plateletpheresis consists in a significant decrease of postoperative blood loss. In particular the development of postperfusion lung will be prevented."
CD010438,0,11812703,0,Are lactated Ringer's solution and normal saline solution equal with regard to coagulation?,"Crystalloids represent an attractive strategy to alleviate intravascular volume deficits. Crystalloid hemodilution was associated with hypercoagulability in in vitro and in vivo studies. The influence of different crystalloids on coagulation in the surgical patient is not well studied. In a prospective, randomized study in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, we used either lactated Ringer's solution (RL) (n = 21) or 0.9% saline solution (SS) (n = 21) exclusively for intravascular volume replacement over 48 h to maintain central venous pressure between 8 and 12 mm Hg. Activated thrombelastography (TEG) using different activators (intrinsic TEG, extrinsic TEG, heparinase TEG, aprotinin TEG) was used to measure coagulation time, clot formation time, and maximum clot firmness. Measurements were performed after induction of anesthesia (T0), immediately after surgery (T1), 5 h after surgery (T2), and on the morning of the first (T3) and second (T4) postoperative days. RL 18,750 +/- 1890 mL and 17,990 +/- 1790 mL of SS were infused during the study period. Acidosis was seen only in the SS-treated group. Blood loss was not different between the groups. Fibrinogen and antithrombin III decreased similarly at T1 and T2 in both groups, most likely because of hemodilution. Differences in TEG data from normal baseline were seen only immediately after surgery and 5 h thereafter, indicating mild hypercoagulability in the intrinsic TEG (RL, from 147 +/- 130 s to 130 +/- 11 s; SS, from 146 +/- 12 s to 131 +/- 12 s). There were no differences in coagulation between RL- and SS-treated patients. We conclude that in major abdominal surgery intravascular volume replacement with crystalloids resulted in only moderate and abbreviated changes in coagulation. No differences in activated TEG and blood loss were seen between an RL- and an SS-based intravascular volume replacement regimen."

CD010438,0,2501890,0,Binding of tissue plasminogen activator to vascular grafts.,"Tissue plasminogen activator labeled with radioactive iodine (125I-tPA) was immobilized on vascular prostheses chemically modified with a thin coating of water-insoluble surfactant, tridodecylmethylammonium chloride (TDMAC). Surfactant-treated Dacron, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), silastic, polyethylene and polyurethane bound appreciable amounts of 125I-tPA (5-30 micrograms 125I-tPA/cm2). Upon exposure to human plasma, the amount of 125I-tPA bound to the surface shows an initial drop during the first hour of incubation, followed by a slower, roughly exponential release with a t 1/2 of approximately 75 hours. Prostheses containing bound tPA show fibrinolytic activity as measured both by lysis of clots formed in vitro, and by hydrolysis of a synthetic polypeptide substrate. Prior to incubation in plasma, tPA bound to a polymer surface has an enzymic activity similar, if not identical to that of the native enzyme in buffered solution. However, exposure to plasma causes a decrease in the fibrinolytic activity of both bound tPA and enzyme released from the surface of the polymer. These data demonstrate that surfactant-treated prostheses can bind tPA, and that these chemically modified devices can act as a slow-release drug delivery system with the potential for reducing prosthesis-induced thromboembolism."

CD010438,0,15155319,0,Heparinase-modified thrombelastography in term and preterm neonates.,"Thrombelastography (TEG) appears to be a promising test to assess coagulation in infants and children. TEG enables a rapid assessment of hemostatic function with only 300 microL of whole blood and provides information about plasmatic coagulation, platelet function, and fibrinolysis. In this study, we used TEG to assess the coagulation system of preterm and term neonates to determine the effects of their deficient coagulation factor levels on global hemostatic function. Heparinase-modified TEG, platelet and red blood cell count, plasma fibrinogen, and prothrombin time were assessed in four groups of clinically stable infants: severely preterm (gestational age [GA], 27-31 wk), moderately preterm (GA, 32-36 wk), term (GA, 36-40 wk), and former preterm (corrected GA, 34-40 wk). Healthy adult volunteers served as a control group. When compared with the adult group, thromboelastography revealed no defects in coagulation from groups of clinically stable infants, documenting the functional integrity of coagulation despite, in part, decreased conventional coagulation variables. Because clinically stable preterm and term infants show a relatively small incidence of bleeding, despite prolonged conventional coagulation tests, TEG may better reflect the hemostatic potential of these patients compared with conventional coagulation tests."

The addition of rFVIIa to factor II- or X-deficient plasma did not correct hemostatic parameters, whereas it produced partial responses in factor V-, VIII- or IX-deficient plasma and good responses in factor VII-, XI- or XII-deficient plasma. Furthermore, the addition of rFVIIa and platelets (30-100 x 10(3)/ micro l) to platelet-poor plasma produced marked corrections, producing TEGs similar to those of platelet-rich plasma. These results indicate that factors II and X are essential for the hemostatic effects of rFVIIa, and that factors V and VIII promote these effects. We believe that TEGs are, at present, one of the most useful tools for evaluating in vitro hemostatic effects of rFVIIa."
CD010438,0,22641771,0,The C-terminal fragment of axon guidance molecule Slit3 binds heparin and neutralizes heparin's anticoagulant activity.,"Slit3 is a large molecule with multiple domains and belongs to axon guidance families. To date, the biological functions of Slit3 are still largely unknown. Our recent study demonstrated that the N-terminal fragment of Slit3 is a novel angiogenic factor. In this study, we examined the biological function of the C-terminal fragment of human Slit3 (HSCF). The HSCF showed a high-affinity binding to heparin. The binding appeared to be heparin/heparan sulfate-specific and depends on the size, the degree of sulfation, the presence of N- and 6-O-sulfates and carboxyl moiety of the polysaccharide. Functional studies observed that HSCF inhibited antithrombin binding to heparin and neutralized the antifactor IIa and Xa activities of heparin and the antifactor IIa activity of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Thromboelastography analysis observed that HSCF reversed heparin's anticoagulation in global plasma coagulation. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that HSCF is a novel heparin-binding protein that potently neutralizes heparin's anticoagulation activity. This study reveals a potential for HSCF to be developed as a new antidote to treat overdosing of both heparin and LMWH in clinical applications."

Arterial blood samples were taken from 43 anesthetized piglets aged up to 6 weeks and weighing 4-6 kg. The following clotting measurements were recorded: clotting time, clot formation time (CFT), maximum clot firmness (MCF) and alpha angle using ROTEM delta assays ExTEM, InTEM, FibTEM and ApTEM. Intrarater variability was assessed when a single operator performed the same assay simultaneously in all four channels of the ROTEM device. Interrater variability was assessed by two different operators simultaneously performing the same assay. Variance components of the data were analyzed using linear mixed modeling. Three hundred and forty-three tests from 86 samples were loaded and analyzed. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was more than 0.7 for clotting measurements except for CFT and alpha in InTEM. For intrarater and interrater assessment, different relative variability for the ROTEM measurements were found with consistently higher variability for clotting time and CFT and lower variability of MCF and alpha angle. Interrater variability was not statistically significant as supported using Akaike's information criterion. Piglet coagulation testing using ROTEM delta showed a high ICC. Variability was significantly lower in MCF and angle alpha compared with clotting time and CFT. No further variability was added by a second user. Based on these data, ROTEM delta appears to be suitable as POCT."

Our objective was to design and test a redox-based method to detect carboxyhemefibrinogen. Normal, pooled, citrated plasma was exposed to 0-100  μmol/l carbon monoxide releasing molecule-2 (tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer; CORM-2) before or after exposure to the organic reductant phenylhydroxylamine (PHA, 0-30  mmol/l), a compound that rapidly converts Fe(+2) to Fe(+3) in heme. Addition of calcium and tissue factor activation in disposable thrombelastographic cups was performed, followed by data collection at 37°C for 15  min. Elastic modulus (G, dynes/cm(2)) was the primary endpoint. CORM-2 significantly increased G values by 67.8% compared to unexposed plasma; pretreatment with 10  mmol/l PHA significantly decreased G values in CORM-2-exposed plasma by 77.1%, whereas 30  mmol/l PHA was required to significantly decrease G values by 64.0% in plasma following CORM-2 pre-exposure. G values were not significantly different between unexposed plasma and plasma exposed to CORM-2 followed by 30  mmol/l PHA addition. Conversion of fibrinogen-bound to the metheme state alone decreased G by 34.3-38.9% following exposure to 10-30  mmol/l PHA. Conversion of fibrinogen-bound heme Fe(+2) to Fe(+3) with PHA abrogated carbon monoxide-mediated increases in clot strength. Clinical trials are planned to investigate smoking individuals to mechanistically link carboxyhemefibrinogen formation with in-vitro hypercoagulability."

Clinical exploration of patients included: physical inspection, pulses palpation, intermittent claudication (in metres), arteriography before surgery, and postoperative evolution of oscillometric and Doppler indexes. Determinations of platelet aggregation, induced by ADP, epinephrine and collagen, as well as of prothrombin time, platelet adhesiveness, and of thromboelastography parameters in PRP ane PPP were also carried out. Biochemical and hematological data were determined; gastric tolerance and other side effects were written down. Results show a clear improvement of all patients due to surgery, but with triflusal, it has been possible to maintain a prophylactic effect without thrombosis of the graft or of the distal vessel of patients, during the postoperative period. Actually, lower limbs temperature and pulses were maintained, with a good capillary content and with an improved walking distance. No changes in prothrombin time an platelet adhesiveness, have been observed. Five patients showed a clear hypoaggregant tendency, and thromboelastography in PRP indicates a statistically significant increase of R and K parameters as well as a decrease of am. It must be noticed the absence of gastric, hepatic, renal or metabolic side effects and no haemorrhagic lesions were observed. In conclusion, the treatment of these patients with triflusal prevents the otherwise frequent appearance of postoperative thrombosis in this kind of arterial surgery."

Thirty-six infants with cyanotic CCHD were involved and divided into two groups: In group H (n = 20), hematocrit (HCT) > 54%, and in group L (n = 16), HCT < 54%. Blood was sampled at anesthesia induction (T1), rewarming to 36 degrees C (T2), after heparin neutralization (T3), and 4 h after operation (T4). The hemostatic changes were evaluated by thromboelastograph (TEG). After surgery, group H was treated with fibrinogen-combined platelets (PLT), while group L was treated with PLT only. We observed the effect at T4. At T1, the hemostatic function in group H, deteriorating with the increase of HCT (P < 0.01), was obviously lower than that in group L (P < 0.01), but the PLT function was still complete. In group H, the hemostatic function at T2 decreased with a significant drop of PLT function (P < 0.01) and had little change of functional fibrinogen (Ffg) (P > 0.05). At T3, compared with T2, there were improvements in hemostatic function and Ffg (P < 0.01, respectively) without increase of PLT (P > 0.05) in group H. After therapy, PLT function in both groups restored to T1 level (P > 0.05); Ffg at T4 was significantly better than at T1 (P < 0.01) in group H, but Ffg at T4 with still normal function was lower than at T1 in group L (P < 0.01). Whole hemostatic function at T4 was back to normal and had no differences between two groups. So, we proposed that fibrinogen and PLT transfusion in combination should be better for infants with high HCT CCHD, but PLT alone might be enough for low HCT ones."

Deficiencies in platelets and coagulation factors in bleeding patients or patients at risk for bleeding can be achieved by transfusion of platelet concentrate or plasma products, respectively. Prohemostatic treatment may be beneficial in case of severe bleeding, whereas restoring physiological anticoagulant pathways may be helpful in patients with sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation."
CD010438,0,19549209,0,Endoscopic classification for reflux pharyngolaryngitis.,"The quality of life in patients who have undergone surgery for esophageal cancer is frequently disturbed by postoperative gastroesophageal reflux disease or pharyngolaryngeal reflux disease. Recently, there have been many reports on gastroesophageal reflux disease after esophagectomy, and only a few on pharyngolaryngeal reflux disease. There is not yet any convenient endoscopic classification of reflux pharyngolaryngitis. We designed a new classification for reflux pharyngolaryngitis based on endoscopic findings. Our new classification consists of the five grades from 0 to IV based on (i) the extent and severity of erythema and/or edema in the pharynx and the larynx, and (ii) the extent and severity of granulation or scarring stenosis in the vocal cords. Ninety-three patients after cervical esophagogastrostomy after esophagectomy (the CEG group) and 28 patients after intrathoracic esophagogastrostomy (the TEG group) were reviewed in this study. We investigated the relation between the severity of reflux pharyngolaryngitis and clinical symptoms in these patients, and the correlation between this new classification of reflux pharyngolaryngitis and the Los Angeles classification of reflux esophagitis. Reflux esophagitis was more severe in the TEG group than in the CEG group, while there was no difference in the grading of reflux pharyngolaryngitis between the two groups. The pharyngolaryngeal symptoms and F-scale scores were not correlated with the severity of reflux pharyngolaryngitis in each group. The grading of reflux pharyngolaryngitis and that of reflux esophagitis was correlated in each group (P<0.001 in the CEG group and P=0.002 in the TEG group). We proposed a new endoscopic classification of reflux pharyngolaryngitis. The new classification of reflux pharyngolaryngitis correlated fairly well with the Los Angeles classification of reflux esophagitis, although this classification did not correlate with the clinical symptoms in patients who underwent esophagectomy. Follow-up attention including upper endoscopy should be paid to reflux pharyngolaryngitis in patients after esophagogastrostomy as well as reflux esophagitis, because there is often a lack in symptoms regardless of high incidence of pharyngolaryngitis."
CD010438,0,1413659,0,"Bone marrow fractionation by the haemonetics system: reduction of red cell mass before marrow freezing, with special reference to pediatric marrow volumes.","For purposes of freezing autologous marrow or transplants of allogeneic marrow with major ABO blood group incompatibility, 54 freshly harvested bone marrows from children of 7-65 kg of weight were depleted of their red cells with the Haemonetics V50 system. The marrow volumes ranged from 230 to 1,145 ml, with 17 small (200-399 ml), 18 intermediate (400-799 ml) and 19 large (800-1,200 ml) volumes. After processing, the median recoveries were: volume 24%, red cell mass 18%, and nucleated cells 75%. In the small marrow volume group, a good nucleated cell recovery was achieved at the expense of red cell depletion. The colony-forming units, granulocytes-macrophages (CFU-GM) were normal after thawing of processed, cryopreserved marrows, and good engraftment of both allogeneic and autologous marrows were achieved. We conclude that marrow processing with the Haemonetics V50 system results in adequate red cell depletion and good nucleated cell recovery without open-air contact of marrow or excessive time consumption. For small marrow volumes, however, the red cell depletion was suboptimal, and a bowl size smaller than 125 ml is desirable for pediatric use."

CD010438,0,15122174,0,"A novel modification of the Thrombelastograph assay, isolating platelet function, correlates with optical platelet aggregation.","Flow cytometry, singlet platelet counting, and optical aggregation have been used to monitor clopidogrel and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) platelet antagonists. Optical aggregation is considered the gold standard, but neither it nor flow cytometry is convenient in larger-scale clinical studies or point-of-care systems. Singlet platelet counting, a point-of-care assay correlated with optical platelet aggregation, only provides a measurement of platelet function at a single point in time. The Thrombelastograph is used to assay whole blood for thrombin-generated maximal clot-shear elasticity, referred to as the maximal amplitude (MA). Although platelet dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and the in vitro effect of strong inhibitors such as IIb/IIIa antagonists can be observed, with thrombin generation milder platelet inhibitors cannot be assessed. We modified the Thromboelastograph assay, using reptilase and factor XIIIa, to form a clot, without thrombin generation, in heparinized whole blood. The resulting clot MA is dependent on added platelet agonists such as ADP or arachidonic acid, is sensitive to platelet antagonists, and provides a continuous measure of platelet function more analogous and better correlated with optical aggregation. This novel modification of the Thromboelastograph assay should prove to be a useful point-of-care whole-blood assay with which to monitor the effects of GPIIb/IIIa, ADP, and thromboxane A(2)-receptor-inhibiting drugs in patients."

CD010438,0,9651146,0,Species specificity of the anticoagulant activity of human urinary soluble thrombomodulin.,"The anticoagulant activities of human urinary soluble thrombomodulin (UTM) in blood taken from various species using several anticoagulant assay systems were compared; it was examined which coagulant assay system is appropriate for evaluation of the antithrombotic effects of UTM and how the species specificity of UTM is involved in the mechanisms of action of UTM. When anticoagulant activities were compared using activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thromboelastography (TEG), and thrombin generation test (TGT), the effect of UTM was found to be the strongest in humans among various species tested. Among the anticoagulant assays tested, TGT reflecting protein C (PC) activation by UTM, appeared to be more sensitive than APTT and TEG in detection of thrombomodulin activity. In the study of the mechanisms of action of UTM, UTM exhibited nearly the same antithrombin activity against human and rat thrombin; the rate of activation of human PC by thrombin/UTM complex was much higher than that of rat PC. Therefore, the species specificity of the anticoagulant activity of UTM may be attributable to thrombin/UTM-PC interaction, but not to UTM-thrombin interaction. From these results, we concluded that TGT reflecting PC activation by UTM will be a more useful assay than APTT and TEG for estimating the antithrombotic effects of UTM in humans. Furthermore, our findings suggest that UTM will exhibit more potent antithrombotic effects in humans than those in rats by strongly enhancing thrombin-catalyzed PC activation."

CD010438,0,2371016,0,Dual tracer technique to measure salvaged red cell survival following autotransfusion in aortic surgery.,The survival of autotransfused red cells was measured for two salvage devices used in 12 elective aortic reconstructions. Six patients underwent cell salvage with the Solco-trans device and six with the Haemonetics cell saver. A double tracer technique was used to take account of post-operative blood loss and fluid replacement. Comparison was made with the results of a group of normal volunteers. A comparison was made of the labelling efficiency of damaged and undamaged red cells using chromium to check that red cells damaged during autotransfusion can be labelled. No significant difference was seen. There was no significant difference in red cell survival between the volunteer group and either of the two salvage device groups. These results suggest that red cell survival is not compromised by the autotransfusion process using these two devices.

We thus sampled 60 ml of blood in 30 healthy volunteers. The blood was centrifuged for 30 min at 2000 g and separated into plasma, which contained the platelet fraction, and packed red blood cells. The blood was subsequently reconstituted by combining the entire plasma fraction with a mixture of packed red blood cells, 0.9% saline, so that the final haematocrit was either 40, 30, 20, or 10%. Blood coagulation was assessed by computerized Thrombelastograph analysis. Data were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance and post-hoc paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction. Decreasing the haematocrit from 40 to 10% resulted in a shortening of reaction time (r) and coagulation time (k), and an increase in angle alpha, maximum amplitude (MA) and clot strength (G) (all P<0.02). This pattern represents acceleration of blood coagulation with low haematocrit values. The isolated reduction in haematocrit, therefore, does not compromise in vitro blood coagulation."

In addition, blood quality was studied prospectively in group A (n = 5), B (n = 10) and C (n = 10) and each group compared to a control group. Results (mean values/patient) were: Blood salvage with A yielded 570 +/- 230 ml (hematocrit = 50%), B 509 +/- 156 ml (69%) and C 593 +/- 430 ml (26%). The required homologous blood products, i.e. packed cells (PC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) diminished significantly when combined autologous blood salvage was used (PC 6.0 +/- 3.4 vs 3.4 +/- 1.9, p less than 0.05; FFP 3.4 +/- 3.8 vs 2.6 +/- 3.0). Autologous erythrocyte function assessed by 2,3DPG was normal in all three methods (range 14.77-16.03 mumol/gHb).

Determination of prothrombin time and activated partial prothrombin time using the Hemochron device showed good correlation with laboratory coagulation assays (r = 0.912, p < 0.001, and r = 0.794, p < 0.001). Maximum clot firmness as determined by thrombelastometry correlated well with platelet count (r = 0.779, p < 0.001) and, to a lesser degree, with fibrinogen concentration (r = 0.590, p < 0.001).

CD010438,0,1722053,0,Microassays for androgen and progesterone receptor quantitation as compared with standard saturation analyses in human prostatic tissues.,"Simultaneous measurement of androgen and progesterone receptor content in cytosol and salt extractable nuclear subcompartments of benign hyperplastic prostatic tissue was carried out with various microassay techniques and compared to the results from analyses on bulky tissue from the same tissue specimens. The microassays were carried out as modified saturation analyses or as single concentration assays at various degrees of dilution with tris-EDTA-glycerol (TEG) buffer. Tissue samples for the standard assay weighed between 1.76 and 3.22 g, whereas the microassay samples weighted between 0.14 and 0.47 g. When considering the results of the standard assay as the ""true"" value, the microassays on the same tissue samples tended to underestimate both the androgen and progesterone receptor contents. Data from the microassays showed a wide variation of the androgen and progesterone receptor content in cytosol and nuclei. With the standard assay technique no detectable amount of progesterone receptor was found in the nuclei, whereas the microassays often indicated false-positive progesterone receptor content in this subcompartment. Therefore, the measurements of steroid receptors using biochemical microassays in prostatic tissue are unreliable and not suitable for clinical use, at least with the techniques available today. Reports in the literature based on such assays should therefore be interpreted with great caution."

An amphiphilic derivative of RGD that can be dissolved in an organic solvent has potential in the development of non-thrombogenic biomaterials. Such a derivative, LA-GRGD, was synthesised by coupling glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (GRGD) with lauric acid (LA). Its solubility and antithrombotic, cytotoxic and cell-binding effects were then evaluated in comparison with heparin (which is used clinically) and a fibronectin-engineered protein polymer (FEPP). Thromboelastography (TEG) was used to measure blood clotting time using fresh whole blood from healthy volunteers. Tissue factor (TF) activity was measured using plasma with a standard prothrombin time assay (PT). Cytotoxicity was assessed on human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) using an Alamar blue assay. Solubility of the conjugate was assessed in a co-solvent. These techniques were used to study LA-GRGD, using heparin and FEPP as controls. The amphiphilic property of LA-GRGD was dependent on the feed mole ratio of GRGD to LA. LA-GRGD was soluble in acetone:water and water. LA-GRGD inhibited TF by >90% and prolonged TEG-r by 8.2+/-3.3 min (200 microg ml(-1)). Heparin inhibited TF by >90%, but prolonged TEG-r by 97.4+/-1.6 min (1 U ml(-1)); FEPP inhibited TF by >90% (100 microg ml(-1)) and prolonged TEG-r by 73.7+/-8.4 min (10 microg ml(-1)). Heparin had no cytotoxic effect on EC metabolism and viability at the concentrations studied (0.1-100 U ml(-1)). No significant cytotoxic effect was produced by LA-GRGD or FEPP at concentrations ranging from 0.1 microg ml(-1) to 50 microg ml(-1), but, at higher concentrations (100 microg ml(-1) and 200 microg ml(-1)), a detrimental effect was observed. Cell binding studies showed that LA-GRGD bound 29% of ECs compared with FEPP (60%) and heparin (22%).

There is currently much interest in the possible use of fibrinolytic agents in human therapeutics. In this study, we report the presence of fibrinolytic activities in shark cartilage extract (SCE). In vitro, SCE at 100 microg/ml completely degraded fibrin gel in an aprotinin-insensitive manner, suggesting a non-plasmin molecular nature. SCE was able to cleave all chains of fibrinogen and fibrin and the cleavage was completely inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, suggesting an essential role for metalloprotease(s) in this process. Using fibrinogen zymography, we show that SCE contains two plasmin-independent fibrinolytic activities and that these activities are correlated with the presence of 58 and 62 kDa proteases in the extract. SCE-fibrinolytic activities are inhibited by dithiothreitol, suggesting that disulfide bonds are necessary for the protease structure. Finally, using thromboelastography, SCE markedly induced retraction of human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) clot, this process being completely abolished by 1,10-phenanthroline. These data suggest the presence of novel non-plasmin fibrinolytic activities within SCE. This extract may thus represent a potential source of new therapeutic molecules to prevent and treat vaso-occlusive and thromboembolic disorders."

However, haemodilution with saline seems to cause a hypercoagulable state both in vivo and in vitro. The aim of the present study was to measure the effect of mild to severe haemodilution using thrombelastography. Blood samples were taken in 12 healthy volunteers and divided into seven aliquots. One aliquot was undiluted and acted as control. The other six were diluted with normal saline, Ringer Acetate, 4% albumin, Dextran 70, 6% and 10% hydroxyethylstarch to 10%, 20%, 40%, 50% and 60% dilution. The dilution was checked by measuring the haemoglobin concentration. Each aliquot was placed in a temperature-controlled thrombelastography channel. Increased coagulation activity, as measured by thrombelastography changes, was detected at low and medium levels of dilution with all the tested solutions. At more than 40% dilution, coagulation returned to normal while in the case of dextran and hydroxyethylstarch coagulopathy developed. For crystalloids and albumin,dilution had to exceed 50% before coagulation was impaired.

CD010438,0,14980916,0,Peroxynitrite decreases rabbit tissue factor activity in vitro.,"Tissue factor (TF) is a primary initiator of physiological coagulation in vivo. Peroxynitrite (OONO(-)), a molecule formed from nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O(2). (-)), decreases human TF activity in vitro. Coagulopathy has been associated with hepatoenteric ischemia-reperfusion known to involve formation of OONO(-). Further, circulating TF activity decreases in rabbits after hepatoenteric ischemia-reperfusion. We hypothesized that exposure of rabbit TF to OONO(-) would result in a decrease in activity. OONO(-) generation was performed with 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), a molecule that produces both nitric oxide and superoxide. Rabbit brain TF was incubated at 37 degrees C for 90 min with 1) 0 mM SIN-1, 2) 5 mM SIN-1, 3) 5 mM SIN-1 and 2000 U/mL recombinant human superoxide dismutase (hSOD1), or 4) 2000 U/mL hSOD1 (n = 8 per condition). TF activity was assessed by addition of TF samples to human plasma and measuring clot formation kinetics with a thrombelastograph(R). TF exposure to SIN-1 resulted in a 48% decrease in activity that was significantly different from the other three conditions (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the other conditions. We conclude that rabbit TF is inhibited by OONO(-), and further investigation to determine the role of OONO(-) in coagulopathies associated with hepatoenteric ischemia-reperfusion is warranted."
CD010438,0,1285042,0,A controlled trial of intra-operative autologous transfusion in cardiothoracic surgery measuring effect on transfusion requirements and clinical outcome.,"We carried out a prospective, controlled trial of intra-operative autologous transfusion (IOAT) in cardiac surgery using the Haemonetics Cellsaver 4, to determine the effects on transfusion requirements and early clinical outcome. Intra-operative autologous transfusion in unselected patients resulted in a reduction in the use of red cells in patients undergoing first-time operations (IOAT median 3 units, controls median 4 units, P = 0.0023), with no difference in the use of other blood products. Post-operative haemoglobin was higher in IOAT patients (IOAT 11.6 g/dl +/- 1.1 versus controls 11.2 g/dl +/- 0.98, P < 0.001). There is therefore the potential for a further reduction in homologous blood use in the IOAT group. There was no difference in early clinical outcome in the two groups; in particular the incidence of coagulopathies was not influenced by IOAT. The routine use of IOAT would add substantially to the cost of these operations. The decision to use it must therefore be based on an assessment of the value of the reduction in risk to the patient achieved by a small reduction in homologous donor exposures."

CD010438,0,1545507,0,[Effects of induced hypotensive anesthesia on the blood coagulation-fibrinolysis system measured by thrombelastography--comparison between prostaglandin E1 and trimethaphan].,"The coagulation-fibrinolysis system has been studied in two groups of 16 patients classified ASA 1 undergoing radical mastectomy during controlled hypotensive anesthesia induced by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) or by trimethaphan (TMP) under enflurane anesthesia. Thrombelastography (TEG) was used to evaluate both coagulation and fibrinolysis systems, while simultaneously measuring platelet aggregation in response to ADP and collagen, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), serum concentrations of fibrinogen, and platelet counts. In the PGE1 group, APTT was significantly shortened (P less than 0.05) while the drug was being infused, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups, which was considered due to the effect of enflurane. Also, no statistically significant changes were noted in the other measured parameters. These results suggest that controlled hypotensive anesthesia using either PGE1 or TMP under enflurane anesthesia produces no significant changes in the blood coagulation-fibrinolysis system and that both are useful for the management of bleeding during surgery. Further, TEG was found to reflect other parameters properly. It is therefore useful for monitoring the blood coagulation-fibrinolysis system during anesthesia."
CD010438,0,18289228,0,Coagulation and biochemical effects of balanced salt-based high molecular weight vs saline-based low molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch solutions during the anhepatic period of liver transplantation.,"The anhepatic period of liver transplantation is generally marked by a decrease in preload, and the infusion of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solution is often an effective way to restore volume deficits in non-anaemic patients. However, the infusion of even limited amounts of HES solution during the anhepatic period may result in a worsening coagulopathy. Moreover, lactate-containing HES solution may cause some degree of biochemical derangements in compromised recipients. Therefore, we compared two different types of HES solutions: a balanced salt-based high molecular weight HES solution (670/0.75; high MW group) and a saline-based low molecular weight HES solution (130/0.4; low MW group) with respect to coagulation and biochemical profiles. First, in an in vitro study (n = 48), thromboelastography was performed to determine the effects of two HES solutions on coagulation after diluting (11%) the recipient's blood sample with each HES solution. Second, in an in vivo study, 500 ml of one of the two 6% HES solution was administered to 74 recipients (n = 37, each group) for 30 min after starting the anhepatic period. The coagulation profiles, including thromboelastography, and biochemical profiles were measured before and 30 min after the end of infusion. Less impairment in the thromboelastography profiles and aPTT was observed in the high MW group. A higher calcium concentration and less reduction in platelet count were noted in the high MW group, but lactate accumulation was greater. In conclusion, a balanced salt-based high molecular weight HES solution is a more effective volume replacement during the anhepatic period of liver transplantation with respect to coagulation than a saline-based low molecular weight HES solution, although lactate accumulation is a possible concern."
CD010438,0,19767408,0,Anticoagulation and coagulation management for ECMO.,Advances in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) management have helped to reduce complications compared with its inception but they remain high. The principal causes of mortality and morbidity are bleeding and thrombosis. The nonbiologic surface of an extracorporeal circuit provokes a massive inflammatory response leading to consumption and activation of procoagulant and anticoagulant components. The vast differences in neonatal and adult anticoagulation and transfusion requirements demands tremendous clinical knowledge to provide the best care. Increased use of thrombelastogram will complement other methods currently being used to improved care. Methods to recognize the level of thrombin formation at the bedside could help reduce neurologic complications. ECMO requires a multidisciplinary team approach to achieve the best outcomes.
CD010438,0,16637031,0,Ionic liquid-derived blood-compatible composite membranes for kidney dialysis.,"A novel heparin- and cellulose-based biocomposite is fabricated by exploiting the enhanced dissolution of polysaccharides in room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). This represents the first reported example of using a new class of solvents, RTILs, to fabricate blood-compatible biomaterials. Using this approach, it is possible to fabricate the biomaterials in any form, such as films or membranes, fibers (nanometer- or micron-sized), spheres (nanometer- or micron-sized), or any shape using templates. In this work, we have evaluated a membrane film of this composite. Surface morphological studies on this biocomposite film showed the uniformly distributed presence of heparin throughout the cellulose matrix. Activated partial thromboplastin time and thromboelastography demonstrate that this composite is superior to other existing heparinized biomaterials in preventing clot formation in human blood plasma and in human whole blood. Membranes made of these composites allow the passage of urea while retaining albumin, representing a promising blood-compatible biomaterial for renal dialysis, with a possibility of eliminating the systemic administration of heparin to the patients undergoing renal dialysis."

CD010438,0,21441889,0,Blood transfusion in trauma patients: unresolved questions.,"Massive transfusion is an essential part of resuscitation efforts in acute trauma patients. The goal is to quickly correct trauma-induced coagulopathy and replace red blood cell (RBC) mass with the minimal number as well as the appropriate choice of blood components to minimize the possible adverse effects of transfusions. Early trauma induced coagulopathy (ETIC) is present in about 20% of patients upon hospital admission and predicts for decreased survival. The mechanism of ETIC is still being elucidated; however, most theories of ETIC's pathophysiology justify the early use of plasma. Most massive transfusion protocol (MTP) ratios deliver blood products in a ratio of 1:1:1 for RBCs:plasma:platelets, which is supported by the majority of the literature demonstrating improved patient survival with higher ratios (>1 plasma and platelet for every 2 RBCs transfused). Indeed, formula-driven MTPs allow trauma services to react quickly to ETIC and provide coagulation factors and platelets in these ratios without having to wait for the results of coagulation assays while the patient's coagulopathy worsens. New MTPs are being created which are adjusted according to an individual's coagulation laboratory values based on point-of-care laboratory tests, such as thromboelastography. When creating an MTP, product wastage due to inappropriate activation and improper product storage should be considered and closely monitored. Another area of discussion regarding transfusion in trauma includes the potential association of prolonged storage of RBCs and adverse outcomes, which has yet to be confirmed. Significant progress has been made in the transfusion management of trauma patients, but further studies are required to optimize patient care and outcomes."

We have used two different kinds of stent grafts covered with woven Dacron grafts, a Gianturco Z-stent graft (G-SG) and a Spiral Z-stent graft (S-SG). Because the G-SG lacks adequate flexibility, the end of the graft may injure the intima after long-term deployment in the proximal descending aorta. We have used S-SGs, which are more flexible than G-SG, to improve outcome. We report our late midterm results and discuss treatment policy."

Two large doses of recombinant factor VIIa (200 microg/kg followed by 300 microg/kg) were required for hemostasis. Traditional and rotational thrombelastography were used to guide dose and timing of rFVIIa therapy.

CD010438,0,18510529,0,New approaches in the measurement of coagulation.,"In this session contributors present recent developments in laboratory tools for investigation of haemorrhagic disorders as well as their relative utility in clinical research. In an overview of B. Sørensen the present knowledge is summarized on the dynamic properties of whole blood fibrin formation as studied by changes in whole blood elasticity on a thrombelastometry system. Additionally, fibrin formation dynamics using simple APTT methods are presented. G. Castaman reviews the pathophysiology of von Willebrand's disease (VWD) and explains which tests are best used in diagnosis and subclassification of VWD accounting for recent developments. This presentation also describes the treatment technologies available today and their implications in clinical management of bleeding episodes in VWD. J. Lloyd addresses the assay discrepancy phenomenon that is found in some of our patients suffering from mild haemophilia A. Assay discrepancy most often means a much lower factor VIII:C value by a two-stage or chromogenic assay for factor VIII:C compared to the activity recorded by the one-stage clotting system for factor VIII:C. In rare cases, the opposite phenomenon exist. The presentation includes data from 16 Australian families with discrepant results. D. Varon reports on an assay for study of platelet function in whole blood under flow conditions. The equipment is described as a cone-and-plate(let) analyser in which the adhesion and aggregation of platelets onto a polystyrene surface is studied under arterial flow conditions. Basically, it is anticipated that proteins such as VWF and fibrinogen of flowing blood is attached to the polystyrene surface where they build up a thrombogenic surface. In the study of the author platelets were pre-activated with agonists and platelet deposits were determined after passage of whole blood for a pre-set time interval. Data presented suggest that the assay is sensitive to platelet numbers as well as qualitative changes in platelets themselves, and several examples of disorders characterized by enhanced as well as reduced platelet aggregating activities illustrates the sensitivity of the method."
CD010438,0,11049889,0,Thromboelastography as a perioperative measure of anticoagulation resulting from low molecular weight heparin: a comparison with anti-Xa concentrations.,"Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is commonly used to prevent postoperative thromboembolism. Currently, there is no convenient test to measure the degree of anticoagulation from LMWH. This prospective study examines the relationship of thromboelastography and serum anti-Xa concentration in patients treated with enoxaparin. Twenty-four adult patients scheduled for orthopedic surgery using epidural anesthesia were enrolled. Epidural catheters were removed the morning after surgery before the commencement of subcutaneous enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily. Venous blood samples were obtained at 1) the induction of anesthesia (baseline), 2) immediately before the third dose of enoxaparin postoperatively (Day 2-trough), 3) 4 h after the third dose postoperatively (Day 2-peak), and 4) immediately before the fifth dose postoperatively (Day 3-trough). Whole blood samples were obtained for thromboelastography, activated clotting time, and anti-Xa level analyses at each of the four time intervals. At the four sample intervals, the r time (mean +/- SEM). (20 +/- 1, 25 +/- 2, 51 +/- 6, 31 +/- 3 mm) and the k time (9 +/- 0. 7, 12 +/- 1, 27 +/- 5, 14 +/- 2 mm) of the thromboelastograph were significantly correlated with the expected peak and trough levels of LMWH and serum anti-Xa levels (P: < 0.05). At the Day 3-trough, thromboelastograph r times exceeded the normal range in 6 of 25 patients (25%). Prolongation of r time and k time on postoperative Day 3 may indicate an exaggerated response to LMWH. Thromboelastography is a test that could potentially correlate with the degree of anticoagulation produced by low molecular weight heparin."
CD010438,0,18510527,0,New assays for monitoring haemophilia treatment.,"Precise measurements of factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) activity are believed to be essential for clinical management in haemophilia, although discrepancies between factor levels and clinical severity have been recognized. Clot wave form analysis has demonstrated that different wave form patterns may be evident in severe haemophilia A patients with levels of FVIII activity <1 IU dL(-1), and this might explain, in part, the phenotypic heterogeneity seen in these patients. In addition, the relatively new technique of computer-assisted thrombelastography (TEG), in which coagulation is initiated by tissue factor, has revealed a considerable degree of variability in different patients in the presence FVIII levels, which are sufficient to normalize TEG parameters. In contrast, a global thrombin generation test (TGT) has been proposed as a sensitive and reliable method for assessing overall clotting function in haemophilia patients. Several studies have demonstrated a significant correlation between TGT and FVIII/FIX levels, and these measurements also appear to correlate with the clinical phenotype. The TGT may be very useful, therefore, for evaluating overall haemostasis in different clinical situations, although substantial inter-assay and inter-individual variations have been reported. Both the TEG and TGT have been found to be particularly helpful for monitoring haemostatic therapy with bypassing agents or conventional FVIII or FIX concentrates in patients with inhibitors. These global tests enable the selection of appropriate therapeutic agents in individual circumstances and offer the opportunity to tailor the most effective haemostatic treatment even during severe bleeding or major surgery."

CD010438,0,10094951,0,Infection and hemostasis in decompensated cirrhosis: a prospective study using thrombelastography.,"Bacterial infections are common complications in decompensated cirrhosis, but their relationship with hemostasis has not been studied. We prospectively assessed whether infection affects hemostasis in cirrhosis using routine hemostasis tests and thrombelastography (TEG), a global test of hemostatic function. Eighty-four cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh B: 26; C: 58) without overt bleeding or blood-product transfusion were prospectively evaluated with routine hemostasis tests and TEG on admission and/or the first day with signs of infection and 5 days later. There were 30 patients with infection; 15 had infection on admission, and 15 developed infection in hospital. In the patients who developed infection in hospital, there was a significant deterioration in all routine hemostasis tests except platelet count (PLT) and in all TEG parameters, on the first day of infection compared with 7 +/- 3 days previously. The same parameters significantly improved from the first day of infection to day 5 and after (P <.02) only in the 22 patients whose infection resolved, while the r, k, and alpha TEG parameters significantly worsened in the 8 patients with persistent infection. In those who developed infection in hospital and were cured (n = 11), the 5-day parameters did not differ from their preinfection values. In conclusion, bacterial infections frequently impair hemostasis in decompensated cirrhotic patients. Successful treatment of infection usually restores hemostasis parameters to preinfection levels in 5 days. Thus, infection may have a role in the bleeding diathesis of cirrhosis."

CD010438,0,7135350,0,On the interaction of heparin-containing polymers with plasma proteins and blood.,"In vitro exper iments showed that polymeric hydrogels containing covalently immobilized heparin affect the parameters of blood clotting system. This is not accounted for by the elution of heparin into the surrounding medium and this property of heparin-containing polymers is caused by specific interaction of immobilized heparin with plasma proteins. By the methods of coagulograms and thromboelastography it was revealed that the decrease of total blood anticoagulant activity takes place due to the decrease in blood of fibrinogen, prothrombin and thrombin content and the suppression of fibrin stabilizing factor activity. Free heparin content in blood was left unaffected. It was found that plasma proteins permeate the hydrophilic polymer matrix and interact with immobilized heparin. Binding strength for immobilized heparin is decreased in the array fibrinogen congruent to thrombin much greater than plasmin greater than serum albumin. Complexes of immobilized heparin with fibrinogen, thrombin and plasmin display lytic action towards unstabilized fibrin."

CD010438,0,2240696,0,[Technical constraints in rapid vascular fluid replacement].,"Rapid fluid infusion remains the cornerstone for therapy of hypovolaemic shock. The principal limitations of flow rate are governed by the four variables of Poiseuille's law: tube internal diameter and length, viscosity of the fluid passing through the tube, and the pressure gradient between the two ends of the tube. Conventional transfusion systems, with wide bore tubing (up to 5.0 mm internal diameter), large bore cannulas (8.5 French introducer catheters), high pressure (up to 300 mmHg) and diluted blood, can result in a maximum flow rate of about 1,000 ml.min-1 (for crystalloid solutions). Specific apparatus for rapid infusion can increase this to 1,500 ml.min-1 (Rapid Infusion System, Haemonetics).

However, platelet function may be accentuated during the stress of general anesthesia (GA) and surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate platelet function changes during a standard GA technique and surgery, as well as after a single intraoperative dose of intravenous (i.v.) KT. The study comprised 30 ASA physical status I patients undergoing GA for knee arthroscopy. Subjects were randomized to receive either KT 60 mg IV 15 min after skin incision or placebo i.v. Platelet function testing consisted of an Ivy bleeding time (BT), platelet aggregometry (PA) with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen, thromboelastography (TEG), and serum thromboxane B2 assays (TxB2). Platelet function testing was performed: 1) 15 min prior to the induction of GA, 2) 10 min after skin incision, and 3) 45 min after administration of study drug. BT decreased significantly in the placebo group from 263 +/- 133 s (mean +/- SD) preoperatively to 207 +/- 89 s postincision. BT did not change in the KT group. PA was unchanged after IV KT. TEG data was unchanged in both groups during anesthesia and surgery. TxB2 levels decreased markedly in the KT group from 106.9 +/- 96.2 ng/mL preoperatively to 0.4 +/- 1.2 ng/mL poststudy drug, P = 0.002. Platelet function appears to be accentuated during GA and surgery as evaluated by BT in the placebo group. Further, platelet function by BT, PA, and TEG was not inhibited after i.v.

The rate of activation of N8 by thrombin as well as Km and kcat for FX activation was in the same range as those observed for Advate®. The rate of activated protein C (APC)-catalysed inactivation was similar for activated N8 and Advate®. N8 improved thrombin generation in a dose-dependent manner and induced similar rates of thrombin generation as Advate® and the plasma-derived FVIII product Haemate®. Using thromboelastography (TEG®), N8 was shown to improve the clot formation and clot stability in whole blood from haemophilia A patients. Comparable potency and efficacy of N8 and Advate® was found based on TEG® parameters. Finally, similar binding profiles to immobilized lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) of N8 and Advate® were observed. The study demonstrated that N8 is fully functional in a variety of assays measuring FVIII activity. No functional differences were found between N8 and comparator compounds."

CD010438,0,9640150,0,Surgical/tourniquet pain accelerates blood coagulability but not fibrinolysis.,"Tissue damage during surgery induces coagulation factors and activates platelets. Surgical pain may provoke release of catecholamines, leading to hypercoagulability. We have investigated the effect of surgical pain on blood coagulability and fibrinolysis in orthopaedic operations using tourniquets in 22 patients undergoing total knee replacement. Patients were allocated to one of two groups to receive extradural anaesthesia (EA; n = 11) or general anaesthesia (GA; n = 11). The EA group received lumbar extradural block with lidocaine. The GA group received only general anaesthesia, maintained with 1.5-2.5% sevoflurane and 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Using a thrombelastogram technique, blood coagulability and fibrinolysis were measured. Mean maximum amplitude (MA), which reflects coagulability, increased after tourniquet inflation (11%) in group GA whereas MA in group EA did not change. After tourniquet deflation, MA values in both GA and EA groups increased significantly (10% and 20%, respectively) (P < 0.05), and there was also a significant difference in MA between groups (P < 0.05). The fibrinolytic rate did not change in either group during tourniquet inflation, but increased significantly (160%) after tourniquet deflation. There was no significant difference in fibrinolytic rate between the groups. We conclude that the hypercoagulability seen in group GA could have been caused by surgical or tourniquet pain, or both, and that extradural anaesthesia is a useful technique to prevent hypercoagulability."
CD010438,0,15105207,0,Peroxynitrite inactivates tissue plasminogen activator.,"Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has a prominent role in physiological fibrinolysis in vivo. Thrombosis has been associated with clinical scenarios (e.g., atherosclerotic disease) known to involve local decreases in tPA activity with concomitant formation of reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite (OONO(-)), a molecule formed from nitric oxide and superoxide. We hypothesized that exposure of tPA to OONO(-) would result in a decrease in tPA activity. OONO(-) was generated with 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), a molecule that produces both nitric oxide and superoxide. Recombinant tPA was incubated at 37 degrees C for 60 min with 0 microM SIN-1; 100 microM SIN-1; 100 microM SIN-1 and 4000 U/mL recombinant human superoxide dismutase; or 4000 U/mL recombinant human superoxide dismutase (n = 8 separate reactions per condition). Changes in tPA activity were assessed by addition of tPA samples to tissue factor-exposed human plasma and measuring clot fibrinolysis with a thrombelastograph. Exposure to SIN-1 resulted in a decrease in tPA-mediated fibrinolysis (<1% activity of tPA not exposed to SIN-1) that was significantly (P < 0.001) different from the other three conditions. There were no significant differences between the other conditions. We conclude that tPA is inhibited by OONO(-), and that OONO(-) may have a role in clinical thrombotic scenarios."
CD010438,0,7085748,0,Prophylaxis of early post-operative deep venous thrombosis by monitored heparin infusion.,"Increases in whole blood coagulability in patients undergoing abdominal surgery have been measured with the thrombelastograph. A continuous, low dose intravenous infusion of heparin has been administered in the operative period in an attempt to control these coagulability increases without increasing the risk of haemorrhage. A preliminary sub-cutaneous dose of heparin followed by a continuous infusion throughout the operation and for two hours afterwards effectively prevented the expected coagulability increase and resulted in reduction of early deep venous thrombosis incidence from 9/20 in controls to 1/19 in treated patients (p less than 0.05). The infusion has also been used in conjunction with a pre-operative test to predict the risk of deep venous thrombosis. Of 20 patients examined, 11 were designated as high risk and received an intra-operative heparin infusion and 9 predicted low risk patients received no specific prophylaxis. No venous thrombosis occurred in any patient within 48 hours of surgery."

CD010438,0,22910089,0,Coagulation management in patients undergoing mechanical circulatory support.,"The incidence of bleeding and thrombo-embolic complications in patients undergoing mechanical circulatory support therapy remains high and is associated with bad outcomes and increased costs. The need for anticoagulation and anti-platelet therapy varies widely between different pulsatile and non-pulsatile ventricular-assist devices (VADs) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) systems. Therefore, a unique anticoagulation protocol cannot be recommended. Notably, most thrombo-embolic complications occur despite values of conventional coagulation tests being within the targeted range. This is due to the fact that conventional coagulation tests such as international normalised ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and platelet count cannot detect hyper- or hypofibrinolysis, hypercoagulability due to tissue factor expression on circulating cells or increased clot firmness, and platelet aggregation as well as response to anti-platelet drugs. By contrast, point-of-care (POC) whole blood viscoelastic tests (thromboelastometry/-graphy) and platelet function tests (impedance or turbidimetric aggregometry) reflect in detail the haemostatic status of patients undergoing mechanical circulatory support therapy and the efficacy of their anticoagulation and antiaggregation therapy. Therefore, monitoring of haemostasis using POC thromboelastometry/-graphy and platelet function analysis is recommended during mechanical circulatory support therapy to reduce the risk of bleeding and thrombo-embolic complications. Notably, these haemostatic tests should be performed repeatedly during mechanical circulatory support therapy since thrombin generation, clot firmness and platelet response may change significantly over time with a high inter- and intra-individual variability. Furthermore, coagulation management can be hampered in non-pulsatile VADs by acquired von Willebrand syndrome, and in general by acquired factor XIII deficiency as well as by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. In addition, POC testing can be used in bleeding patients to guide calculated goal-directed therapy with allogeneic blood products, haemostatic drugs and coagulation factor concentrates to optimise the haemostasis and to minimise transfusion requirements, transfusion-associated adverse events and to avoid thrombo-embolic complications, as well. However, coagulation management in patients undergoing mechanical circulatory support therapy is somehow like navigating between Scylla and Charybdis, and development of protocols based on POC testing seems to be beneficial."
CD010438,0,53922,0,Use of hydroxyethyl starch to improve granulocyte collection in the Latham blood processor.,"This report describes a practical, relatively inexpensive system of leukapheresis and plateletpheresis, utilizing the Haemonetics blood processor. The results of 236 phereses of normal donors are reported, with particular attention to an evaluation of five different anticoagulant mixtures: ACD, 2 per cent citrate in saline, and three different combinations of citrate and hydroxyethyl starch (HES). These mixtures were compared with respect to their effectiveness in the harvesting of granylocytes and platelets, respectively. The best harvest of granulocytes (3.5 X 10(9) cells per liter of blood processed) was with 6 per cent HES anticoagulated with trisodium citrate. All solutions gave about the same platelet yields (a mean of 1.6 X 10(11) per liter of blood processed). Because of its higher citrate content, ACD caused three times as many donor reactions as the other solutions. The use of HES thus permits this widely available plateletpheresis system to be used for leukapheresis with only minimal procedural modification."

CD010438,0,22348384,0,Combined treatment with APCC (FEIBA®) and tranexamic acid in patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors and in patients with acquired haemophilia A--a two-centre experience.,"The management of bleeding in haemophilia patients with inhibitors can be challenging when using monotherapy with either activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant activated FVII (rFVIIa) fail. The antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid (TXA) increases clot stability and is used concomitantly with coagulation factor replacement to improve haemostasis in haemophilia patients without inhibitors in many countries in Europe. Combined treatment with TXA and rFVIIa is not contraindicated in haemophilia patients with inhibitors. However, the combined approach of TXA and APCC has not been investigated due to safety concerns of increased risk of thrombosis or disseminated intravasal coagulation (DIC). The aim of this study is to report our experience of concomitant use of APCC and TXA in haemophilia A patients with inhibitor and in patients with acquired haemophilia A with respect to safety and efficacy. Seven (n = 6) haemophilia A patients with inhibitors and one (n = 1) with acquired haemophilia A from Oslo (Norway) and Stockholm (Sweden) were included in the study. The APCC was given at doses consistent to the manufacturers' recommendation. TXA was administered concomitantly either 10 mg kg(-1) every 6-8 h intravenously or 20 mg kg(-1) every 6-8 h orally. Haemostatic response was assessed by thromboelastography (TEG) and thrombin generation assay (TGA) in three of the patients. A total number of three bleeding episodes and two minor and six major surgical procedures were performed under the coverage with APCC and TXA. Haemostatic outcome was rated excellent or good in 10 of 11 (91%) treatment episodes. One episode was rated with poor effect. No episodes of arterial, venous thrombosis or DIC occurred during or after the treatment. Data from TEG and TGA analysis showed no signs of hypercoagulability following the combined treatment. This report demonstrates that, in a limited number of patients, combined treatment with APCC and TXA seemed to be safe, tolerated and relatively effective in management of bleeding episodes and in preventing haemorrhage during surgery in haemophilia patients with inhibitors and in a patient with acquired haemophilia A. Further studies should be performed to confirm these data."

The concentrations of platelets as well as fibronectin in autologous fibrin glues were significantly higher than those in commercial ones (P < 0.001). Mechanical values (maximum amplitude and clot strength) obtained from thrombelastograph assays in two groups were not significantly different (P > 0.05). A dense platelet surface and fibrin net structures could be observed in the autologous samples, whereas there were only sparse fibrin nets without cellular components in Bioseal.

Our in vitro data indicate that while the mononuclear cell (MNC) concentration of the HV50 product was significantly greater than that of the 2991, the overall MNC recovery of the two products was equivalent. In addition, although the concentration of CFU-GM and BFU-E in the products was equivalent, recovery of these progenitors in the 2991 product was significantly greater than those of the HV50 product. There was no significant difference in either the final product concentration or the overall recovery of cells bearing the primitive myeloid antigens, CD33 or CD34, between the two methods. The HV50 product volume, the red cell and the granulocyte mass were significantly lower than those of the 2991. We conclude that the advantages gained through the use of each machine should be evaluated within the context of the specific intention for the graft. Future advances in the identification and understanding of the primitive stem cell will aid in attempts to evaluate the methods used to isolate these cells."

CD010438,0,22524128,0,"Clinical and epidemiological profiles of severe malaria in children from Delhi, India.","Plasmodium vivax is traditionally known to cause benign tertian malaria, although recent reports suggest that P. vivax can also cause severe life-threatening disease analogous to severe infection due to P. falciparum. There are limited published data on the clinical and epidemiological profiles of children suffering from 'severe malaria' in an urban setting of India. To assess the clinical and epidemiological profiles of children with severe malaria, a prospective study was carried out during June 2008-December 2008 in the Department of Pediatrics, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, a tertiary hospital located in East Delhi, India. Data on children aged < or = 12 years, diagnosed with severe malaria, were analyzed for their demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters. All patients were categorized and treated as per the guidelines of the World Health Organization. In total, 1,680 children were screened for malaria at the paediatric outpatient and casualty facilities of the hospital. Thirty-eight children tested positive for malaria on peripheral smear examination (2.26% slide positivity rate). Of these, 27 (71%) were admitted and categorized as severe malaria as per the definition of the WHO while another 11 (29%) received treatment on outpatient basis. Most (24/27; 88.8%) cases of severe malaria (n=27) were infected with P. vivax. Among the cases of severe malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax (n=24), 12 (50%) presented with altered sensorium (cerebral malaria), seven (29.1%) had severe anaemia (haemoglobin <5 g/dL), and 17 (70.8%) had thrombocytopaenia, of which two had spontaneous bleeding (epistaxis). Cases of severe vivax malaria are clinically indistinguishable from severe falciparum malaria. Our study demonstrated that majority (88.8%) of severe malaria cases in children from Delhi and adjoining districts of Uttar Pradesh were due to P. vivax-associated infection. P. vivax should, thus, be regarded as an important causative agent for severe malaria in children."
CD010438,0,18492116,0,Thromboelastography in children with coagulation factor deficiencies.,"Hemophilia is traditionally classified according to the levels of the deficient coagulation factor as Severe (<1%), Moderate (1-5%) or Mild (>5%). However, it is well known that the factor activity does not necessarily correspond to the clinical bleeding manifestations. As prophylactic therapy is the best method of prevention of serious complications such as hemophilic arthropathy, a test that may predict the bleeding pattern would be extremely beneficial. Thromboelastography (TEG) uses whole blood to determine clot formation characteristics, such as initiation, propagation as well as strength of the clot, and is now being extensively studied in bleeding and thrombophilia. This study attempted to determine the TEG characteristics in 47 children with moderate hemophilia (MH) and severe hemophilia with (SHI) and without inhibitors (SH) and tried to retrospectively correlate them to the clinical bleeding patterns. TEG showed evidence of faster and better clot formation, as evidenced by a higher maximum thrombin/fibrin generation, in those with mild bleeding manifestations compared to those with severe bleeding tendency, in addition to the expected prolongation in time to formation of clot related to factor deficiency. This may be a potentially useful tool to evaluate the bleeding tendency and determine need for prophylaxis in children with hemophilia."

CD010438,0,12351295,0,In vitro fertilization-induced alterations in coagulation and fibrinolysis as measured by thromboelastography.,"Supraphysiologic increases in estrogen produced by in vitro fertilization (IVF) promote the expression of hemostatic markers. Although quantitative studies of individual markers have been performed during IVF, their results are conflicting and do not reveal the qualitative effect of each marker on the overall coagulation and fibrinolytic processes. Thrombelastograph (TEG) coagulation analysis, by contrast, provides a global measure of coagulation and fibrinolysis and can indicate the relative contributions of clotting factors, fibrinogen, and platelets to each process. We studied the serum estrogen concentrations and TEG variables in 24 women at the beginning and conclusion of an IVF stimulation cycle. Serum estradiol (E(2)) concentrations (mean +/- SD) increased from 26.9 +/- 8.6 to 2098 +/- 913 pg/mL (P < 0.005) at baseline and oocyte retrieval, respectively. The measured TEG indices demonstrated alterations in coagulation rather than fibrinolysis. Although significant changes were noted in both the clot formation time and the coagulation index (P < 0.005), all TEG values remained within the normal range. In addition, an increased role of fibrinogen in promoting clot strength was observed. These findings may assist in the treatment of IVF patients who ultimately develop thromboembolic complications as a result of ovarian hyperstimulation. IMPLICATIONS. The dramatic changes in estrogen produced by in vitro fertilization therapies result in hemostatic marker alterations. Thrombelastograph coagulation analysis, which provides a global assessment of these changes, demonstrated significant alterations in two coagulation indices (clot formation time, coagulation index), although all variables remained within normal limits. The relative importance of fibrinogen versus platelets in determining clot strength was observed. No significant alterations in fibrinolysis were detected."

Actual C3 conversion during apheresis was illustrated by the finding of significantly elevated C3d levels (p less than 0.05) and of significantly increased alpha-1-antitrypsin/C3 ratios (p less than 0.05) in postapheresis serums. Similarly, marked granulocyte aggregating activity was found in these serums, indicative of the generation of significant amounts of the C-derived anaphylatoxin, C5a or C5a desarginine. A mean decrease of 59.75 percent in neutrophil count during the four procedures suggested sequestration of aggregated granulocytes in the pulmonary vasculature. Moreover, granulocytes activated by apheresis serums induced significant 51Cr leak from cultured human endothelial cells is vitro (p less than 0.001). We conclude that inflammatory C components produced during apheresis procedures may provoke granulocyte aggregation and embolization, leading to plugging of the pulmonary vasculature, and that apheresis-activated granulocytes may induce endothelial cytotoxicity, leading to the capillary leakage syndrome, characteristic of ARDS. Individual variability in C5a generation capacity or alterations in normal C5a clearing mechanisms may account for the low incidence of clinical C activation and true ARDS during apheresis. In these instances, high-dose steroids, which interfere with granulocyte-C interactions, may be beneficial."
CD010438,0,15095839,0,The rheological effects of X-Coating with albumin and hetastarch on blood during cardiopulmonary bypass.,"Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) exposes blood to artificial surfaces, resulting in mechanical damage to the formed elements of the blood. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of poly(2-methoxyethylacrylate) coating (PMEA, X-Coating) on coagulation and inflammation under various prime conditions. An in vitro analysis was conducted utilizing fresh whole human blood (2 units) and a CPB circuit (n = 18) consisting of a venous reservoir, oxygenator, and arterial filter. Nine nontreated circuits were used in a control group (CTR) and an equal number of tip-to-tip PMEA circuits for treatment (TRT). Each group was divided into three subgroups based upon prime: crystalloid, hetastarch (6%), and albumin (5%). CPB was conducted with a hematocrit 30% +/- 2, temperature 37 degrees C +/- 1, and a flow of 4 L/min. Samples were collected at 0, 60, 120, and 240 minute intervals. Endpoint measurements included thromboelastograph index (TI), and markers of inflammation and coagulation. The TI was significantly depressed in both groups when hetastarch was used in the prime. The TRT had significantly higher TI levels in both the crystalloid (0.3 +/- 0.1 vs. -3.3 +/- -1.2, P < .05) and albumin (0.6 +/- 0.2 vs -3.9 +/- -1.1. P < .03) subgroups compared to CTR groups. Platelet count was significantly higher in TRT as compared to CTR groups, except for both hetastarch groups. SEM demonstrated significant fibrin deposition on nontreated circuitry but little to no detection in the TRT group. In conclusion, both surface coating and prime components significantly effect coagulation, with PMEA circuits resulting in more favorable preservation of function."

CD010438,0,15605298,0,[Monitoring of Perioperative Dilutional Coagulopathy Using the ROTEM Analyzer: Basic Principles and Clinical Examples].,"Recent changes in quality of transfusion supply, transfusion triggers as well as fluid therapy promote the development of dilutional coagulopathy. Nevertheless, up to now guidelines generally assume presence of hypocoagulability when more than one individual circulating blood volume is lost. This might be true for some patients under some conditions but is not necessarily true for every patient. Routine coagulation tests are insufficient in predicting increased bleeding and, moreover, available after an unacceptable time delay. Therefore the occurrence of diffuse microvascular bleeding is often used as clinical sign to start hemostatic therapy. However, such severe derangement of hemostasis might lead to the development of secondary tissue damage and frequently is unresponsive to conventional treatment. Coagulopathy occurring during extensive surgery or after polytrauma can be detected and treated early when using the ROTEM monitoring. Recent data showing a direct beneficial effect of hemostatic therapy on blood loss and final outcome are scarce. However, evidence exists that the amount of blood loss, presence of coagulopathy and number of transfusions needed are associated with poor outcome in bleeding patients. Although manifold articles have been published already using thrombelastography for various indications (medline research ""thrombelastography"", 2022 articles), further data are needed to confirm the clinical experience that this technique is an excellent tool for safe patient management."
CD010438,0,15605299,0,"[Dilutional coagulopathy, an underestimated problem?].","When no fresh frozen plasma is available, acute major blood loss is compensated above all with crystalloids, colloids and erythrocyte concentrates, meaning that all plasma clotting factors are diluted. Consumption coagulopathy is almost always accompanied by dilutional coagulopathy. Formulas for calculating critical blood loss and standard coagulation tests are often not helpful in the case of massive transfusion. On the other hand, systems suitable for point of care, such as thrombelastography, have important advantages. In the case of consumption and dilutional coagulopathy plasma coagulation is disturbed and critical values are first seen for fibrinogen. Not only is fibrin polymerization impaired by the bleeding-induced loss and dilution of fibrinogen, but also by interaction with artificial colloids, particularly hydroxyethyl starch preparations. Therapy of consumption and dilutional coagulopathy calls for fresh frozen plasma. If this is not available in sufficient quantity or within a reasonable time, coagulation factor concentrates must be used. Neither fresh frozen plasma therapy nor treatment with coagulation factor concentrates has been the subject of detailed clinical study. Further studies are needed to work out guidelines for coagulation management in the case of massive blood loss."

CD010438,0,20729723,0,Use of fibrin-based thromboelastometry for cryoprecipitate transfusion in cardiac surgery involving deep hypothermic circulatory arrest during cardiopulmonary bypass.,"We aimed to assess the predictive value of fibrin-based thromboelastometry performed before weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for cryoprecipitate administered to correct the bleeding diathesis after CPB involving deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Eleven patients undergoing aortic surgery were enrolled. The arterial blood was withdrawn before skin incision, 30 min before CPB weaning (Cweaning), 5 min after protamine reversal (Preversal) and at closure of the sternum to run intrinsically activated INTEM, heparinase-treated HEPTEM, extrinsically activated EXTEM and platelet-inhibited FIBTEM analysis, platelet count, fibrinogen, prothrombin time (international normalized ratio) and activated partial thromboplastin time. The predicted value of FIBTEM A10 obtained during CPB for cryoprecipitate transfusion at Preversal was calculated. The cut-off points for FIBTEM A10 to reflect fibrinogen of 200 mg/dl at Preversal were 5 mm (P = 0.15). FIBTEM A10 at Preversal and Cweaning showed correlations as follows: FIBTEM A10 at Preversal = 0.02 + 1.42 × FIBTEM A10 at Cweaning (r² = 0.80). The cut-off value for FIBTEM A10 at Cweaning to determine whether to prepare cryoprecipitate in advance during CPB was calculated to be 3 mm, and the positive and negative predictability for FIBTEM A10 of 3 or less versus more than 3 at Cweaning for the necessity of cryoprecipitate transfusion at Preversal (A10 ≤ 5 versus > 5) were 100 and 80%, respectively. This study showed that fibrinogen reflected in FIBTEM during pump can be used to estimate FIBTEM after Preversal and the amount of cryoprecipitate needed for replacing mainly the fibrinogen could be predicted with high sensitivity and specificity."
CD010438,0,17150243,0,Thrombelastography monitoring of resistance to enoxaparin anticoagulation in thrombophilic pregnancy patients.,"The anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin is readily observed by Thrombelastography (TEG), particularly on the reaction time (R) to form a clot, and is completely reversed by heparinase. In this study, recalcified citrated whole blood with heparinase (CNHR) and without (CNR), along with TEG R time, was used to derive a delta R (CNR-CNHR). This delta R (DeltaR) was then used to measure enoxaparin anticoagulation, which was correlated by linear regression (r(2)=0.806) with plasma anti-Xa in 48 thrombophilic pregnancy patients. In a follow up study whole blood from 15 thrombophilic and 15 normal pregnancy subjects was titrated ex vivo with enoxaparin and TEG DeltaR determined. Linear dose responses (all r(2)>0.9) of DeltaR versus plasma enoxaparin concentration were obtained for each subject. A large variation in slope was observed for both thrombophilic (>7 fold, 217 to 1,588 s DeltaR/unit anti-Xa) and normal (>3 fold, 788 to 2,758) pregnancy subjects. The average slope for the thrombophilic group (710 s DeltaR/unit anti-Xa) was significantly (P=0.002) lower than the normal pregnancy group (1,354 s), indicating resistance to enoxaparin anticoagulation in the thrombophilic group. This technique may help gauge the appropriate dose of enoxaparin for each individual, check for residual anticoagulation before invasive procedures, and perhaps help screen for thrombophilic subjects."

The lowest dose of 0.5 mg/kg/24 hr tested here was thrombolytically effective, whereas a dose of 0.95 mg/kg/24 hours and more led to hemorrhagic complications and premature discontinuation of therapy in four of six patients. Blood clotting analysis did not reveal any substantial decrease in fibrinogen concentrations, whereas the euglobulin clot lysis time and thromboelastography demonstrated a systemic fibrinolytic effect. Therapy with rt-PA can thus be considered as an alternative and effective method of therapy in treatment of deep vein thrombosis. The results of this study show that even a dosage of lower than 0.5 mg/kg/24 hr might prove to be effective. Further studies would be required to show whether the fibrin specificity of rt-PA leads to a superiority of this fibrinolytic substance over the conventional thrombolytic agents, streptokinase and urokinase."

Preoperative platelet sequestration delays surgery, and the large volume shifts, necessary to harvest therapeutically effective components, may be associated with hemodynamic instability. We performed platelet and plasma sequestration after the initiation of CPB during the cooling period in patients undergoing surgery in deep hypothermic cardiac arrest. Five patients who underwent major vascular surgery in deep hypothermia were enrolled in this pilot study. Platelet and plasma sequestration was performed during cooling with the CATS cell saver using the plasma sequestration set. Before processing, 2 x 1,000 ml of blood were concentrated by means of hemofiltration to reduce dilution effects of CPB. The autologous platelet concentrates were rotated at 24 degrees C, and the plasma was stored at room temperature. The harvested plasma and platelets were re-transfused during modified ultrafiltration after CPB. Platelet count, 20 mmol/L ADP stimulated platelet aggregation, and fibrinogen levels were measured preoperatively in the harvested material and in patient blood before and after transfusion. A heparinase thromboelastogram (TEG) was performed preoperatively before and after re-transfusion. There was a significant increase in the ADP stimulated platelet aggregation, platelet count, fibrinogen level, and maximum amplitude of the TEG after re-transfusion of the harvested material. No patient needed transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or random donor platelet concentrates. No patient needed re-exploration due to hemorrhage. The data presented provide evidence that autologous plasma and platelet sequestration during CPB initiation is effective. The harvested material reveals a high platelet count and fibrinogen level and preserves functional integrity."

This study aimed to evaluate whether thromboelastography, a global whole-blood assay of coagulation, can be used to detect hypercoagulability in pediatric Fontan patients compared with healthy children. This prospective, cross-sectional study investigated 25 Fontan patients and 51 healthy children in three age groups: 1-5 years, 6-10 years, and 11-16 years. Kaolin-activated thromboelastography was performed on citrated samples. No statistically significant differences in thromboelastography parameters were found among the different age groups of the 51 healthy children. None of the 25 Fontan patients demonstrated evidence of hypercoagulability on thromboelastography (95% confidence interval, 0-7%), as defined by two standard deviations above or below the normal mean. The findings suggest that the percentage of Fontan patients demonstrating hypercoagulability on thromboelastography is substantially lower than the reported incidence of thromboembolic complications. Whether thromboelastography could be helpful in predicting patients at increased risk for thromboembolic complications or not still is not known. Further studies comparing the thromboelastography of Fontan patients with the thromboembolic complications of those without Fontan are needed to delineate these issues."

Besides the Quick test and APTT, thrombelastometry provides information about clot firmness and clot stability. This allows goal-directed management in coagulopathy, which results in a reduction of transfusion of blood products. Furthermore, this can lead to not only an overall reduced length of stay in the hospital, but also in the intensive care unit, thus, contributing to a significant cost reduction."

CD010438,0,12828667,0,Potential role of the dynamic properties of whole blood coagulation in assessment of dosage requirements in haemophilia.,"In the clinical setting, patients suffering from haemophilia are classified according to the residual level of the deficient coagulation factor. Patients suffering from the severe form of haemophilia (critical factor level <0.01 IU mL-1) display some heterogeneity in their tendency to bleeding despite the uniform factor level. Utilizing a new thrombelastographic method in which coagulation is activated by very small amounts of tissue factor and where resulting data are processed with new software, we studied the whole blood coagulation profile in 11 patients with severe haemophilia A and 11 patients with moderate haemophilia. In both groups of patients, we found a considerable degree of heterogeneity in the coagulation signal. In moderate haemophilia with factor VIII (FVIII):C levels between 0.01 and 0.05 IU mL-1, variance was expected, whereas a quite substantial diversity had not been forecasted in patterns of the whole blood coagulation profiles in patients with the severe form of haemophilia A. Ex vivo substitution to patient's blood to reach various theoretical levels of recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) revealed that the coagulation response to FVIII supplementation varied substantially. In some severely affected patients levels of FVIII:C close to 0.05 IU mL-1 was sufficient to normalize the coagulation profile, while others required a dose giving >0.50 IU mL-1 of FVIII to achieve a normal whole blood clotting profile. In conclusion, our study revealed that severe haemophilia A seems not to be a single entity, but rather several different clinical and biochemical phenotypes, and that the response to added FVIII varies amongst patients."

CD010438,0,11746529,0,Unintentional platelet removal by plasmapheresis.,"Therapeutic plasmapheresis may remove platelets as well as plasma. Unintentional platelet loss, if not recognized, may lead to inappropriate patient assessment and treatment. A patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is reported in whom persistent thrombocytopenia was interpreted as continuing active disease; thrombocytopenia resolved only after plasma exchange treatments were stopped. This observation prompted a systematic study of platelet loss with plasmapheresis. Data are reported on platelet loss during 432 apheresis procedures in 71 patients with six disease categories using three different instruments. Comparing the first procedure recorded for each patient, there was a significant difference among instrument types (P<0.001); platelet loss was greater with the Fresenius AS 104 (17.5%, N = 21) than with the COBE Spectra (1.6%, N = 26) or the Haemonetics LN9000 (2.6%, N = 24). With all procedures, platelet loss ranged from 0 to 71%. Among disease categories, platelet loss was greater in patients with dysproteinemias who were treated for hyperviscosity symptoms. Absolute platelet loss with the first recorded apheresis procedure, in the 34 patients who had a normal platelet count before the procedure, was also greater with the AS 104 (2.23 x 10(11) platelets) than with the Spectra (0.29 x 10(11) platelets) or the LN9000 (0.37 x 10(11) platelets). In 39 patients in whom data were collected on consecutive days, platelet removal by plasmapheresis correlated with a decreased patient platelet count (r = 0.40, P = 0.011).

CD010438,0,7725330,0,Action of Calloselasma rhodostoma (Malayan pit viper) venom on human blood coagulation and fibrinolysis using computerized thromboelastography (CTEG).,"The effects of Malayan pit viper (Calloselasma rhodostoma) venom on human blood coagulation and fibrinolysis were studied in vitro using computerized thromboelastography. At low concentrations the venom had a coagulant effect shown by faster onset of the coagulation process (shortened SP and R), faster progress of the clot (increased angle and shortened K), and increased coagulation (TEG) index. The maximum amplitude (MA) was not affected, suggesting that the venom had no apparent effect on platelet function; and clot lysis was similar to that in the controls, suggesting that there was no primary fibrinolytic activity. At higher concentrations the venom had anticoagulant effects, SP and R were progressively shortened, but there was poor/no progress in the clot formed, evident from prolonged or absent K, diminished MA and reduced angle. These results show that C. rhodostoma venom has both coagulant and anticoagulant actions. The coagulant action may be due to Factor X activator predominance at low concentrations, while the anticoagulant action could be due to ancrod action. TEG is able to demonstrate the dual effect of this venom, previously described as a paradox, and may be a useful tool in the diagnosis and monitoring of envenomation patients."
CD010438,0,21427234,0,Reference values of biochemical and hematological parameters for Guizhou minipigs.,"The pig is not only an economically important livestock animal but is also a valuable model animal for biomedical research and xenotransplantation. Reference values for clinical biochemical and hematological parameters are required for accurate data interpretation while using a pig model. In this study, whole blood samples were collected from 54 healthy Chinese Guizhou minipigs. We analyzed routine biochemical and hematological parameters and special coagulation parameters, including thrombelastography and coagulation factor activities, and have presented the baseline values of these parameters. These data provide valuable information for investigators using minipigs as animal models in biomedical studies and useful physiological data for veterinarians and livestock producers. We also compared all the results for the minipigs with the corresponding data from healthy humans. The bilirubin, uric acid and cholesterol levels of minipigs were significantly lower than those of humans (14%, 0.086% and 48% of human levels, respectively), whereas the serum enzyme levels were much higher than those in humans (e.g. the hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels of the minipigs were 19- and 8.4-fold higher than the human reference values). The red blood cell counts, platelet counts and white blood cell counts of the minipigs were significantly higher than those of the humans. The coagulation activities of factor VII and factor X were higher in minipigs than in humans. The significant differences observed between minipigs and humans for many of these parameters suggest substantial interspecies disparities in organs and tissues. These differences merit greater attention in biomedical research involving minipigs, particularly in the area of pig-to-human transplantation."

Before induction to anaesthesia 910 +/- 29.1 ml whole blood was taken and simultaneously replaced as follows: 50% of that amount with 3,6% albumin solution, another 50% X 3 with lactated Ringer solution. The haematocrit was thus lowered from 39.8 +/- 1.71 to 28.4 +/- 1.7 vol%. Extensive clotting studies were performed to investigate the early influence of haemodilution on the clotting mechanisms in the time span between the end of blood collection and the point of surgical anaesthesia. The group of patients with normal clotting studies prior to haemodilution has shown a slight and short-lasting hypercoagulability. This has been proven by a shortening of r and k in TEG, by a shortening of non-activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (means activation of the XII and XI factor) and also, by the presence of an activated factor Xa and by an increase of maximum platelet aggregation and of platelet factor 3 availability. This mechanism of clotting activation is similar to the one observed after marked blood loss. It was assumed that this minor, early and short-lasting hypercoagulability has no further influence on the well known usual intra- and post-operative changes in clotting mechanisms (intra-op lowered, post-op enhanced coagulability). In contrast to the patients with normal clotting, a clotting defect due to preexisting liver-cell damage becomes worse during the haemodilution, which method in the presence of hepatic insufficiency therefore is contraindicted. A few additional data on input-output, serum and urine electrolytes and on 2,3 DPG have been gathered during our study. They indicate a positive fluid balance and the necessity for a close watch of electrolytes. The possible trend of 2.3 DPG elevation which has also been found might reflect a compensatory mechanism increasing oxygen transport capacity of haemoglobin if the above described method of haemodilution is used."

The RLN of left side is likely to be found posterior to ITA and course mainly from 0 degrees up to 30 degrees based on TEG near cricothyroid joint while the nerve of right side is likely to be found anterior to ITA in right side and course mainly from 15 degrees up to 45 degrees based on TEG. The contacting point of RLN with ITA locate from the tip of cricoid cartilage at about three tenth of the distance from the tip of cricoid cartilage to sternal notch without reference to individual body size. 70 cadavers were investigated. The angle of RLN from TEG was measured at the cricothyroid joint. The relative position of RLN to ITA was classified. The location of the contacting point of RLN with ITA was measured and converted as an index. These findings suggest the area for careful dissection near cricothyroid joint, the configuration of RLN for identifying the nerve."

CD010438,0,3447197,0,[Hypercoagulable ulcers. Apropos of a recent case].,"We describe the case of a cafe waiter aged 38, with an extensive sub-malleolar left internal varicose ulcer, which was chronic and very painful. This ulcer had been developing for 17 years and had not cicatrized for two years, which meant professional invalidity despite repeated attempts at therapy (qualified local care in a special department, hospitalizations, stripping, and filament graft). In the absence of any arterial, deep venous or lymphatic affection, deep biological disturbances meant this ulcer was classed in the category of hypercoagulable ulcers. A heparin treatment transformed the local situation and made it possible for a complementary surgical graft. Vascular ulcers resistant to properly administered local, vascular and general treatments, should lead us to investigate the possibility of hypercoagulability, whose best parameter is the high index of potential thrombodynamic (I.P.T.) calculated according to the thromboelastogram on the total blood. These hypercoagulable ulcers can be cured with a prolonged heparin treatment, in doses sufficient to normalize the I.P.T. without having to investigate true hypercoagulability with the T.C.K. It seems to us that this treatment is most effectively carried out in hospital, where it is possible to achieve constant heparinization by electric syringe and reequilibration of the biological constants."
CD010438,0,7861453,0,Rapid infusion system for neurosurgical treatment of massive intraoperative hemorrhage.,"Using an illustrative case of severe closed head injury that resulted in a posterior fossa epidural hematoma (EDH) and supratentorial epidural/subdural hematomas (SDH), the massive blood losses associated with operative repair of the torn sigmoid sinus and the significant fluid losses associated with refractory diabetes insipidus were treated by the intraoperative use of the Rapid Infusion System (RIS, Haemonetics). The RIS can rapidly infuse warm blood, crystalloid, or colloid at rates up to 1.5 L/min, thereby limiting the commonly associated hypotension, hypothermia, and coagulopathies. During the suboccipital craniectomy for evacuation of the EDH and repair of the sigmoid sinus, the patient required 18 units of blood replacement secondary to a large tear in the sigmoid sinus. During a separate craniotomy for evacuation of the SDH, the patient also developed diabetes insipidus, which increased the operative fluid replacement to 39 L. Despite these massive blood and fluid losses, the RIS limited the hypotension to less than 2 min and prevented hypothermia and the frequently associated coagulopathies. When used in a neurosurgical setting associated with massive blood and/or fluid losses, the RIS accomplishes three important objectives: (1) rapid infusion of intravenous fluids for maintaining perfusion pressure, (2) rapid warming of fluids despite high intravenous infusion rates of cold crystalloids, thereby preventing intraoperative hypothermia, and (3) continuous monitoring of infusion rates and totals."

CD010438,0,20590862,0,Tests of global haemostasis and their applications in bleeding disorders.,"There is a potential for significant paradigm shift in the assessment of haemostasis from the conventional plasma recalcification times, such as prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), which correspond to artificially created compartments of haemostasis to tests that assess the entire process in a more physiological and holistic manner. These include the thrombin generation test, thromboelastogram and the clot wave form analysis. While these tests have been described many years ago, there is renewed interest in their use with modified technology for assessing normal haemostasis and its disorders. Although early data suggest that they can provide much greater information regarding the overall haemostasis process and its disorders, many challenges remain. Some of them are possible only on instruments that are proprietary technology, expensive and are not widely available. Furthermore, these tests need to be standardized with regard to their reagents, methodology and interpretation, and finally, much more data need to be collected regarding clinical correlations with the parameters measured."
CD010438,0,22776724,0,Current management of massive hemorrhage in trauma.,"Hemorrhage remains a major cause of potentially preventable deaths. Trauma and massive transfusion are associated with coagulopathy secondary to tissue injury, hypoperfusion, dilution, and consumption of clotting factors and platelets. Concepts of damage control surgery have evolved prioritizing early control of the cause of bleeding by non-definitive means, while hemostatic control resuscitation seeks early control of coagulopathy.Hemostatic resuscitation provides transfusions with plasma and platelets in addition to red blood cells in an immediate and sustained manner as part of the transfusion protocol for massively bleeding patients. Although early and effective reversal of coagulopathy is documented, the most effective means of preventing coagulopathy of massive transfusion remains debated and randomized controlled studies are lacking. Viscoelastical whole blood assays, like TEG and ROTEM however appear advantageous for identifying coagulopathy in patients with severe hemorrhage as opposed the conventional coagulation assays.In our view, patients with uncontrolled bleeding, regardless of it's cause, should be treated with hemostatic control resuscitation involving early administration of plasma and platelets and earliest possible goal-directed, based on the results of TEG/ROTEM analysis. The aim of the goal-directed therapy should be to maintain a normal hemostatic competence until surgical hemostasis is achieved, as this appears to be associated with reduced mortality."

ST depression, inverted T wave and other ECG changes were found in 49 (14.3%) of the 342 cytaphereses carried out by the intermittent flow centrifugation method and in 8 (4.7%) of the 169 PBSC collections by the continuous flow centrifugation method. This difference was significant (P < 0.05). The hemodynamic changes in the procedure with the AS104 seem to be small. This is considered to be important for prevention of serious ST and T wave changes."
CD010438,0,21549397,0,Bleeding and management of coagulopathy.,"Bleeding after cardiac surgery remains a significant problem, increasing both length of stay and mortality, and is caused by multiple factors including dilutional changes, ongoing fibrinolysis, and platelet dysfunction. The evaluation of coagulopathy is problematic because of the long turnaround time of standard coagulation tests. Algorithms involving point of care testing, including thromboelastography and thromboelastometry, have been published; all have the potential to reduce transfusion requirements. Massive transfusion coagulopathy that occurs in trauma can also be seen in complex aortic surgery and other massive bleeding patients and should prompt consideration of a transfusion protocol involving fixed ratios of fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and red blood cells. Pharmacologic agents such as antifibrinolytics are commonly administered, but a multimodal approach to management is important. Recombinant and purified coagulation products are being studied and provide clinicians specific agents to treat targeted deficiencies. A general multi-modal approach is required and recommendations are made for the management of bleeding and coagulopathy in cardiac surgical patients."
CD010438,0,22867727,0,Postpartum hemorrhage management in 2012: predicting the future.,"Transfusion therapy in postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) traditionally has been modeled after precedents set in the Vietnam and Korean wars. However, data from recent military combat casualties suggest a different transfusion strategy. Transfusion of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets in a ratio of 1:1:1 improves dilutional coagulopathy and survival. Women who present with low fibrinogen at the time of diagnosis of PPH have poorer outcomes and might benefit from early fibrinogen replacement. The antifibrinolytic agent, tranexamic acid, decreases bleeding and progression to severe PPH, but its role in PPH management is evolving. Observational data suggest that the use of recombinant factor VIIa should be limited to bleeding that has not responded to an optimal transfusion strategy. Point-of-care testing using thromboelastography is helpful in guiding the selection of blood products to be transfused. Additionally, massive transfusion protocols can decrease the overall number of products transfused and improve outcomes."

Other investigators have observed various activation patterns of factor VII in four deficient families which were tested with thromboplastins from different sources. In contrast to most of these earlier studies the degree of activation with different thromboplastins was very similar regardless which thromboplastin was tested. These results confirm the heterogeneity of the factor VII defect. Platelet aggregation which was tested in one of the propositi with ADP, adrenaline, and collagen was found to be normal. No cold activation of factor VII was observed."

We report on the use and monitoring of low dose, recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa, NovoSeven®), to cover surgery (caesarean section, cholecystectomy and abdominoplasty) in four female patients (FXI:C 2-4 IU/dl, aged 32-51 years) who wished to avoid exposure to plasma. None of our patients had inhibitors to FXI. Our aim was to find the optimal dose of rFVIIa by in vitro spiking of patient samples and to correlate this with the response to rFVIIa in vivo . Prior to surgery, venous blood was collected into sodium citrate with corn trypsin inhibitor and spiked with 0.25-1.0 μg/ml rFVIIa in vitro , equivalent to a 15-70 μg/kg dose of rFVIIa in vivo . Analysis using thromboelastometry and thrombin generation assays, triggered with tissue factor, showed that the thrombin generation assay was insufficiently sensitive to the haemostatic defect in these patients. A concentration of 0.5 μg/ml was as effective as 1.0 μg/ml FVIIa in normalising thromboelastometry in vitro in all four patients. Therefore, patients received 15-30 μg/kg rFVIIa at 2-4 hourly intervals with tranexamic acid 1g every six hours. Post treatment samples were taken at 10-240 minutes and showed initial normalisation of thromboelastometry with gradual return to baseline after 2-4 hours. In conclusion, low-dose rFVIIa therapy was successfully used in four patients with severe FXI deficiency undergoing surgery to prevent bleeding and can be monitored using thromboelastometry."

CD010438,0,3126342,0,[Thrombolytic therapy of deep venous thrombosis with rt-PA].,"Recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was given to seven patients with phlebographically documented deep vein thrombosis at a dose of 60-120 mg/day (0.71-1.76 mg/kg body weight/24 h) for 2 to 4 days. rt-PA induced evident recanalization in 6 of 7 cases. The lowest here used dose of 0.71 mg/kg/24 h was thrombolytical highly effective, but a dose of 1.4 mg/kg/24 h and over was accompanied by bleeding from venous puncture sites. Coagulation analysis showed no obvious decrease of fibrinogen, while euglobulin clot lysis time and thrombelastography demonstrated the systemic fibrinolytic activity. Thus, therapy with rt-PA may represent an alternative and effective therapeutic procedure in treatment of venous thrombosis. The initial results make a case for expanded investigational use of rt-PA in patients with deep vein thrombosis to clarify conceivable advantages of therapy with this fibrin selective thrombolytic agent."

Enhanced fibrinolysis following dilution with HES has been demonstrated. This investigation sought to identify the interactions of HES with critical fibrinolytic/antifibrinolytic enzymes. Normal plasma or plasmas deficient in factor XIII, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor or alpha2-antiplasmin were either not diluted or were diluted 20% with 0.9% NaCl, 5% human albumin, high-molecular-weight HES (HES 450) or low-molecular-weight HES (HES 130). Plasma was activated with celite and exposed to 75 IU/ml tissue-type plasminogen activator. Coagulation growth/disintegration kinetics were determined with thrombelastography. Compared with undiluted plasma, diluted plasma had a significant decrease in the clot lysis time and the time to maximum rate of lysis in all plasma types except in alpha2-antiplasmin-deficient plasma. The hierarchy of the decrease in clot lysis time and time to maximum rate of lysis was HES 450 = HES 130 > 5% human albumin = 0.9% NaCl. In conclusion, HES dilution enhances fibrinolysis by diminishing alpha2-antiplasmin-plasmin interactions. Further laboratory and clinical investigation is warranted to better define the mechanisms by which HES enhances clot disintegration and to find new therapeutic roles for HES to either prevent or treat thrombosis."
CD010438,0,19225670,0,Synthesis of hydrophilic conjugated porphyrin dimers for one-photon and two-photon photodynamic therapy at NIR wavelengths.,"We report the synthesis of a series of hydrophilic butadiyne-linked conjugated zinc porphyrin dimers, designed as photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents. These porphyrin dimers exhibit exceptionally high two-photon absorption cross sections (delta(max) approximately 8,000-17,000 GM) and red-shifted linear absorption spectra (lambda(max) approximately 700-800 nm) making them ideal candidates for one-photon and two-photon excited photodynamic therapy. Four polar triethyleneglycol substituents are positioned along the sides of each dimer, but, on their own, these TEG chains do not confer sufficient solubility in aqueous physiological media for reproducible delivery into live cells. Charged cationic (methylpyridinium and trimethylammonium) and anionic (sulfonate and carboxylate) substituents have been appended to the meso-positions of porphyrin dimers using three synthetic strategies: 1) Suzuki coupling, 2) Sonogashira coupling, and 3) nucleophilic Senge arylation. Approaches 1 and 3 both allow attachment of aromatic substituents directly to the meso-positions of porphyrins. Approach 2 provides a route to hydrophilic porphyrin dimers with an ethyne link between the porphyrin and the polar aromatic substituent. The palladium-catalysed approaches 1 and 2 allow the synthesis of a broader range of meso-capped porphyrins, as many aryl halides are available. However the synthesis of the intermediate required for these routes necessitates a statistical reaction step, which decreases the overall yield. On the other hand, Senge-arylation provides highly regioselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution, and offers higher overall yield than the other routes. All these charged dimers exhibit good solubility in polar solvents (e.g. methanol) and aqueous solvent mixtures (aqueous DMSO or DMF)."
CD010438,0,10850560,0,Management and monitoring of recombinant activated factor VII.,"Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has recently been introduced as a new 'bypassing' agent to improve haemostasis in haemophilia patients with inhibitors to factor (F) VIII or FIX. In noninhibitor patients, levels of circulating FVIII or FIX can be used to assess the quality of substitution therapy. In contrast, laboratory monitoring of haemostatic efficacy in patients treated with rFVIIa has proved more complex. Evaluation of patient samples saved during rFVIIa treatment have revealed some correlation between FVII:C levels and improved haemostasis, while whole blood elasticity, as determined by thromboelastography, has been shown to improve following rFVIIa treatment. The investigation aimed to study the efficacy of rFVIIa in activating FX:C and in shortening the whole blood clotting time (WBCT) using the newly-developed roTEG coagulation instrument. Results indicated a substantial and apparently dose-dependent activation of FX:C by rFVIIa. In addition, the presence of FIX appeared to influence FX:C activation. In-vitro and ex-vivo roTEG thromboelastograph measurements showed that FVIIa shortened WBCT, although normalization did not occur. The results presented here are based on a small number of observations in a few patients and further studies should be planned to test the efficacy of these monitoring principles in clinical treatment practice with rFVIIa."
CD010438,0,16480437,0,An audit of red cell and blood product use after the institution of thromboelastometry in a cardiac intensive care unit.,"Cardiac surgery is estimated to use 20% of the UK blood supply. However, there has been much interest recently in decreasing red cell and blood product use not only to ease strain on blood stocks or avoid potential transmission of infection but also to decrease post-operative transfusion-related complications. Coagulopathies are not uncommon in cardiac surgical patients, but the time lapse for reporting conventional laboratory results has been highlighted as an obstacle to the appropriate use of blood products. Accordingly, much interest has arisen in rapid near-patient testing of coagulation and, in January 2002, a thromboelastometer (ROTEM, Pentapharm, Germany) was purchased for our unit. This audit sought to assess its impact by retrospective analysis of 990 sequential patients' demographic data and transfusion details covering 6 months prior to its introduction and 6 months after. In the 6 months prior to its introduction, red cells were used in 60% of patients and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets used in 17 and 16% of patients, respectively. In the following 6 months, red cell use had fallen to 53% and FFP and platelets to 12 and 11%, respectively (P < 0.05). Introduction of thromboelastometry has significantly decreased our use of red cells and blood products."

The most significant alterations concerning platelets and hemolysis have been found in patients with Starr-Edwards prostheses. Even in tissue valves, major alterations of the clotting system and chronic intravascular hemolysis were found. For long-term anticoagulation in mechanical prostheses--even with sinus rhythm--vitamin K antagonists should be preferred. During the first months of gravidity only heparin can be recommended. In St. Jude Medical valves anticoagulation with dicumarolum must be recommended; whether antiaggregation drugs can be recommended is not yet proved. Anticoagulation may be discontinued three months after tissue valve implantation if there are no additional risk factors. Diminishing platelet adhesivity in tissue valves may support these conclusions."

Both solutions significantly compromised blood coagulation as evidenced by an increase in coagulation time and decrease in angle alpha, maximum amplitude and coagulation index (p < 0.05). Blood coagulation was more compromised during haemodilution with potato starch derived hydroxyethyl starch as compared with corn starch derived hydroxyethyl starch (p < 0.05). When taking the effect of haemodilution with 0.9% saline into account, haemodilution with both hydroxyethyl starch solutions also augmented clot lysis (p < 0.05), with potato starch derived hydroxyethyl starch having a greater effect than corn starch derived hydroxyethyl starch (p < 0.05). We conclude that potato starch derived hydroxyethyl starch compromises in vitro blood coagulation more than corn starch derived hydroxyethyl starch."

Plasma was obtained from patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery requiring CPB. Whole blood was collected and anticoagulated with sodium citrate after induction of anesthesia and again after CPB and heparin neutralization with protamine. Blood samples were centrifuged for 15 min, with plasma collected and stored at -80°C prior to analysis. Samples were subsequently exposed to 0 or 100 μmol/l CORM-2, with coagulation activated with tissue factor. Data were collected with thrombelastography until clot strength stabilized. Patients underwent CPB for 133 ± 61 min (mean ± SD). The velocity of thrombus formation was significantly decreased (52%) by CPB, as was clot strength (53%). Addition of CORM-2 to plasma samples obtained after CPB significantly increased the velocity of clot formation (75%) and strength (52%) compared to matched unexposed samples. The lesion of plasmatic coagulation associated with CPB was significantly improved in vitro by addition of CORM-2. If preclinical assessments of efficacy and safety of CORM-2 are favorable, future clinical trials involving CORM-2 or other CORMs as a hemostatic intervention in the setting of CPB are justified."

CD010438,0,16607085,0,Elastic modulus-based thrombelastographic quantification of plasma clot fibrinolysis with progressive plasminogen activation.,"Thrombelastographic detection of fibrinolysis has been critical in the identification and treatment of coagulopathy in many perioperative settings. However, the fibrinolytic assessments have been at best non-parametric, amplitude-based determinations (e.g. estimated % lysis, clot lysis time or clot lysis rate). Recognizing this limitation, a methodology was developed to measure the onset, speed and extent of clot disintegration by changes in elastic modulus derived from the amplitude. Using this approach, our goal was to characterize the clot disintegration kinetics of progressive plasminogen activation with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and to determine the extent of inhibition of fibrinolysis mediated by tPA with aprotinin and activated factor XIII. While the estimated % lysis and clot lysis time were significantly affected by tPA (0-300 U/ml), elastic modulus-based analyses in a more activity-specific fashion demonstrated significantly decreased onset, increased rate and increased extent of fibrinolysis. Furthermore, aprotinin was found to inhibit the onset, rate and extent of fibrinolysis in an activity-dependent fashion, whereas activated factor XIII was noted to enhance the speed of onset of clot growth and delay the onset of fibrinolysis. In summary, our results serve as the rational basis to utilize this elastic modulus-based approach to quantify the extent of fibrinolysis in clinical and laboratory settings, as well as potentially guiding antifibrinolytic therapy."

Brisbane, Australia), currently developed as an anticoagulant and antiproliferative agent, mainly is composed of a pentomannan. However, tetrasaccharide and disaccharide components are also present. The molecular profile and the anticoagulant potency of PI-88 are investigated in this study. Gel permeation chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses were carried out to determine the molecular profile and separation of components of PI-88, respectively. Potentiation of antithrombin III (ATIII) and heparin cofactor-II (HC-II) activity were measured using chromogenic substrate assay. In order to determine anticoagulant and antiprotease effects of PI-88, various global anticoagulant tests, such as the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), Hep-test (Haemachem Inc., St. Louis), ecarin clotting time (ECT), activated clotting time (ACT), and thromboelastography (TEG) were used. Anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities also were measured.

The relative susceptibility of PI-88 to heparinase I, protamine sulfate (PS), and platelet factor 4 (PF4) also was evaluated. The high-performance liquid chromatography profiles of PI-88 showed that its average molecular weight is approximately 2300 Da. Separation and gradient electrophoretic patterns of PI-88 showed that it is composed of five different fractions. This agent activates HC-II through inhibiting the thrombin generation but not inhibiting ATIII. Although PI-88 produced a concentration-dependent prolongation of all of the clotting tests, ECT gave the best correlation in the dose-response curve (ECT, r2 = 0.94; TT, r2 = 0.84; APTT, r2 = 0.69). Heparinomimetic mannopentaose phosphate sulfate (PI-88) exhibited marked inhibition of FIIa, but not of FXa. Heparinase I failed to produce significant neutralization of PI-88 in all the assays used, whereas PS and PF4 partially neutralized the effects of this compound. Heparinomimetic mannopentaose phosphate sulfate (PI-88) produced fivefold increase in the TFPI levels at 15 minutes after intravenous (IV) injection to primates. The incubation of PI-88 in endothelial cell culture system also showed a strong effect on TFPI release. These results suggest that PI-88 exhibited strong antithrombotic and anticoagulant activity in addition to its known antiproliferative properties. Because of the molecular characteristics and the dual nature of the pharmacologic action of PI-88, this agent represents an attractive pharmacologic agent for the control of thrombotic and proliferative disorders."
CD010438,0,14971899,0,"Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugates targeted to breast cancer cells.","The anthracycline antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX) has been utilized for decades as a broad-spectrum chemotherapeutic. Recent literature evidence documents the role of formaldehyde in the cytotoxic mechanism, and anthracycline-formaldehyde conjugates possess substantially enhanced activity in vitro and in vivo. Targeting a doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate specifically to cancer cells may provide a more efficacious chemotherapeutic. The design and 11-step synthesis of doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugates targeted to the estrogen receptor, which is commonly overexpressed in breast cancer cells, are reported. The formaldehyde is incorporated in a masked form as an N-Mannich linkage between doxorubicin and salicylamide. The salicylamide triggering molecule, previously developed to release the doxorubicin-formaldehyde active metabolite, is tethered via derivatized ethylene glycols to an E and Z mixture of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. The targeting group, E/Z-4-hydroxytamoxifen, was selected for its ability to tightly bind the estrogen receptor and antiestrogen binding sites. The targeted doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugates' estrogen receptor binding and in vitro growth inhibition were evaluated as a function of tether length. The lead compound, DOX-TEG-TAM, bearing a triethylene glycol tether, binds the estrogen receptor with a binding affinity of 2.5% relative to E/Z-4-hydroxytamoxifen and inhibits the growth of four breast cancer cell lines with 4-fold up to 140-fold enhanced activity relative to doxorubicin."

Patients received placebo (n = 30) or TA 15 mg/kg before CPB, followed by a TA infusion of 1 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 5 h (n = 30) or TA 15 mg/kg after CPB, followed by a TA infusion of 1 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 5 h (n = 30). Demographic, medical, surgical, laboratory, mediastinal chest tube drainage (MCTD), hemoglobin loss, transfusion, and outcome data were collected. Allogenic blood product administration was tightly controlled. The demographic, medical, and surgical characteristics were similar in all three groups. The median postoperative MCTD and hemoglobin loss in the pre-CPB TA group (710 mL, 8.6 g) was significantly less (P < 0.001) compared with the control (1202 mL, 44.2 g) and post-CPB TA groups (1020 mL, 23.4 g). The percentage of patients who received no allogenic blood products was 27% for the pre-CPB TA group and 33% for the post-CPB TA group (not significant). These percentages were significantly lower than those in the placebo group (66%, P < 0.001). The median number of allogenic blood products administered to the pre-CPB TA group (0 units) was significantly less compared with the control group (4.5 units). The thromboelastogram and fibrinogen split product levels in the pre-CPB TA group indicated better platelet function and less activation of the fibrinolytic system compared with the other two groups (P < 0.05). There were no intergroup differences in reoperation, myocardial infarction, stroke, infections, or death. These data support the use of pre-CPB TA to decrease patient exposure to postcardiopulmonary bypass allogenic blood products."

Daily TEG(R) parameters were obtained until the epidural catheter was removed. TEG(R) parameters include reaction time (R-time or time until the first significant levels of detectable clot formation), K-time (clot firmness), maximum amplitude (MA-clot strength), alpha angle (clot development), and coagulation index (overall coagulation). In addition, daily international normalized ratios (INRs) were obtained as per our routine practice. On the day of catheter removal reaction time was significantly increased compared with preoperative values (p < 0.0001), but it remained within normal ranges. There was no change in the coagulation index. However, INR was abnormal and significantly increased (INR = 1.48+/-0.3; p < 0.0001), compared with preoperative values, on the day when the epidural catheter was removed. When the epidural catheters are removed, overall coagulation status, as measured by TEG(R), and despite an elevated INR (mean INR <1.5), remained within normal limits in patients receiving low-dose warfarin prophylaxis."
CD010438,0,22221936,0,"Global haemostasis assays, from bench to bedside.","Bleeding and thrombosis are the ultimate clinical outcomes of aberrations in the haemostatic process. Haemostasis prevents excessive blood loss due to the effort of various compartments like the vasculature, blood cells, coagulation and fibrinolysis. The complexity of all processes involved makes the diagnosis of aberrations difficult, cumbersome and expensive. A single assay to detect any factor disturbing this haemostatic balance with high sensitivity and specificity would be of great value, especially if the outcome of this assay correlates well with clinical outcome. Despite years of research, such an assay is not yet available; however, some interesting candidates are under development and combine the effects of various compartments. This review describes the development of global haemostasis assays and summarizes the current state of the art of these haemostasis assays covering thrombin and plasmin generation, turbidity and thromboelastography/thromboelastometry. Finally, we discuss the applicability of global assays in clinical practice and we provide a future perspective on the ongoing development of automation and miniaturisation as it is our belief that these developments will benefit the standardization of global haemostasis assays."

They have been developed in close collaboration with haemostasis groups and therefore gain a benefit from these links. Conversely, TEG provides very important information except it has never been validated. The number of collaborative studies with biologists has to increase in order to implement the use of TEG in the routine practice."

A Haemonetics MCS-3P and a Cobe Spectra machine were used to leukapherese 10 patients with malignant diseases on 4 consecutive days after mobilization with G-CSF. All patients were harvested twice on each machine for a fixed period of time. The blood volume processed (10.47 vs 3.79 l, P < 0.001), MNC yield (2.66 vs 0.90 x 10(8)/kg; P < 0.001), MNC yield rate (1.66 vs 0.55 x 10(6)/kg/min; P < 0.001), MNC purity (81 vs 42%; P < 0.001), CFU-GM yield (18.1 vs 5.5 x 10(4)/kg; P = 0.001), and CFU-GM yield rate (11.27 vs 3.42 x 10(2)/kg/min; P = 0.001) were significantly higher with the Spectra. The CD34+ cell yields and yield rates were comparable. Although CFU-GM and MNC yields per unit blood volume processed were comparable for both machines, there was a trend for higher CD34+ yields per unit volume processed with MCS-3P. We conclude that Spectra is faster than MCS-3P with more blood processed per unit time resulting in higher cell yields, but yields per unit volume processed are comparable for both machines. The choice of machine for a given patient depends upon convenience, venous access and the time available."

The fibrin polymerization process, followed by turbidity, showed that the rate of fibrin monomer assembly and the final turbidity was increased in the pregnant group (normal and with history of RM) compared to non-pregnant women (normal and RM), which is consistent with the increased fibrinogen concentration during pregnancy. No changes were observed in the Darcy constant (Ks) of RM clots, pregnant or not; however, in pregnant control subjects the Ks increased (p = 0.03). The fibrin lysis rate was increased in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant, being faster in women with RM. The rheological properties of the fibrin network in the non-pregnant group (control and RM patients) were similar; in the pregnant state, the fibrin network of the control group was 1.3 times stiffer compared to the control non-pregnant women, and almost unchanged in RM patients. In this study we have found changes in the clot structure that seem to be related to normal pregnancy and an increased rate of the fibrin lysis process in the RM patients, which may have clinical relevance."

Platelet count was significantly increased in group 2 in respect to group 3 (P < 0.05) and fibrinogen level was significantly increased in group 2 in respect to group 1 (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between subgroups in respect to TEG parameters. Tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages of patients was not also associated with either of TEG parameters. Correlation analysis revealed significant correlation between laboratory parameters and ROTEM parameters. Fibrinogen showed the strongest correlation with MCF (r > 0.7) and CFT in all assays (INTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM, APTEM). There were also statistically significant correlations between platelet number and other ROTEM parameters (INTEM-CFT, -MCF, EXTEM-CFT, -MCF, FIBTEM-MCF, APTEM-CFT, -MCF). In conclusions, our data demonstrates thromboelastographic signs of hypercoagulability in patients with solid tumors. ROTEM is able to identify the contribution of fibrinogen and platelets to clot strength in this patient population."

CD010438,0,2597614,0,The plasma collection system: a new concept in autotransfusion.,"We have used the Haemonetics Cell-Saver autotransfusion technique in over 6,500 cases since 1979, salvaging more than 11,000 units of packed red blood cells. Major utilization has been in cardiac, vascular, and orthopedic cases. Coagulopathy associated with hypothermia, shock, multiple transfusions, and the autotransfusion technique, which removes clotting factors and platelets, often necessitated use of fresh-frozen plasma and platelet packs postoperatively to control bleeding and clotting problems. However, this defeats the prevention of disease transmission, transfusion reaction, and autoimmunization. Haemonetics has recently developed a plasma collection system which salvages up to 1,000 cc of platelet-rich plasma. Early experience suggests this technique will not only decrease the incidence of postoperative bleeding but further decrease the use of homologous (bank) blood and components. A step-by-step guide to the plasma collection system is discussed. The plasma collection system augments the present autotransfusion technique that conserves red blood cells, thus making complete autologous blood transfusion a reality."
CD010438,0,21883380,0,Dalteparin dose-dependently increases ROTEM(®) thrombelastography parameters only at supratherapeutic anti-factor Xa levels: an in vitro study.,"1. The low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) dalteparin is used, for example, to prevent primary venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing surgery or in medically ill patients. The anticoagulant activity of dalteparin can be monitored by measuring anti-factor Xa levels and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT); however, aPTT is an unreliable parameter in this case. The aim of the present in vitro study was to evaluate the thrombelastograph ROTEM(®) (Tem International, Munich, Germany) with respect to determining the anticoagulant activity of dalteparin at therapeutic and supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. 2. The ROTEM(®) parameters, namely coagulation time (CT), clot formation time (CFT) and maximum clot firmness (MCF), were measured using the reagents EXTEM and INTEM (Pentapharm, Munich, Germany) at increasing concentrations of dalteparin (0.01-10 μg/mL, which corresponded to anti-factor Xa levels of 1-1000 U/mL, respectively). 3. The mean CT measured using EXTEM was found to increase from 65.4 ± 27.9 s at baseline to 173.3 ± 112.2 s and 332.2 ± 200.7 s at drug concentrations of 1 and 10 μg/mL, respectively (P < 0.0001 for both). Moreover, the mean CFT value (EXTEM) increased from 97.7 ± 21.5 s at baseline to 187.6 ± 115.2 s (P = 0.0001) at a drug concentration of 10 μg/mL, which is greater than the therapeutic anti-factor Xa concentrations for LMWH. The results obtained when INTEM was used as the reagent were similar to those obtained using EXTEM. 4. In conclusion, the results indicate that the thrombelastograph ROTEM(®) can detect the anticoagulant effects of dalteparin only at supratherapeutic levels of anti-factor Xa."

CD010438,0,20410815,0,Thrombocytopenia affects plasmatic coagulation as measured by thrombelastography.,"Thrombelastography (TEG) is used as a point-of-care test of hemostasis. Different components of the test tracing are considered to reflect various parts of the hemostatic system and to distinguish low platelet count, platelet dysfunction or both from lack of plasmatic coagulation factors. To analyze the influence of one single element of the coagulation system, namely the platelet count, we used TEG serially in patients with well documented transient thrombocytopenia. A total of 189 TEG analyses were performed from 16 patients with a hematological malignancy in remission, receiving consolidation courses of chemotherapy. TEG outcomes using unmanipulated and citrated blood samples at a median of 11 times (range 1-17) in the same patients during the decrease of platelet count in response to chemotherapy were compared with outcomes in 120 healthy adults from various age categories. We found a correlation (r = 0.7, P < 0.001) between TEG clot strength (maximum amplitude) and platelet count. Moreover, platelet count was correlated respectively with the initial rate of clot formation (reaction time and clotting time), the rate of clot growth (alpha angle), and also with maximum thrombus generation, time to maximum thrombus generation and total thrombus generation. We conclude that platelet count not only affects the strength of clot formation, as was expected, but also all other phases of plasmatic coagulation. Citration of the blood sample, aiming at easy storage of the material, masked some of the important biological parameters of coagulation."
CD010438,0,22102528,0,Standardized methods to quantify thrombogenicity of blood-contacting materials via thromboelastography.,"Blood coagulation is the most significant complication of vascular biomaterials. A straightforward, sensitive, and standard measure of the compatibility of these materials with whole blood (hemocompatibility) is necessary to avoid coagulation. Current techniques used quantify only individual clotting components and are poor predictors of coagulation. The thromboelastograph (TEG) provides a measure of overall clot formation from whole blood. Although TEG is very common in clinical settings, its application to biomaterials is limited partly due to difficulty in sample preparation. In this protocol, whole blood samples are incubated with (1) biomaterials (tube with clamped ends) and (2) endothelial cells cultured on biomaterial surfaces (12-well plate) under controlled shearing conditions (10 rpm on rocker, at 37°C), and then the blood is transferred to the TEG to measure clot formation. TEG clearly discriminates among the R-times (time until initial clot formation) of expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene), poly(urethane), and Tygon tubing. Marked differences in R-time are also seen when endothelial cells are cultured on various extracellular matrix proteins and proteoglycans. Thus, R-time provides a robust metric of overall thrombogenicity of biomaterials, and these procedures provide a standardized method for TEG to facilitate direct comparison among candidate biomaterials undergoing in-vitro testing."

CD010438,0,18494689,0,New advances in the therapeutic and laboratory management of patients with haemophilia and inhibitors.,"The management of haemophilia patients with high inhibitor titres remains a major clinical challenge. In this manuscript, we present the new developments in the treatment and laboratory monitoring of these patients. First, we discuss a general treatment algorithm to control severe bleeding episodes in these patients, established by an international panel of haemophilia specialists. The main features of this algorithm concern (i) the optimal timing of clinical and therapeutic decisions and (ii) the appropriate use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) or activated prothrombin complex concentrates. However, until the clinical value of this algorithm is validated in real-world practice, the use of single high doses of rFVIIa should be considered as a valuable therapeutic option. Secondly, we present four laboratory assays, potential surrogate markers for the efficacy of bypassing agents used in haemophilia patients with high titre inhibitors. Preliminary data suggest that some of these tests, notably thromboelastography and the thrombin generation test, may be helpful for predicting the individual bleeding risk and for providing individually tailored treatment regimens. Overall, it may be hoped that these new developments will lead to a marked improvement in the clinical management of haemophilia patients with inhibitors in the near future."

Despite thrombolytic therapy with the recommended maximal bolus of 50 mg recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), thrombelastometry showed no signs of fibrinolysis and cardiogenic shock persisted, after only a transient hemodynamic improvement. Not until a repeat bolus of 25 mg rt-PA and an infusion of 50 mg/h did thrombelastometry demonstrate complete fibrinolysis. Although only residual emboli were seen on computed tomography, the patient died secondary to refractory right heart failure. This demonstrates that the standard dosing of thrombolytics may fail in a subgroup of patients, and suggests that thrombelastometry may be useful for early dose adjustment when standard dosing regimens fail."

Platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate and collagen, as well as measurement of the maximum amplitude of the thrombelastograph (TEG), was undertaken in vitro using venous blood exposed to low concentrations of prostacyclin (0, 10, 100 and 500 pg/ml) from eight healthy volunteers. There were statistically significant reductions in parameters of platelet aggregation in response to the agonists adenosine diphosphate (1 mumol/l and 8 mumol/l) and collagen (10 mumol/l) following exposure to as little as 10 pg/ml of prostacyclin. The maximum amplitude of the TEG was unchanged over the entire range of prostacyclin concentrations studied. The results indicate that low concentrations of prostacyclin or prostacyclin metabolite such as may be observed during inhaled aerosolized prostacyclin therapy are likely to be associated with a marked platelet aggregation defect. This defect was not detected by the TEG."

Evidence suggests inconsistent bioavailability in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Antifactor Xa activity (anti-Xa) has been used to monitor enoxaparin dosing but its accuracy and availability are problematic. Thrombelastography (TEG) is used to evaluate coagulation in diverse settings. The purpose of this study was to analyze whether TEG could be used to predict which enoxaparin-treated patients would develop DVT.
CD010438,0,8470257,0,Coagulation and liver transplantation.,"In summary, both a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of coagulopathies and an understanding of the proper replacement and pharmacologic therapies based on TEG monitoring of coagulability are essential in the management of coagulation. As stated by Starzl, ""Now cautious correction of coagulation defects is an integral part of liver transplantation, greatly diminishing the hemorrhages of nightmare proportions that were common."""
CD010438,0,22343443,0,[Thromboelastography].,"Coagulopathies of various origins have been mentioned among the leading causes of morbidity in hospitals all over the world. Time-consuming coagulation assays delay the diagnosis and response to a dynamic pathology. The need to analyse whole blood for the accurate identification of coagulopathies has led to a revival of interest in thromboelastography (TEG). This simple test can be performed at the bedside using non-anticoagulated blood, and enables complex assessment of extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of coagulation and fibrinolysis. TEG can be also used to predict postoperative bleeding and/or organ dysfunction. TEG has been widely used in research, but poor understanding of the technique has limited its clinical use. Controversies regarding the relationship between traditional tests and TEG have made the bedside use of TEG less popular than it should be. In the review, the authors discuss details of the process and practical aspects of its use in clinical settings."
CD010438,0,11099891,0,Single automated donor plateletpheresis increases the plasma level of proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha which does not associate with endothelial release markers von Willebrand factor and fibronectin.,"The effect of plateletpheresis on endothelium, which has strong effects on blood coagulation, fibrinolysis and platelet function, is not known. Activation of leukocytes and subsequent generation of proinflammatory cytokines during the extracorporeal circulation may activate the endothelium. To test this hypothesis we measured plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha as a prototype of the proinflammatory cytokines, and von Willebrand factor (vWF) and fibronectin as endothelial release/damage markers before and after a single plateletpheresis procedure on an intermittent-flow machine Haemonetics MCS 3p in 17 healthy donors. We found a significant increase in median plasma level of TNF-alpha following plateletpheresis (3.5 vs 26.5 pg/ml, P=0.02). Such increases in vWF and fibronectin were not observed. The increase in plasma TNF-alpha indicates that a single plateletpheresis procedure causes leukocyte activation which does not seemingly impair endothelial cell function. The relation of plateletpheresis-induced proinflammatory cytokine release to some adverse effects observed in both donors and recipients, and the effect of repeated plateletpheresis on endothelium deserve further studies."

CD010438,0,8362252,0,Retrospective statistical analysis of coagulation parameters after 250 liver transplantations.,"Extensive transfusion of blood components as a typical feature of OLT has been described by many authors. The perioperative requirement for transfusion, however, follows a downward trend, although the indications for OLT have been extended. Functional disturbances such as hyperfibrinolysis or platelet dysfunction, demonstrated by laboratory tests, such as platelet counts, PT, aPTT, TT, fibrinogen, and ATIII are often used to direct the transfusion of blood components, although preoperative data give insight only into the insufficient function of the old liver, which will be explanted and replaced by the donor graft. We have described a retrospective statistical analysis of laboratory data, clinical data, and perioperative blood requirements from 250 liver transplantations performed in our hospital from 1988 to 1992. The OLT was performed according to the usual surgical methods using a venovenous bypass system. Intraoperatively, volume was restored with packed RBC and FFP according to hemodynamic data, hemoglobin, and diuresis; clotting data were not used as indications for blood replacement. This analysis demonstrated that neither preoperative nor intraoperative clotting parameters were able to allow a prediction of the intraoperative requirement for transfusion of blood components; these findings parallel those of previous reports. With respect to other studies showing that perioperative transfusion rates correlated with postoperative infections and mortality, we strongly suggest that perioperative clotting measures as indicators for transfusion requirement should be analyzed with caution. Whether other diagnostic methods such as TEG are useful alternatives has to be determined."
CD010438,0,18581079,0,[Platelet function analysis with point-of-care methods].,"More and more patients are treated with antiplatelet drugs today. In this context a sufficient inhibition of platelet aggregation, on the one hand, is of essential importance to the efficiency of prophylaxis of myocardial and cerebral infarction and to avoiding thrombosis of drug-eluting stents. On the other hand, this medication can result in an increased risk of perioperative bleeding. In both situations control of the efficiency of therapy or rather the assessment of the impairment of hemostasis is of vital importance."
CD010438,0,14985175,0,The influence of red wine or white wine intake on platelet function and viscoelastic property of blood in volunteers.,"Since the consumption of wine in the United States has increased in recent years, a number of patients may be admitted to the hospital on the morning of their elective surgery after having consumed wine with dinner the evening before. Research indicates that by reducing platelet aggregation, moderate alcohol consumption can protect against the development of coronary artery disease. Therefore, an alcohol consumption in the night before surgery may influence on a patient's hemostasis. This study was designed to investigate the effects of wine intake the night before surgery on platelet aggregation and thromboelastogram in healthy volunteers. Twenty-four healthy subjects participated in this randomized crossover study. Each subject drank either a half bottle (300-350 ml, approximately two glasses) of red or white wine during dinner on two separate occasions. Blood samples were taken on the morning of the scheduled wine consumption and at the same time on the morning after the wine consumption. Platelet counts, and thromboelastogram (TEG) were performed and platelet function was assessed by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen induced platelet aggregation tests. There were no significant changes in platelet number, platelet function and TEG values the morning after wine consumption, and there were no significant differences in platelet number, platelet function and TEG values between red and white wine. This study indicates that an intake of red or white wine during dinner does not affect platelet number, platelet function, or viscoelastic properties of blood the next morning. A half bottle of red or white wine intake prior to a next day's elective surgery has no significant risk of suppression of coagulation function."

CD010438,0,20209597,0,Perioperative coagulation profile in living liver donors as assessed by rotational thromboelastometry.,"Transient postoperative coagulation abnormalities frequently occur in living liver donors, particularly after right liver resection. Usually, this coagulopathy is diagnosed by alterations in conventional coagulation tests (CCTs) such as the international normalized ratio (INR) of the prothrombin time. However, recent studies using other methods of coagulation monitoring have suggested that postoperative hypercoagulability may also occur in living donors. The rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) system is a coagulation monitor based on the viscoelastic properties of blood. The use of ROTEM for perioperative coagulation monitoring in the setting of living liver donors has not been reported. We evaluated the perioperative coagulation profile as assessed by ROTEM in 16 consecutive donors who underwent either right or left liver resection at our institution. ROTEM analysis and CCTs were performed at the baseline (before skin incision) and on postoperative days 1 and 3. According to the CCTs, hypocoagulability was revealed in all but 1 (left liver) donor. The INR was highest on postoperative day 1 [median = 1.67 (interquartile range = 1.37-1.8)]. In contrast, all donors had a normal coagulation profile as assessed by the ROTEM system throughout the study period. In conclusion, this study showed the disagreement between the CCTs and the ROTEM system, as no significant coagulation abnormalities could be revealed with the latter method during the study period. Further studies are needed to confirm the role of the ROTEM system as a perioperative coagulation monitor in this setting and ultimately its influence on the outcome of living donors."
CD010438,0,20150854,0,Thrombelastography in the surgical patient.,"Coagulopathy in surgical patients is an important factor in triggering major perioperative complications, i.e., intra- or postoperative bleeding and thrombo-embolic events associated with an increased mortality and morbidity. Different methods exist to assess the coagulation status of patients before, during and after surgery. Routine coagulation tests have long been considered to be the clinical standard. However, these tests have considerable limitations. Information regarding the kinetics of clot formation, clot strength, interaction of the coagulation components, platelet function and fibrinolysis is not available. Moreover, there is an important delay in obtaining test results. In contrast, thrombelastography and thrombelastometry, which both measure the visco-elastic properties of whole blood, allow the dynamic assessment of a developing clot, from fibrin formation to clot strengthening and clot lysis. Both techniques are increasingly being used in daily clinical practice in order to detect perioperative coagulopathy and to guide predominantly pro-coagulant therapy in different settings. This article provides an overview of both techniques, thrombelastography (TEG) and thrombelastometry (ROTEM), and their field of perioperative application considering of recently published data."
CD010438,0,19816205,0,Effect of the combination of mannitol and ringer acetate or hydroxyethyl starch on whole blood coagulation in vitro.,"Mannitol is administered to decrease the intracranial pressure and to improve surgical conditions during craniotomy. Simultaneously a crystalloid infusion is always given and sometimes hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is indicated for intravascular volume replacement. As normal coagulation profile is required during craniotomy, we aimed at determining the effect of mannitol with or without HES or Ringer acetate on blood coagulation in this randomized cross-over in vitro study. Blood samples were withdrawn from 10 volunteers. From whole blood we prepared 10 vol.% and 20 vol.% dilutions of mannitol (15% Mannitol) alone, mannitol and Ringer acetate, and mannitol and HES 130/0.4 (Voluven) at a ratio of 1:1. Blood samples were analyzed by modified thromboelastometry. Coagulation parameters: clotting time, clot formation time, and maximum clot firmness (MCF), were registered. Clot formation time was prolonged in all dilutions compared with control (P<0.05). MCF decreased in all dilutions compared with control (P<0.05). MCF in 20 vol.% dilution of mannitol with HES was lower than MCF in the corresponding dilution with Ringer acetate (P<0.05). Fibrinogen-dependent MCF in 10 vol.% dilution of mannitol with HES was lower than MCF in the corresponding dilution with Ringer acetate (P<0.05). We conclude that mannitol in combination with HES 130/0.4 impairs clot propagation and clot strength in vitro. Fibrin clot strength impairment is more pronounced when mannitol is combined with HES than Ringer acetate. Our findings indicate that HES in combination with mannitol should be avoided whenever a disturbance in hemostasis is suspected during craniotomy."

The patients were randomized into four groups, 30 patients per group: Group I = epidural fentanyl (EF), 10 micrograms/mL in saline; Group II = EF with 0.1% bupivacaine; Group III = EF with 0.15% bupivacaine; and Group IV = EF with 0.2% bupivacaine. Pain relief was evaluated by a visual analog scale (VAS), both at rest and during coughing, and by a visual rating scale (VRS). The VAS, VRS, degree of sedation, and side effects (nausea, vomiting, and pruritus) were evaluated every 2 h from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, for 24 h after surgery. Forced vital capacities (FVCs) were determined before surgery and at 24 h after surgery. Blood was withdrawn for thrombelastography (TEG) measurements preoperatively, in the recovery room (PARR), and 24 h postoperatively. The VAS, VRS, sedation scores, changes in postoperative FVCs, and the incidence of side effects were not statistically different among the four groups. The 24-h total volumes of infusion in the four groups (146 +/- 40 mL, 140 +/- 38 mL, 142 +/- 40 mL, 124 +/- 21 mL, respectively) were not statistically different from each other. There were no significant differences in the TEG values [reaction time (R), coagulation time (K), angle (alpha), and maximum amplitude (mA)] among the four groups at anytime nor was there any difference between the baseline, PARR, and 24-h TEG values within any group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010438,0,20229682,0,The role of rotational thromboelastometry in real time assessment of haemostasis in surgical settings.,"In the settings of trauma, liver transplantation and major surgery multifactorial coagulopathies are frequently encountered. The treatment of acutely bleeding patients is critically compromised by monitoring with standard available routine coagulation tests. In contrast to conventional tests, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) provides an automated measurement of interactive dynamic haemostatic processes in whole blood starting with initial haemostasis up to and including fibrinolysis at a given time point. Especially fibrinogen, platelet dysfunction and hyperfibrinolysis pose diagnostic gaps. The aim of this report was to highlight the usefulness of ROTEM in making the correct diagnosis and adoption of therapeutic approaches in a timely manner in liver transplantation and trauma. We describe the value of ROTEM in two haemostatically compromised patients."
CD010438,0,20229685,0,Platelet function tests and resistance to antiplatelet therapy.,"The clinical efficacy of antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, P2Y12 and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists) to prevent occlusive arterial events in patients with atherothrombotic disease is well established. Despite the proven benefits of antiplatelet therapy, many patients continue to experience arterial events. Many factors may influence the response of platelets to antiplatelet therapy and some patients with adequate compliance to the treatment may exhibit failure of platelet inhibition as determined by ex vivo laboratory tests, a phenomenon termed ""resistance"" to antiplatelet therapy. Platelet function can be measured by numerous platelet function tests, with which various parameters of platelet activation, secretion, adhesion and aggregation can be determined. These tests include light transmission (optical) and whole blood aggregometry, point-of-care devices, such as platelet function analyzers PFA-100, and VerifyNow, flow cytometry, serum thromboxane B2 and urinary levels of the thromboxane B2 metabolite 11-dehyro-thromboxane B2. Other tests, such as whole blood platelet aggregation measured by platelet counting, thrombelastography and devices such as the cone and plate(let) analyzer, Plateletworks and thrombotic status analyzer have also been used to determine platelet inhibition by antiplatelet drugs, but their use is not widespread and therefore experience is limited. Further studies need to be carried out to answer basic questions on the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of laboratory monitoring of antiplatelet therapy before it can be recommended in clinical practice."

CD010438,0,7676776,0,Leucocyte content in blood processed by autotransfusion devices during open-heart surgery.,"Autologous red blood cells processed by autotransfusion devices have become increasingly common in major surgery. The finished product, however, often contains varying amounts of leucocytes. We compared leucocyte and their differential counts of blood processed by three autotransfusion devices (Haemonetics Cell Saver IV, Dideco Stat and Dideco Stat-P) during open-heart operations on 25 patients. In addition, a zymosan-induced, luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence method was used to evaluate the activity of neutrophils in prepared autologous blood. High leucocyte counts (3.6-10.9 x 10(9)l-1) were found in all saved red blood cell concentrates. The leucocyte counts of autologous blood produced by the Haemonetics device were lowest (P < 0.01) and about one third of the patients' haematocrit-corrected counts. The proportions of neutrophils were higher in salvaged blood than in the blood circulation before anaesthesia or before retransfusion (P < 0.01). However, no general activation of neutrophils was seen, but the increase in chemiluminescence activity of about 30% that was seen in four patients may suggest an increased risk of reperfusion injury in such patients after aortic declamping. In conclusion, all three autotransfusion devices left leucocytes in the processed red blood cell concentrates, although great differences occurred between the devices."
CD010438,0,8589293,0,Thromboelastography for the prediction of bleeding after transplant renal biopsy.,"The ability of prebiopsy coagulation assays to predict mild postbiopsy bleeding was evaluated in renal transplant patients undergoing renal allograft biopsy (N = 120). The coagulation assays studied included the bleeding time, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, and thromboelastograph (TEG). Coagulation results were defined as abnormal if they fell outside the established normal reference range. Bleeding was defined as a drop in the hematocrit equal to or more than 4 points 6 h after the procedure or ultrasound evidence of a new perirenal hematoma. Overall, 21% of patients showed evidence of mild bleeding. Of those who bled, 78% had normal results on all coagulation tests, indicating that most mild bleeding was not associated with coagulation abnormalities. Of the assays tested, only abnormal TEG:angle (P < 0.01) and TEG:k (P < 0.04) values were associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Bleeding times were not predictive of an increased risk of postbiopsy bleeding; five patients had abnormal bleeding times ranging from 10 to 20 min of whom only one bled. All prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count abnormalities were mild (e.g., no prothrombin times longer than 15 s, no platelet counts below 129,000/microL); none of these assays predicted postbiopsy bleeding. Other clinical characteristics, including patient age, sex, serum creatinine, blood pressure (if less than 160/90 mm Hg), number of biopsy passes, or renal pathology, did not appear to influence bleeding after biopsy. It was concluded that most bleeding after transplant renal biopsy was not associated with coagulation abnormalities and that the TEG was the best assay for detecting mild coagulation abnormalities associated with an increased risk of bleeding."

Five adult patients (four AML, one ALL) entered the study, each patient underwent two series of three leukapheresis, the first following induction chemotherapy and the second following the first course of consolidation. The first leukapheresis of each series was done when the white blood cell count reached 10(9)/l with subsequent leukapheresis every other day. Folinic acid (Lederle Laboratories, France) was administered at a dose of 50 mg (i.v.) per day, 15 days from initiation of chemotherapy and continuing through the third leukapheresis of the series (days 25-30). PBSC were collected on a Haemonetics V50 cell separator. In these five cases we observed an increased yield of both colony-forming units, granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) and burst forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) expressed per ml of cytapheresis product: CFU-GM x 18, BFU-E x 3 and if expressed per 10(4)/kg of body weight: CFU-GM x 30, BFU-E x 3 (CFU-GM P less than 0.05, BFU-E less than 0.01). Long-term blood culture (LTSC) from FA stimulated leukapheresis, in an attempt to quantitate the most primitive stem cells, demonstrated that this expansion of the PBSC was sustained in time. We found by means of LTSC that FA did not stimulate CFU-L from patients with AML (two cases tested). Finally two AML patients were grafted with FA-PBSC after Cytotoxan and total body irradiation (TBI). Haematopoietic reconstitution was rapid complete and sustained in time in both patients. This indication for folinic acid should be further studied with or as an alternative to haematopoietic growth factors."

We evaluated whole blood (WB) rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in parahaemophilia patients and the contribution of intraplatelets FV, if any, to clot formation. Standard ROTEM(®) assays were performed in WB from nine parahaemophilia patients and 50 healthy controls. In addition, platelets poor plasma from one parahaemophilia patient (PPP-Pt) or normal subjects (PPP-N) was reconstituted with washed platelets obtained either from one patient with parahaemophilia (Plts-Pt) or normal subjects (Plts-N) and ROTEM assays were performed in platelets rich plasma (PRP) samples. There was a prolongation of the WB clotting time (CT) in all assays in patients as compared with controls. However, maximum clot firmness (MCF) was similar in patients and controls. ROTEM in PPP-Pt showed both a prolongation of CT and a reduction of MCF as compared with PPP-N. The addition of either Plts-Pt or Plts-N to PPP-Pt resulted in similar increase in MCF and a decrease of CT which was more evident for PPP-Pt + Plts-N than PPP-Pt + Plts-Pt. In contrast, the addition of Plts-Pt or Plts-N to PPP-N had superimposable effects on both CT and MCF. In parahaemophilia patients, WB ROTEM(®) presents mainly with prolongation of CT and no relevant effect on MCF. Residual intraplatelets FV in parahaemophilia contributes significantly to thrombin generation as shown in artificially reconstituted PRP models."
CD010438,0,18059338,0,p38 MAPK plays an essential role in apoptosis induced by photoactivation of a novel ethylene glycol porphyrin derivative.,"In this study, we provide evidence that photostimulation of various cancer cells preloaded with a new photosensitizing compound, tetrakis-meso-(4-ethyleneglycol-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl) porphyrin (PORF-TEG), results in rapid activation of the cell death machinery. PORF-TEG, although primarily localized in lysosomes, induces mitochondria-driven apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis is accompanied by immediate and sustained activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and transient activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Conversely, the inhibition of p38 by PD 169316 or SB202190 and by the p38alpha dominant-negative mutant as well as the deletion of the p38alpha gene (MEFs-KO) protected cells from apoptosis, whereas inhibition of JNK did not. Activation of the p38 signaling pathway occurs upstream of caspase activation. In addition, preincubation of cells with scavengers of reactive oxygen species attenuated p38 and caspase activation and increased cell survival, thus connecting reactive oxygen species formation with the activation of the p38 pathway. Later events included degradation of Bcl-2, activation of tBid, and cleavage of Bad and Mcl-1. The data suggest a key role for p38 MAPK in PORF-TEG-photoinduced apoptosis."
CD010438,0,22713683,0,Does rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) improve prediction of bleeding after cardiac surgery?,"Coagulopathy and massive bleeding are severe complications of cardiac surgery, particularly in procedures requiring prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). There is huge variability in transfusion practices across hospitals and providers in cross-sectional studies. This variability may indicate unguided decision-making, perhaps attributable to lack of reliable, predictive laboratory testing of coagulopathy to guide transfusion practice. Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) measures multiple coagulation parameters and may provide value from its ease of use, rapid results, and measurement of several steps in the coagulation pathway. Yet, the predictive value and utility of ROTEM remains unclear. In this study, we investigated ROTEM's predictive value for chest tube drainage after cardiac surgery."

CD010438,0,22185951,0,Impact of cell salvage during cardiac surgery on the thrombelastomeric coagulation profile: a pilot study.,"Intraoperative cell salvage of the cardiopulmonary bypass residual volume can dilute platelets and coagulation factors. This is a report of a randomised control trial of 20 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Residual cardiopulmonary bypass volume was processed and transfused after surgery in the cell salvage group and the residual volume was transfused unprocessed in the control group. The coagulation profile was measured using the Rotem(®) thrombelastometry system. Mean (SD) maximum clot firmness after surgery was 52.8 (5.4) mm in the cell salvage group compared to 57.2 (5.0) mm in the control group (p=0.04). Clot formation time was prolonged after surgery by 39 (27) s in the cell saver group compared to 19 (17) s in the control group (p=0.045). Platelet count was reduced after surgery by 96 (32) x 10(9).L(-1) in the cell saver group and 70 (19) x 10(9).L(-1) in the control group (p=0.03). Blood volume in the chest drains 4 hours after surgery was similar in both groups. There was a strong association between clot formation time after surgery and blood loss (R = 0.68, p=0.001). The increase in blood loss was 4.1 ml for every one-second increase in clot formation time (95% CI 1.9 - 6.4, p=0.001). Cell salvage of the residual cardiopulmonary bypass volume reduced platelet numbers and prolonged clot formation time and maximum clot firmness was less in this group."

Results of a retrospective multicenter study.,"On the basis of a survey, the acute side-effects and technical problems in a total of 77,525 cytaphereses (IFC 36,530, CFC 40,995) in donors at 39 hemapheresis centers were retrospectively analysed statistically. In general, relevant donor side-effects (0.78%-1.05%) were more rare than the primary donor-independent disturbances (1.65%-2.63%). The donor side-effects predominated merely with the use of the cell separators Haemonetics M30/Belco (1.06% vs. 0.57%). These were mainly circulatory reactions (0.83%), which were generally much more frequent with IFC (0.54%) than with CFC (IBM/Cobe 0.11%, CS-3000 0.19%). Potentially fatal complications were not reported. The frequency of side-effects, disturbances and discontinuations correlated inversely with the separation rate of the individual centers per method. Centers in which two or three methods were applied simultaneously reported a higher frequency of side-effects and disturbances. Hemolysis was only observed with IFC (0.09%), but not with the use of the Haemonetics V50. The greater susceptibility to disturbances of technical/methodological/operational origin essentially results from the more elaborate, but not yet perfected technology, including computer control and monitoring, as well as defects in the production of the much more complicated disposable sets. Thus the highest rate of discontinuations was calculated for the system which is so far the most sophisticated technically (CS-3000, 1.85%). Although the primary donor-independent problems sometimes correlate directly with the manifestation of donor side-effects, the greater technological sophistication of automatically controlled and monitored systems cannot be dispensed with, since only in this way can potentially fatal risks for the donors be largely ruled out.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The results showed that the crude extract of AP could inhibit significantly one-phase and two-phase platelet aggregation induced by ADP (P less than 0.001, 0.01). The potency of AP crude extract seemed to be somewhat stronger than Ligustrazine and Persantin injection in vitro, but the difference was not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). A dose-effect relationship of AP was demonstrated also (r = 0.93). The rapid effect of this drug on platelet aggregation in vivo suggested that AP could be absorbed quickly, but the effect lasted for only a short time. 12 hours after with-drawing of AP, the 1 minute and 5 minutes aggregation rates increased by 18.67%, 36.63% respectively, as compared with the lowest aggregation rate after administration. The activating effect of AP on fibrinolysis was also detected by shortened euglobulinlysis time (211.50 vs 182.50 min in vitro, 219.38 vs 149.38 min in vivo, P less than 0.001). In addition, the influence of AP upon coagulation and thrombelastogram was determined. This study suggested that AP in a promising antithrombogenic agent.

Healthy full-term parturients received either 500 ml 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (HES, n = 25) or 500 ml 4% succinylated gelatine (GEL, n = 25) prior to spinal anaesthesia. TEG parameters including reaction time (r-time), clot formation time (k-time), clot formation rate (α-angle) and maximum amplitude (MA) were measured immediately before and after pre-loading. Both groups had significantly shorter r-time and lower MA after pre-loading. The α-angle was significantly decreased after pre-loading with HES but not with GEL. No significant differences in k-time were induced pre-loading. In conclusion, pre-loading with HES or GEL was associated with a mild hypocoagulable effect in healthy parturients presenting for elective caesarean section; however, all TEG parameters in both groups remained within or very close to the normal range after pre-loading."

A reliable method to evaluate hypercoagulability is thromboelastography (TEG), but this has not so far been used to investigate sepsis-induced hypercoagulability. Antithrombin (AT) in plasma of septic patients is decreased, and administration of AT may therefore reduce the acquired hypercoagulability.

The effects of UFH, LMWH and DPD on standard TEG parameters were compared with the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time and anti-activated factor X (anti-FXa) activity, at concentrations of these anticoagulants ranging from 0.025 to 1 U/ml. In the second part of the study, the effects of very low concentrations (0.005-0.05 U/ml) of UFH, LMWH and DPD on the difference between standard and heparinase-modified TEG parameters were compared with the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time and anti-FXa activity. Standard TEG parameters were outside the reference range at lower concentrations of UFH, LMWH and DPD than most conventional coagulation assays were able to detect. Only anti-FXa activity was more sensitive to the presence of these anticoagulants than the standard TEG alone. The lowest concentration of UFH, LMWH and DPD used in this study (0.005 U/ml) caused significant differences between the standard and heparinase-modified alpha-angles of the TEG. In addition, the difference between standard and heparinase-modified TEG parameters distinguished between low concentrations (0.005-0.05 U/ml) of UFH with greater sensitivity than anti-FXa activity, but were less sensitive to LMWH and DPD. The standard TEG is more sensitive to UFH, LMWH and DPD than most conventional coagulation tests, with the exception of anti-FXa activity. Calculation of the difference between standard and heparinase-modified TEG parameters greatly increases the sensitivity of the assay for the effects of these anticoagulants, and is more sensitive to very low quantities of UFH than anti-FXa activity."

CD010438,0,10843240,0,A prospective study of thromboelastography (TEG) and filter life during continuous veno-venous hemofiltration.,"Anticoagulants are commonly used to prolong circuit life during continuous hemofiltration. However, a clear correlation between routinely performed blood coagulability tests and circuit life has not been demonstrated. This lack of correlation may derive from the limited ability of such tests to describe the likelihood of in vivo clotting. We hypothesized that thromboelastography (TEG), which derives its variables from a closer reproduction of in vivo coagulation, would significantly correlate with filter life. Accordingly, we conducted a prospective pilot study of the correlation between filter life and TEG-derived variables in 21 hemofilters used in 6 critically ill patients admitted to a tertiary intensive care unit. It involved the performance of TEG during steady state anticoagulation, measurement of circuit life, and of routine coagulation variables. The results showed that the mean circuit life was 20.7+/-4.0 h despite an average aPTT of 67.7+/-12.8 s and a mean heparin dose of 472.5+/-96.2 IU/h. The mean INR was 1.4+/-1 and the mean platelet count was 118+/-16 x 10(3)/mm3. Although several TEG variables correlated with heparin dose (p < 0.03), no correlation was found between any of the routine coagulation variables or any of the TEG variables and circuit life. In conclusion, no significant correlation between TEG derived variables or routinely measured coagulation variables and circuit life could be demonstrated. These findings suggest that such tests are not useful indicators of circuit anticoagulation adequacy and that factors other than blood coagulability may play a role in circuit failure."

Unsoluble gastric mucus accelerated hemostasis even more after stimulation by secretin-pancreozymin, as evidenced by thrombelastographic recordings. Gastric juice of patients with duodenal ulcers showed a significant change of these parameters to the opposite after pentagastrin.

For this reason, we studied the influence of magnesium sulphate (in vitro 2-16 mVal/l) on thromboelastogram, spontaneous and ADP-induced thrombocyte aggregation, prostacyclin sensitivity of the thrombocytes and prostacyclin liberation from umbilical cord vessel preparations. The thromboelastogram showed an inhibitory influence of magnesium sulphate on all measurement parameters. Spontaneous and ADP-induced thrombocyte aggregation were inhibited to a statistically significant extent. The prostacyclin sensibility of the thrombocytes was increased by magnesium-sulphate. Magnesium sulphate enhanced prostacyclin liberation from the vascular wall significantly by 20-36%. It is possible that in gestosis magnesium sulphate may exercise a favourable influence on the disturbed balance between prostacyclin production and prostacyclin sensibility of the thrombocytes by exercising an influence on coagulation, thrombocyte function and prostacyclin liberation, and that it can thus contribute towards stabilising coagulation disturbances."
CD010438,0,9691864,0,In vivo investigation into the effects of haemodilution with hydroxyethyl starch (200/0.5) and normal saline on coagulation.,"We have investigated the effects of haemodilution with either saline or hydroxyethyl starch (200/0.5) (HES) on blood coagulation in healthy volunteers in vivo. Standard haematological tests (packed cell volume (PCV), platelets, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, antithrombin III, bleeding time and platelet aggregation), and thrombelastography (TEG) were performed before and after administration of either 0.9% saline 1000 ml or HES 1000 ml i.v. over a 30-min period. Dilution of PCV and platelet concentrations as a result of volume load were 9% in the saline group and 19% in the HES group. Reductions in fibrinogen (18.6% and 28.8%) and antithrombin III (25.5% and 37.8%) were significantly greater than could be explained by haemodilution alone in both groups. Indices of platelet aggregation were significantly enhanced by saline haemodilution, but not by HES, which inhibited epinephrine-induced aggregation and prolonged bleeding time. TEG in the saline group showed significantly shortened r and k times (24% and 26%, respectively), and increased alpha angle (24%) and maximum amplitude (MA, 6%). HES haemodilution decreased MA (11%) but did not affect other TEG variables. We conclude that haemodilution of normal blood exerted a procoagulant effect, possibly by enhancement of thrombin formation. Circulating concentrations of antithrombin III were depleted more than could be explained by haemodilution alone, leading to a hypercoagulable state. This effect was offset by an antiplatelet action of HES, which was not seen with saline. The mechanism is unknown."

CD010438,0,7689759,0,Changes in urokinase-type plasminogen activator in orthotopic liver transplantation.,"Elevated levels of u-PA Ag and scu-PA preoperatively and before revascularization of the graft are explained by an impaired clearance function by the diseased liver. They are parallel preoperatively and in the beginning of OLT by increased tcu-PA activity. This may reflect a role of the intrinsic fibrinolytic system in the ""hyperfibrinolytic state"" observed in patients with end stage liver disease. u-PA Ag and scu-PA normalize following reperfusion. The increase in tcu-PA observed during the anhepatic phase coincided with greatly increased fibrinolysis, as demonstrated by thrombelastography. This indicates that u-PA seems to be involved in the development of fibrinolysis during OLT. It had been demonstrated in previous investigations that a significant increase of t-PA activity was seen in the late anhepatic phase leading to an elevated plasmin generation. Since plasmin is a major activator of scu-PA, a t-PA mediated scu-PA activation would explain the concomitant increase in both plasminogen activators."

CD010438,0,7689752,0,Influence of prostaglandin E1 infusion on hemostasis in orthotopic liver transplantation.,"In the control group, a significant decrease in platelet aggregability could be demonstrated after reperfusion. This was paralleled by a decrease in platelet counts. When PGE1 was infused during OLT, the post-reperfusional decreases in platelet aggregability and platelet counts in the control group could be prevented. Furthermore, our investigation demonstrated that PGE1 infusion led to higher t-PA activity during the anhepatic phase. This was paralleled and followed by lower alpha 2AP levels at the end of the anhepatic phase and after reperfusion. The higher t-PA levels in the PG group did not result in clinical signs of hyperfibrinolysis during OLT. The aprotinin administration in both groups is most certainly responsible for the absence of hyperfibrinolytic signs in the TEG and the low overall requirement for transfusions, explaining the comparable transfusion rate in the two groups (Fig. 5). Further investigations involving more patients are required to evaluate the clinical effect of PGE1 therapy."

It was found that similar conditions of emotional stress cause three types of reactions in different people: functional hypercoagulation, functional hypocoagulation and the absence of any noticeable reaction according to the findings of thrombelastography. The degree of activation of the blood fibrinolytic system depends on the extent of involvement of the patients in interpersonality relationships. Patients with hypertensive disease are characterized by neuroticism, heightened level of anxiety and dependence, and increased emotional aggressiveness. Signs of introversion also prevailed in these patients, which was attributed to the forced formation of new behavior models due to the disease."

CD010438,0,10458035,0,[State of the hemostasis and fibrinolysis systems in cesarean section under combined ketamine anesthesia].,"The reserve potentialities of the hemostasis and fibrinolysis systems were studied by thromboelastography in 34 women with normal pregnancy aged 18-34 years at different stages of cesarean section under combined ketamine anesthesia. Three types of responses were observed: compensated, subcompensated, and decompensated. In women with subcompensated response removal of the fetus from the uterus involved in 30.1% cases depletion of the reserve potential of anticoagulant mechanisms, which led to abnormal blood loss in 34.7% cases."
CD010438,0,18160593,0,Homocysteine activates platelets in vitro.,"The mechanism of thrombogenicity in hyperhomocysteinemia remains controversial. The authors investigated the association between elevated plasma homocysteine levels, platelet function, and blood coagulation. Blood was collected from healthy subjects and patients with critical limb ischemia. Basal platelet counts and platelet aggregation as well as flow cytometry were performed to assess spontaneous- and agonist-induced platelet aggregation as well as P-selectin and Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa expression at different homocysteine concentrations. Thromboelastography was performed, and platelet shape change was assessed, using a channelyzer, by measuring median platelet volume. Lactate dehydrogenase was measured, to indirectly assess red blood cell membrane integrity, after homocysteine exposure. The study results suggest that platelet activation and hypercoagulability occur after exposure to homocysteine, especially in patients with critical limb ischemia. Homocysteine concentrations of approximately 50 micromol/L appear to be the level at which these changes occur in vitro, and this effect on platelets appears to be indirect."
CD010438,0,10831919,0,The role of in process qualification in quality improvement of the haemonetics MCS plus leucodepleted platelet concentrate.,"With the implementation of universal leucodepletion in UK all leucodepletion processes have gone through a standard process qualification and quality improvement. The Haemonetics MCS system is a well established automated platelet collection system for the production of double dose leucoreduced platelet concentrate (WBC approximately 70x10(6)/dose). Recently an automated post collection filtration harness system has been introduced (MCS plus LDP) in which platelets are filtered, using an in-line PALL polyester filter (LRFH6 PALL) to reduce the WBC level to below 5x10(6) WBC/dose. This system passed our Phase I evaluation process based on 20-40 runs. However, some changes in the final volume of the products were needed to conform to national guidelines. Large scale trials using the new volume adjusted protocol revealed occasional failure in the leucocyte content. Therefore, 100% testing had to be implemented on all products. A national evaluation was carried out to determine whether changing the filter to a more efficacious one, the LRFXL (PALL) or slowing the filtration flow rate can influence the overall outcome. To reduce donor variability, known donor population were used with identical apheresis conditions. A more consistent and systematic drop in leucocyte content was observed by reducing the flow rate whereas a similar failure (i.e. 1-3%) rate was found both in controls and LRFXL when using the standard head pressure, which is recommended by the manufacturer. A similar failure rate was found using three different low leucocyte counting technologies (Nageotte, flow cytometry and Imagn 2000). It is recommended that a process qualification/validation program should be implemented when even a small modification in the collection system is introduced."

Thermal analysis showed that the niclosamide solvates were extremely unstable in a PVP-vehicle and rapidly changed to monohydrated crystals. A suspension in propylene glycol was more stable and TG analysis showed that crystal transformation was less rapid. In this vehicle, the crystals transformed to the anhydrate, rather than the monohydrate, since the vehicle was non-aqueous. The TEG-hemisolvate was the most stable in suspension and offered the best possibility of commercial exploitation."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate three commercially available cell saver (CS) devices in terms of erythrocyte function and the quality of washed RBCs during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Thirty patients undergoing CPB were randomly allocated to three CS devices: Group C (Cell Saver 5+; Haemonetics, n = 10), Group M (autolog; Medtronic, n = 10), and Group F (CATS; Fresenius HemoCare, n = 10). Blood samples were collected from reservoirs and transfusion bags. Reservoirs and washed RBCs were analyzed for erythrocyte aggregation index, deformation index (DI) and hematocrit viscosity, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), free Hb removal (ΔfHb), glucose (Glu), lactate (Lac), and blood urea nitrogen. After processing, Groups C (P = 0.026) and M (P = 0.032) had relatively higher erythrocyte DI compared with Group F. Group C had lower Δ2,3-DPG compared with Groups M (P = 0.001) and F (P = 0.001). Group F provided the maximum concentration of Hct (P = 0.021; 0.046) and Hb (P = 0.008; 0.013). In addition, Groups C (P = 0.035) and M (P = 0.038) had a higher removal of fHb (ΔfHb), differing significantly with Group F. In conclusion, CS devices use the same theory of centrifugation; however, based on different designs, the function of the washed erythrocyte and undesirable content removal efficiency differs widely from one device to another."

Although rFVIIa is effective at stopping bleeding, a reliable assay to monitor its effect is lacking. To characterize the pharmacokinetics and global coagulation effects of rFVIIa for 6 h following a IV dose of 90 μg kg⁻¹. Ten non-bleeding subjects with severe FVIII or FIX deficiency were infused with a single-dose of rFVIIa 90 μg k⁻¹ body weight and blood was collected before and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h postdose. Global haemostasis was characterized throughout the study utilizing whole blood analyses (Hemodyne HAS, TEG, ROTEM). The clearance and half-life of factor FVII:C was estimated as 39.0 ± 8.8 mL h⁻¹ kg⁻¹ and 2.1 ± 0.2 h respectively. There was good inter-assay agreement with respect to clot initiation parameters (R, CT and FOT) and these parameters all fell to a mean of approximately 9 min following rFVIIa dosing. The platelet contractile force (PCF) and clot elastic modulus (CEM) were positively correlated to FVII:C (P < 0.0001), and these parameters were dynamic throughout the 6-h period. The MA and MCF did not correlate to FVII:C nor did they significantly change during the study. Prothrombin F1 + 2 significantly increased following rFVIIa dosing (P < 0.001), but remained steady throughout the study. There was no change in D-dimer concentrations over time. The FOT, R and CT characterized clot initiation following rFVIIa dosing. The PCF and CEM were correlated to FVII:C and characterized the dynamics of platelet function and clot strength over the rFVIIa dosing interval. The clinical significance of these findings needs additional study."

CD010438,0,21873363,0,Characterization of in vitro hemostatic peptide effects by thromboelastography.,"In this study, we validated a thromboelastography (TEG) method to evaluate the hemostatic effects of 3 peptides. The first peptide is an ideal amphipathic peptide composed of 22 leucine and lysine in a ratio of 2:1. At a very low concentration, the peptide had a procoagulant effect shown by decreases in reaction time (R) and coagulation time (K) but was impaired by a decrease in maximum amplitude (MA). At higher concentrations, the peptide had an anticoagulant effect. The α angle was minimally affected by the peptide. The second peptide is melittin derived from bee venom. Melittin showed procoagulant effects reflected by a decrease in clotting time but led to lower MA. The third peptide derived from fibrinogen γ chain promoted hemostasis only at an optimal concentration and became anticoagulant at a higher concentration. The hemostatic mechanisms of each peptide were discussed. Our study would facilitate further development of peptides for either hemorrhage control or thrombosis treatment."

Hemostasis is affected by CO interactions with key heme-modulated molecules. We wished to determine whether freezing would affect CO-mediated changes in coagulation/fibrinolysis in plasma in anticipation of collecting samples both within our institution and from collaborating centers. Plasma was exposed to CO by addition of 0-100 μmol/l tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer, with a portion of plasma immediately frozen at -80 °C. Unfrozen plasma was subjected to thrombelastographic analysis following tissue factor activation, with some samples exposed to tissue type plasminogen activator. Frozen plasma was subsequently thawed and similarly analyzed. Freezing did not significantly change CO-mediated enhancement of coagulation or attenuation of fibrinolysis. Hemostatic changes in plasma exposed to CO are not affected by a freeze-thaw cycle, which will permit local batch processing of samples and transport of samples on dry ice from collaborating centers."

CD010438,0,3354830,0,[The effect of intraoperative autotransfusion on the oxygen affinity of erythrocytes].,"Intraoperative autotransfusion provides several advantages over homologous transfusion for the recipient. Since the harvested red cells have a normal 2,3-DPG concentration [15, 18], the decreased oxygen affinity of hemoglobin [26] that occurs in the recipient after the transfusion of stored blood is thought to be avoidable by intraoperative autotransfusion. In a study on the influence of harvested cells on oxygen affinity in patients by Orr and Blenko [18], however, it was not possible to demonstrate the superiority of these erythrocytes over stored red cells in the recipient: whereas 2,3-DPG remained at the preoperative level in both groups after transfusion, oxygen affinity increased postoperatively in the study group but not in the control group. In this study we directly determined oxygen affinity in addition to 2,3-DPG in the harvested cells after processing. The influence on the recipients' oxygen affinity after transfusion was analyzed and compared to that of a group of patients who received only stored blood."

The structure of the nocturnal sleep was studied by polygraphic recording; the authors also studied the circadian rhythm of the clotting properties of blood, pulse blood filling of the cerebral vessels and arterial pressure. It was found that the structure of dream in patients with a history of a ""nocturnal"" stroke was characterized by an increase in the activity of the mechanisms responsible for the phase of rapid sleep. Characteristic features of the circadian dynamics of the hemostatic system and hemodynamic parameters in patients with a history of a ""diurnal"" and ""nocturnal"" stroke were identified.

PP4 which turned out to be identical with a vascular anticoagulant of the annexin type, inhibits the blood clotting process by binding of the essential lipids in a reaction which is dependent on calcium ions. Also in the presence of calcium PP4 combines with platelet membranes neutralizing their procoagulant effect. By fluorescence-microscopy binding of PP4 to stimulated macrophages is shown. The antithrombotic effect of PP4 is demonstrated by means of thrombelastography of human blood. Coagulation triggered by the addition of thromboplastin/lipid-mixtures is extinguished by PP4."

This predicted glycopeptide gene cluster contains three closely related sulfotransferases (Teg12, -13, and -14) that sulfate teicoplanin-like glycopeptides at three unique sites. Here we report a series of structures: an apo structure of Teg12, Teg12 bound to the desulfated cosubstrate 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate, and Teg12 bound to the teicoplanin aglycone. Teg12 appears to undergo a series of significant conformational rearrangements during glycopeptide recruitment, binding, and catalysis. Loop regions that exhibit the most conformational flexibility show the least sequence conservation between TEG sulfotransferases. Site-directed mutagenesis guided by our structural studies confirmed the importance of key catalytic residues as well as the importance of residues found throughout the conformationally flexible loop regions."

CD010438,0,17973850,0,Correlation of thromboelastographic patterns with clinical presentation and rationale for use of antifibrinolytics in severe haemophilia patients.,"Thromboelastography (TEG) assesses the global pattern of blood coagulation in the whole blood. Present day management of haemophilia is based on replacement therapy with lost factor by parenteral administration of factor concentrates. It is very well known that interaction of cellular components in the blood also affect the thrombin generation which in turn might produce varied TEG patterns that might reflect the clinical severity in haemophilia patients. We evaluated 66 severe haemophilia A and B patients (as assessed by one-stage assay) by TEG and correlated the varied TEG patterns with the clinical severity in the patients. Four distinct TEG patterns were observed; Group A consisted of eight patients with hypercoagulable patterns while group B consisted of two patients showing hyperfibrinolytic patterns. Group C comprised of 17 patients whose TEG tracings did not show the initiation of clot formation at all while group D comprising of 39 patients showed varied clot initiation times ranging from almost normal pattern to a highly prolonged split times. Groups A and D patients were relatively milder clinically while groups B and C were clinically severe as assessed by the number of bleeding episodes, the frequency of transfusion and joint deformity. Subsequently we also evaluated the in vitro efficacy of the antifibrinolytic drug, EACA in normalizing the TEG patterns in 12 patients (group C) who did not show the initiation of clot formation in the TEG tracings to see the contribution of fibrinolysis in producing such patterns. The use of EACA in vitro in this group improved the TEG profile of these patients. In conclusion, the classification of severe haemophilia patients based on TEG patterns correlated well with the clinical severity and the ex vivo use of antifibrinolytics like EACA are effective in improving the TEG profile of all patients who had an abnormal TEG pattern without any clot initiation."
CD010438,0,15588086,0,Antiestrogen binding site and estrogen receptor mediate uptake and distribution of 4-hydroxytamoxifen-targeted doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate in breast cancer cells.,"The anthracycline antitumor drug, doxorubicin (DOX), has long been used as a broad spectrum chemotherapeutic. The literature now documents the role of formaldehyde in the cytotoxic mechanism, and anthracycline-formaldehyde conjugates possess substantially enhanced activity in vitro and in vivo. We have recently reported the design, synthesis, and preliminary evaluation of a doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate targeted, via 4-hydroxytamoxifen, to the estrogen receptor (ER) and antiestrogen binding site (AEBS), which are commonly present in breast cancer cells. The lead targeted doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate, called DOX-TEG-TAM, was found to possess superior cell growth inhibition characteristics relative to clinical doxorubicin and an untargeted control conjugate, especially in ER-negative, multidrug resistant MCF-7/Adr cells. The enhanced activity in the absence of estrogen receptor raised the possibility that targeting was also mediated via AEBS. Fluorescence microscopy of an ER-negative, AEBS-positive cell line as a function of time showed initial DOX-TEG-TAM localization in cytosol, in contrast to initial DOX and untargeted doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate localization in the nucleus. DOX-TEG-TAM was taken up by four AEBS-positive cell lines to a greater extent than doxorubicin and an untargeted doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate. Of the four cell lines, three were ER negative. DOX-TEG-TAM uptake was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the presence of a competing AEBS ligand. DOX-TEG-TAM retains 60% of the affinity of 4-hydroxytamoxifen for AEBS. DOX-TEG-TAM was also taken up by the AEBS-negative, ER-positive cancer cell line Rtx-6; with these cells uptake was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the ER ligand, estradiol. The data support the hypothesis that uptake of 4-hydroxytamoxifen targeted doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugate is mediated by both the antiestrogen binding site and estrogen receptor."

The purpose of the present investigation was to further define the nature of CORM-2 interaction with prothrombin and fibrinogen by exposing purified proteins to CORM-2 or generating protein concentration-response curves in the absence or presence of CORM-2. Purified prothrombin was exposed to 0 or 100 micromol/l CORM-2 prior to being added to prothrombin-deficient plasma (n=7-8 per condition). Fibrinogen-deficient plasma had fibrinogen added for a final concentration of 100-800 mg/dl and was exposed to 0 or 100 micromol/l CORM-2 (n=4 per condition). Following tissue factor activation, thrombelastographic data were collected until clot strength stabilized. Exposure of prothrombin to CORM-2 did not significantly enhance coagulation kinetics. In sharp contrast, CORM-2 exposure enhanced fibrinogen coagulation kinetics in a concentration-dependent fashion, with peak effect seen at a fibrinogen concentration of 300 mg/dl that then progressively decreased throughout the range tested. Our data demonstrate that CORM-2 does not enhance plasma coagulation kinetics by modifying prothrombin; instead, the concept that CORM-2 modifies fibrinogen is the most likely explanation for the enhanced thrombin-fibrinogen interactions observed."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of continuous ultrafiltration on e-aminocaproic acid (EACA) utilizing functional coagulation analysis. A fibrinolytic assay was developed to detect EACA using the thromboelastograph (TEG) and urokinase (0.138 units 0.360 mL(-1)). Fresh bovine blood (23 +/- 1% hematocrit) was pumped (100 mL min(-1)) through an ultrafiltrator (HPH 400) at 37 degrees C with a transmembrane pressure of 280 mmHg. EACA (0.065 mg mL(-1)) was circulated for 10 minutes before initiating ultrafiltration. Samples (pre- and postultrafiltrator) were obtained at baseline, 5, and 10 min of ultrafiltration and analyzed via the fibrinolytic assay for EACA determination. TEG profiles significantly decreased from concentrations of 0.065 mg to 0.0325 mg of EACA mL(-1) blood (maximum amplitude MA, 75.4 +/- 4.0 versus 63.3 +/- 2.9, p < .05, TEG index 5.4 +/- 0.7 versus 4.0 +/- 0.3, p < .05). Fibrinolysis at 30 min increased as EACA concentrations declined (0.065 mg, 0% versus 0.032 mg, 16.4 +/- 2.8%, p < .05). During ultrafiltration the MA increased significantly from baseline to 10 min postultrafiltrator (68.2 +/- 3.0 versus 75.8 +/- 10.0, p < .05) and from 5 min pre- to 10 min postultrafiltrator (69.7 +/- 4.2 versus 75.8 +/- 10.0, p < .05). The TEG index showed no significant change, and no fibrinolysis was detected at 30 min from any datapoint during ultrafiltration. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the antifibrinolytic properties of EACA are maintained during ultrafiltration with a 25% reduction in total circulating volume."
CD010438,0,7064601,0,[Age and changes in blood coagulation during treatment of cerebral ischemia with indirect anticoagulants].,"Using the thromboelastographic method the age peculiarities of blood coagulation changes were examined in 131 patients treated for cerebral ischemias with rapid indirect-action anticoagulants (syncumar, pelentan, phenylin). In patients under 45 years of age these anticoagulants acted upon all the blood coagulation phases during the first three days of the treatment. Their use led to a lowering of the prothrombin complex activity and fibrinogen concentration as well as to activation of the anticoagulation system. In patients aged from 45 to 59 years these anticoagulants acted substantially on phases I and II of blood coagulation only, while their action on phase III was much weaker. In the elderly age group (60 to 74 years) no effect of the drugs on phase III of blood coagulation was observed. Adverse effects of the anticoagulant therapy in the forms of hemorrhagic complications and ""pathological hypocoagulation"" were more frequent in the middle-aged and elderly groups of the patients than in the young ones (the difference being statistically significant). The elderly patients showed more pronounced reactions to discontinuation of the anticoagulant treatment. These reactions manifested in rapid and considerable progress of hypercoagulation development."

Upon placement, light-cured dental polymers may release a wide spectrum of residual compounds due to incomplete monomer-conversion during polymerization. Apart from liberating unreacted monomers, additional compound release might occur due to mechanical wear and enzymatic degradation on the salivary surface of resin fillings. Following delivery into the local bio phase, leached compounds may encounter a variety of different enzymes, which might be present in their oral or systemic environment. Metabolic by-products formerly associated with TEGDMA-degradation include triethylene glycol (TEG), methacrylic acid (MA), 2,3-epoxymethacrylic acid (2,3-EMA), and formaldehyde."
CD010438,0,2385125,0,Platelet-rich plasma reduces postoperative blood loss after cardiopulmonary bypass.,"To study the effect of plasma sequestration and reinfusion of platelet-rich plasma on blood loss after cardiopulmonary bypass, 18 patients undergoing heart operations were randomly selected either to have collected or not to have collected approximately 250 ml of platelet-rich plasma before initiating cardiopulmonary bypass with the use of the Haemonetics Plasma Saving System (Haemonetics Corporation, Braintree, Mass.). All patients had standardized anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass. After reversal of heparin, autologous platelet-rich plasma was reinfused in nine patients. Thrombocyte counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were calculated before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass, and 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. Blood loss and total number of transfusions were recorded. Although 9% of the total platelet volume was removed, there were no hemodynamic complications related to the use of the Haemonetics Plasma Saving System. In both groups, significant low levels of thrombocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were seen after cardiopulmonary bypass. Platelet-rich plasma-reinfused patients had a significantly higher number of platelets after heparin reversal. They also had significantly less blood loss after the operation, necessitating 65% less banked blood products (p less than 0.05). We concluded that reinfusion of autologous platelet-rich plasma may serve as an effective and safe way to restore some of the hematologic derangements after cardiopulmonary bypass."
CD010438,0,23032067,0,"Comparing peripheral blood stem cell collection using the COBE Spectra, Haemonetics MCS+, and Baxter Amicus.","Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) have become the most common source of hematopoietic cells for allogeneic or autologous blood and marrow transplantation (BMT). We performed an evaluation of PBSC collections using three different apheresis systems in two major transplantation centers in Singapore. Patients undergoing autologous BMT and donors collecting for allogeneic BMT were harvested using the COBE Spectra, Haemonetics MCS+, or Baxter Amicus. There were 99 Spectra collections (61 were autologous), 81 MCS+ collections (35 were autologous) and 38 Amicus collections (33 were autologous). Our data shows that the Amicus not only processed larger peripheral blood volumes but also yielded larger PBSC volume (P-value<0.05). In terms of PBSC products, the Spectra produced more WBC, WBC/liter blood processed, and WBC/kg (P-value<0.05). The Spectra and MCS+ produced comparable amount of CD34+ cells. Amicus collected 50% less platelets compared to Spectra and MCS+. The total CD34+ cells in the PBSC products was linearly correlated to the circulating CD34+ cells using Spectra, MCS+, and Amicus. Our results suggest that, compared to MCS+ and Amicus, collecting PBSC using the COBE Spectra can produce more WBC with a similar number of CD34+ cells. With a linear correlation of circulating CD34+ cells to the total CD34+ cells in the products, the availability of an automated procedure, no rotating seal, and a small extracorporeal volume, the Spectra appears to be the preferred machine for PBSC collection."

Consumption coagulopathy is almost always accompanied by dilutional coagulopathy. Formulas for calculating critical blood loss and standard coagulation tests are often not helpful in the case of massive transfusion. On the other hand, systems suitable for point of care, such as thrombelastography, have important advantages. In the case of consumption and dilutional coagulopathy plasma coagulation is disturbed and critical values are first seen for fibrinogen. Not only is fibrin polymerization impaired by the bleeding-induced loss and dilution of fibrinogen, but also by interaction with artificial colloids, particularly hydroxyethyl starch preparations. Therapy of consumption and dilutional coagulopathy calls for fresh frozen plasma. If this is not available in sufficient quantity or within a reasonable time, coagulation factor concentrates must be used. Neither fresh frozen plasma therapy nor treatment with coagulation factor concentrates has been the subject of detailed clinical study. Further studies are needed to work out guidelines for coagulation management in the case of massive blood loss."
CD010438,0,16953288,0,[Possibilities and limitations of thrombelastometry/-graphy].,"Thrombelastometry/-graphy provides information about clot strength and stability. Modified thrombelastometry/-graphy improved standardisation and diagnostic information using this system. Heparinase modified thrombelastometry/-graphy allows estimation of heparin. The introduction of FIBTEM on the ROTEM first allows a clear estimation of the plasmatic and the platelet component of clot strength, which may be of interest in managing haemostasis in perioperative setting. In this context the meaning of fibrinogen should be evaluated. As our clinical data show there is no predictive value of elevated D-dimers to hyperfibrinolysis in perioperative setting. However, thrombelastometry/-graphy do not deteckt disturbances in primary haemostasis such as von Willebrand Syndrom. The effect of acetylsalicylacid and clopidogrel do not have any influence on thrombelastometry/-graphy, as well. GPIIb/IIIa-Antagonists such as ReoPro may reduce clot strength at high dosis. A similar effect may be expected in severe M. Glanzmann. The correlation between coagulation time in thrombelastometry/-graphy (CT/r-value) to conventional coagulation may be low because of different activators used. The introduction of rotationthrombelastometry (ROTEM) provides a stable system suitable for bedside-monitoring."

The PDE-inhibitor amrinone has been associated with adverse effects on coagulation by decreasing platelets. To investigate the influence of enoximone on hemostasis, 18 patients undergoing elective aorto-coronary bypass grafting and receiving enoximone were compared to a control group (n = 18). In addition, the plasma levels of enoximone and its major metabolite (enoximone-sulfoxide) were studied following a single injection (0.5 mg/kg) and during a continuous infusion (5 and 10 micrograms/kg.min) before, during and after extracorporeal circulation (ECC). No difference between study and control groups was found for the parameters of coagulation during the investigation period; in particular there were no differences in platelet count and platelet function (thrombelastography). Following the single bolus, peak plasma levels decreased during ECC to ineffective levels. Continuous infusion, however, maintained effective plasma levels of enoximone; sulfoxide levels were twice as high as enoximone concentrations up until the end of the investigation period. It is concluded that enoximone can be judged to be safe in respect to its effects on coagulation even following ECC and at relatively high doses. The use of continuous infusion results in plasma levels which remain at an effective concentration through to the time that the patient is transferred to the intensive care unit."

When patients lose a large volume of blood, the lost plasma volume and the lost clotting factors must be substituted: in addition to electrolyte and colloidal solutions we use autologous fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Preoperatively we usually obtain FFP from the patient by plasmapheresis. All patients have tolerated the preoperative plasmapheresis very well and also the subsequent retransfusion of the intraoperatively saved autologous blood.

We measured the clotting time (CT), the maximum clot firmness (MCF), the early clot amplitude at 5 and 15 minutes (CA(5), CA(15)) and the clot lysis index (CLI(30)) with four tests containing specific reagents. (a) The INTEM test involving ellagic acid activated the intrinsic pathway and (b) the EXTEM test using tissue factor triggered the extrinsic pathway; (c) The FIBTEM test based on a platelet inhibitor (cytochalasin D) evaluated the contribution of fibrinogen to clot formation and (d) the APTEM test was similar to the EXTEM but was based on inhibition in vitro of fibrinolysis by aprotinin. CT and CLI(30) were not significantly modified during pregnancy whereas MCF, CA(5) and CA(15) (INTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM) increased significantly between the second and third trimesters (e.g. median [interquartile range]: MCF-FIBTEM, 13 [11-16] mm vs. 19 [17-23] mm, respectively, in controls and T3, p < 0.001).

Stable outpatients with coronary artery disease (n = 110) were treated with aspirin in a two 3 x 3 Latin square design (81, 162 and 325 mg/day for 4 weeks each). VerifyNow (arachidonic acid (AA) cartridge); light transmittance aggregometry; thrombelastography; PFA-100; flow cytometry; PlateletWorks; and urinary 11- dehydro thromboxane levels were measured. Multianalyte profiling measured fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor (vWF). Patients with >or=550 ARU by VerifyNow had increased 5 mM AA-, 5 microM ADP-, and 2 microg/mL collagen-induced platelet aggregation compared to patients with <550 ARU (p <or= 0.001). The highest ADP- and collagen-induced aggregation was present in the upper quartile by VerifyNow (p < 0.05). Fibrinogen or vWF levels did not differ between VerifyNow quartiles. Patients with high platelet reactivity to arachidonic acid identified by VerifyNow also exhibit increased reactivity to other important platelet agonists that is independent of fibrinogen and vWF levels.

Our goal was to further define the CORM-2-mediated mechanisms using colloids with known effects on coagulation/fibrinolytic proteins. Plasma diluted 0 or 30% with 0.9% NaCl, 5% human albumin, low molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch (130 kDa) or high molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch (450 kDa) was exposed to 0 or 100 μmol/l CORM-2 before activation with tissue factor (n = 8 per condition). A second identically diluted series of experiments were performed with the addition of tissue-type plasminogen activator. Thrombelastographic data were collected until clot strength stabilized or clot lysis occurred. Dilution resulted in fluid-specific decreases in velocity of clot growth, strength and clot growth time with progressive increases in macromolecule size. CORM-2 exposure significantly increased the velocity of clot formation and strength (thin fibrin fiber promoting), but not clot growth time, under all conditions. Fibrinolysis was enhanced to the greatest extent by hydroxyethyl starch (antiα2-antiplasmin effect), and CORM-2 addition attenuated fibrinolysis in all conditions (α2-antiplasmin enhancement). CORM-2 exposure attenuated the decrease in coagulation kinetics mediated by hemodilution by two different mechanisms based on kinetic profile differences between the diluents tested. Further laboratory-based investigation is warranted to further define the molecular mechanisms responsible for CORM-2-mediated effects on coagulation and fibrinolysis."

The pharmacological effect of FVIIa is short-lived and therefore with the recommended dose of 90 μg kg(-1), a bleeding episode is treated with multiple injections. A long-acting form of FVIIa that can ensure adequate haemostasis with a single infusion, without increasing the thrombotic risk, would therefore be beneficial. PEGylated liposomes (PEGLip) have been shown to bind FVIIa and to improve haemostatic efficacy in preclinical experiments. In the present phase I/II clinical trial, we assessed the safety and efficacy of PEGLip-formulated FVIIa in severe haemophilia A patients (FVIII≤1%) with inhibitors to FVIII. Each patient received one prophylactic infusion of standard FVIIa and one prophylactic infusion of PEGLip-formulated FVIIa. The order of the infusions was randomized and the two infusions were separated by a ten-day washout period. Efficacy assessed by thromboelastography revealed that PEGLip-FVIIa induced significantly shorter clotting times and produced higher clot firmnesses than standard FVIIa. Thrombin generation assays showed that PEGLip-FVIIa induced faster thrombin generation and higher peak levels of thrombin than standard FVIIa. These effects lasted up to 5 h postinfusion. Measurements of D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2 and fibrinogen showed no significant differences between the PEGLip-FVIIa and standard FVIIa treatments. PEGLip-FVIIa therefore showed improved haemostatic efficacy without increased risk of thrombosis and may be further developed for the treatment for bleeding episodes in haemophilia patients with inhibitors."

PCs (1-1.9 x 10(11) platelets) processed from 450 ml platelet-rich plasma were stored in 0.6-liter PO containers at 22 degrees C with flatbed agitation for up to 6 days. The pH of PCs was well maintained at the mean values of 7.0 in PO containers after 6 days in the well-oxygenated condition. The energy metabolism of stored platelets was determined. Oxygen consumption rates of platelets stored in PO containers averaged 1.5 nmol/min/10(9) platelets. The rates of glucose consumption and lactate production were 0.4 and 0.8 nmol/min/10(11) platelets, respectively. The rates of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation of platelets, 9.7 nmol/min/10(9) platelets, in PO containers did not differ from those in the PVC containers.

A modified lymphocyte collection protocol (Nebraska Surge) was used in all instances. Leukapheresis were performed after 1 or 2 courses of chemotherapy and started when peripheral blood leukocytes count reached 1 x 10e9/l and platelets count 80 x 10e9/l. A mean blood volume of 5.9 +/- 0.6 litres was processed per procedure and the mean yields for mononuclear cells, nucleated cells and CFU-GM were respectively 5.4 +/- 1.4 x 10e9, 4.9 +/- 1.6 x 10e9 and 128.5 +/- 182.3 x 10e4 per procedure. Haemonetics V50S had showed a mean collection efficiency for mononuclear cells of 67.5 +/- 5.0% per procedure. Results obtained are not significantly different from the ones obtained with an automated continuous flow separator even if extracorporeal circulation is consistently high in patients with a low hematocrit when the 250 ml Latham Bowl is used."

The thrombelastograph (TEG) was used to evaluate the effect of magnesium using blood from volunteers. Magnesium sulphate was added to one blood sample and another sample was used as a control. Both samples were tested simultaneously and the results evaluated against the magnesium concentration measured in each sample. At serum magnesium concentrations < 3 mmol litre-1, there were no significant effects of magnesium. With increasing magnesium concentrations there was a statistically significant but small prolongation of the r time, k time and r + k time. Maximum amplitude was affected only at magnesium concentrations > 7 mmol litre-1. Magnesium has only minimal effects on coagulation which are unlikely to be clinically important."

CD010438,0,18675136,0,Use of recombinant factor IX and thromboelastography in a patient with hemophilia B undergoing liver transplantation: a case report.,"Hemophilia B is a congenital recessive disorder caused by deficiency of coagulation factor IX (FIX). Surgical procedures can be performed in patients with hemophilia using high-purity and/or recombinant FIX, which has been shown to be safe and effective in surgical hemostasis. Liver transplantation is the only potentially curative treatment available for these patients, providing a long-term phenotypic cure for hemophilia. End-stage liver disease together with hemophilia exposes patients to greater risks of bleeding complications during the perioperative period with consequent difficulties in managing coagulopathy. The limited experiences reported by different investigators and the various strategies for clotting factor replacement make it difficult to define a single approach with respect to the optimal dose and method of administering FIX to achieve perioperative hemostasis. The limits of plasma-based coagulation tests--prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time--have made thromboelastography a valid alternative in this kind of surgery. It has been demonstrated to be a useful tool for real-time analysis of clot formation using a whole-blood assay format. Further, it accurately illustrates the clinical effects of procoagulant or anticoagulant interventions. In this article, we have described the usefulness of thromboelastography to monitor the ability of high-purity FIX supplementation to restore a normal coagulation state and to guide the perioperative administration of blood products in a successful orthotopic liver transplantation in a hemophilic patient with deficiencies of factors IX and X, presenting with hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma."

High incidence of hemostatic defects was present in both groups. Thromboelastogram, PTT, prothrombin and qualitative platelet abnormalities were most common. On the whole, severity of hemostatic alterations in cirrhosis was more pronounced than that found in CAH, FDPs were increased in more than 50% of the CAH cases and only in a few cirrhotic patients. Bleeding occurred more frequently in cirrhosis (55%) than in CAH (4%) and, within the cirrhotic patients' group, it was associated with a more severe thrombocytopenia."
CD010438,0,15142727,0,Effect of composite resin biodegradation products on oral streptococcal growth.,"Hydrolytic degradation by-products associated with the constitutive monomers 2,2-bis [4-(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloxypropoxy) phenyl] propane (bis-GMA), bisphenol A polyethylene glycol diether dimethacrylate (bis-EMA), and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEDGMA) used in dental restorative composites include bis-hydroxy-propoxyphenyl propane (bis-HPPP), ethoxylated bisphenol A (E-bisPA), methacrylic acid (MA), and triethylene glycol (TEG). These products are generated from the interaction of human salivary esterases with the composites. Recent findings have indicated that TEGDMA has the ability to modulate oral bacteria but it is unclear which components of TEGDMA are related to the observed effects. The objective of the current study was to investigate the influence of TEGDMA derived degradation products MA and TEG on the growth of three strains of oral bacteria: S. mutans strains NG8 and JH1005, and S. salivarius AT2. Bacterial growth rates were measured at 37 degrees C, and pH values of 5.5 (representative of cariogenic state) or 7.0 at concentrations of 0-50mmol/l for MA (Sigma, US) and 0-100mmol/l for TEG (Sigma, US). It was found that at pH 5.5 TEG significantly stimulated the growth of both S. mutans strains ( p<0.05 ) in the concentration range of 0.5-10.0mmol/l and stimulated the growth of S. salivarius AT2 for the entire concentration range tested (p<0.05). TEG (above 50mmol/1) did not significantly affect the doubling times of S. salivarius at pH of 7.0 and it inhibited the growth of both S. mutans strains above 50mmol/l at the same pH value. At pH 5.5 MA inhibited the growth of all three strains with increasing concentration. At neutral pH, the growth of S. mutans NG8 strain was significantly reduced by MA ( p<0.05 ) above 10mmol/l. In summary, these results indicate that TEG and MA modulate the growth rate of important oral bacteria in a concentration and pH dependent manner."

CD010438,0,22437051,0,Reduced coagulation at high altitude identified by thromboelastography.,"The impact of hypoxaemia on blood coagulation remains unclear despite use of a variety of measures to address the issue. We report the first use of thromboelastography (TEG) at high altitude to describe the dynamics of clot formation in whole blood samples. Seventeen healthy volunteers ascended to 5,300 m following an identical ascent profile; TEG measurements at 4,250 m and 5,300 m were compared with those from sea level. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and haematocrit were also measured. Ascent resulted in a decline in SpO2 from 97.8 (± 1.2) % at sea level to 86.9 (± 3.3) % at 4,250 m and 79.5 (± 5.8) % at 5,300 m (p<0.001); haematocrit rose from 43.7 (± 2.8) % at sea level, to 46.7 (± 3.9) % and 52.6 (± 3.2) % at 4,250 m and 5,300 m, respectively (p<0.01). TEG reaction (R)-time and kinetic (K)-time were both increased at 5,300 m compared to sea level, 8.95 (± 1.37) minutes (min) to 11.69 (± 2.91) min (p=0.016) and 2.40 (± 0.66) min to 4.99 (± 1.67) min (p<0.001), respectively. Additionally the alpha (α)-angle was decreased from 57.7 (± 8.2) to 51.6 (± 6.4) (p<0.001). There was no change in maximum amplitude (MA) on ascent to altitude. These changes are consistent with an overall pattern of slowed coagulation at high altitude."
CD010438,0,17299811,0,Triethylene glycol HO(CH2CH2O)3H.,"TEG is a liquid higher glycol of very low vapor pressure with uses that are primarily industrial. It has a very low order of acute toxicity by i.v., i.p., peroral, percutaneous and inhalation (vapor and aerosol) routes of exposure. It does not produce primary skin irritation. Acute eye contact with the liquid causes mild local transient irritation (conjunctival hyperemia and slight chemosis) but does not induce corneal injury. Animal maximization and human volunteer repeated insult patch tests studies have shown that TEG does not cause skin sensitization. A study with Swiss-Webster mice demonstrated that TEG aerosol has properties of a peripheral chemosensory irritant material and caused a depression of breathing rate with an RD(50) of 5140 mg m(-3). Continuous subchronic peroral dosing of TEG in the diet of rats did not produce any systemic cumulative or long-term toxicity. The effects seen were dose-related increased relative kidney weight, increased urine volume and decreased urine pH, probably a result of the renal excretion of TEG and metabolites following the absorption of large doses of TEG. There was also decreased hemoglobin concentration, decreased hematocrit and increased mean corpuscular volume, probably due to hemodilution following absorption of TEG. The NOAEL was 20 000 ppm TEG in diet. Short-term repeated aerosol exposure studies in the rat demonstrated that, by nose-only exposure, the threshold for effects by respiratory tract exposure was 1036 mg m(-3). Neither high dosage acute nor repeated exposures to TEG produce hepatorenal injury characteristic of that caused by the lower glycol homologues. Elimination studies with acute peroral doses of TEG given to rats and rabbits showed high recoveries (91-98% over 5 days), with the major fraction appearing in urine (84-94%) and only 1% as CO(2). TEG in urine is present in unchanged and oxidized forms, but only negligible amounts as oxalic acid. Developmental toxicity studies with undiluted TEG given by gavage produced maternal toxicity in rats (body weight, food consumption, water consumption, and relative kidney weight) with a NOEL of 1126 mg kg(-1) day(-1), and mice (relative kidney weight) with a NOEL of 5630 mg kg(-1) day(-1). Developmental toxicity, expressed as fetotoxicity, had a NOEL of 5630 mg kg(-1) day(-1) with the rat and 563 mg kg(-1) day(-1) with mice. Neither species showed any evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. There was no evidence for reproductive toxicity with mice given up to 3% TEG in drinking water in a continuous breeding study. TEG did not produce mutagenic or clastogenic effects in the following in vitro genetic toxicology studies: Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation test, SOS-chromotest in E. coli, CHO forward gene mutation test (HGPRT locus), CHO sister chromatid exchange test, and a chromosome aberration test with CHO cells. The use patterns suggest that exposure to TEG is mainly occupational, with limited exposures by consumers. Exposure is normally by skin and eye contact. Local and systemic adverse health effects by cutaneous exposure are likely not to occur, and eye contact will produce transient irritation without corneal injury. The very low vapor pressure of TEG makes it unlikely that significant vapor exposure will occur. Aerosol exposure is not a usual exposure mode, and acute aerosol exposures are unlikely to be harmful, although a peripheral sensory irritant effect may develop. However, repeated exposures to a TEG aerosol may result in respiratory tract irritation, with cough, shortness of breath and tightness of the chest. Recommended protective and precautionary measures include protective gloves, goggles or safety glasses and mechanical room ventilation. LC(50) data to various fish, aquatic invertebrates and algae, indicate that TEG is essentially nontoxic to aquatic organisms. Also, sustained exposure studies have demonstrated that TEG is of a low order of chronic aquatic toxicity. The bioconcentration potential, environmental hydrolysis, and photolysis rates are low, and soil mobility high. In the atmosphere TEG is degraded by reacting with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. These considerations indicate that the potential for ecotoxicological effects with TEG is low."
CD010438,0,16787830,0,Effects of cardiac surgery on hemostasis.,"Cardiac surgery affects both coagulation and platelet function. Revision of surgery due to bleeding has to be performed in 2% to 6% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and is generally associated with a marked deterioration in prognosis. Factors contributing to acquired hemostatic abnormalities in cardiac surgery include the use of anticoagulants as well as the activation and consumption of coagulation factors and platelets induced by the extracorporeal circulation. Prophylactic use of antifibrinolytic agents such as aprotinin and tranexamic acid has been demonstrated to reduce the blood loss by half. Adequacy of heparin-induced anticoagulation in the perioperative setting is commonly controlled by the activated clotting time. This method also indicates the correct reversal of the heparin effect by protamine. In recent years, thrombelastography has proved to be valuable for diagnosis of coagulopathy associated with cardiac surgery. In addition, the use of thrombelastography-based algorithms has been shown to reduce transfusion requirements. In contrast to point of care methods, laboratory assessment of hemostasis is more time-consuming and, thus, often not as rapidly available as required. At this time, the therapy for perioperative hemostatic abnormalities is based mainly on the administration of blood components (fresh frozen plasma and platelet concentrates). In the future, recombinant activated factor VIIa might prove to be a therapeutic option in patients with otherwise untractable bleeding, but the efficacy of recombinant activated factor VIIa has yet to be defined for this indication."
CD010438,0,20339323,0,"Effects of nadroparin, enoxaparin, and unfractionated heparin on endogenous factor Xa and IIa formation and on thrombelastometry profiles.","Measurements of anti-FXa or anti-FIIa (thrombin) activities are conventional tests for biological monitoring of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin treatment. It was the aim of our study to assess the anticoagulant efficacy of the LMWHs nadroparin and enoxaparin and that of unfractionated heparin not by the above-mentioned isolated measurements but in the physiological environment of clotting plasma or whole blood. The effects of increasing amounts of nadroparin, enoxaparin, or unfractionated heparin on the time-course of FXa or FIIa formation were investigated in tissue factor activated platelet-poor plasma using a subsampling technique and chromogenic substrates. Moreover, the anticoagulant efficacy of these drugs was also investigated in whole blood triggered by the physiological relevant activator collagen/endogenous thrombin using thrombelastometry. Nadroparin is as efficient as enoxaparin concerning suppression of endogenous FXa or FIIa formation. The two LMWHs are capable of suppressing the formation of FIIa as efficient as that of FXa. Compared with equivalent anti-FXa activity, unfractionated heparin is markedly more efficient in suppressing the formation of FXa and FIIa than the LMWHs. Corresponding results were obtained in whole blood. The anticoagulant efficacy of nadroparin was comparable with that of enoxaparin and the influence of unfractionated heparin on thrombelastometry parameters was markedly stronger than that of the two LMWHs. We conclude that LMWHs are efficient inhibitors not only of endogenous FXa formation but also of endogenous FIIa formation. Under our experimental conditions, the anticoagulant efficacy of nadroparin was comparable with that of enoxaparin but markedly lower than that of unfractionated heparin."

In the present investigation, the effect of roxifiban (class I) on ex vivo clot dynamics using recalcified blood was tested in normal, healthy volunteers (n = 7) dosed with 1 mg BID roxifiban for 9 days. Roxifiban inhibited platelet aggregation induced by 20 mumol/l adenosine diphosphate by 60-90% but did not significantly affect any of the TEG parameters either at peak, trough, or subtrough drug levels. Addition of 30 nmol/l roxifiban free acid (XV459; which is ineffective by itself to modify TEG parameters) to human blood obtained from roxifiban-treated subjects resulted in 45-60% (P < 0.01) inhibition of clot strength (maximum amplitude), 90-100% (P < 0.01) inhibition of initial kinetic of clot development (angle alpha), and 50-70% (P < 0.01) inhibition of early clot initiation (K). These data suggest that a subthreshold blood level of 40-50 nmol/l roxifiban active form was achieved in those subjects, as estimated from an in vitro calibration with XV459. These data indicate (not studied) that roxifiban, at a targeted clinical dosing regimen, failed to achieve sufficient exposure to modulate platelet-mediated clot retraction."
CD010438,0,10204988,0,Modified acrylic bone cement with high amounts of ethoxytriethyleneglycol methacrylate.,"One cause of arthroplasty failure is the brittle mechanical behavior of bone cements. However, the improvement of cement formulations must also be accompanied by the maintenance of a wide variety of characteristics. New bone cements were obtained by the substitution of high percentages, up to 60% (v/v), of methyl methacrylate (MMA) by a higher molecular weight and more hydrophilic monomer, ethoxytriethyleneglycol methacrylate (TEG). The essential advantages of these materials were the decrease of maximum temperature together with a decrease in the residual monomer content with respect to conventional cement formulations. The water absorption process obeyed diffusion laws and the equilibrium water content increased by the introduction of higher percentages of the hydrophilic component. This characteristic had an appreciable effect on the viscoelastic behavior analyzed by DMTA. These modified bone cements had reduced polymerization shrinkage and similar levels of porosity. Tensile test revealed that the introduction of TEGMA gave rise to an important modification of the mechanical behavior, with a noticeable increase in the fracture strain. This fact was also confirmed by means of the analysis of the fracture surfaces by SEM."

CD010438,0,10613656,0,The inhibitory effect of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin on initiation and extension of coagulation--a comparison with other anticoagulants.,"Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhsTM) was compared with various anticoagulants for in vitro anticoagulant effects on thrombin generation, clotting time, and thromboelastography. rhsTM as well as APC reduced the level of the peak of the thrombin generation curve, but we did not observe any time-delay to reach the peak. This effect of rhsTM was diminished in PC-deficient plasma and was closely associated with the inhibitory effect on prothrombinase and factor Va. On the other hand, hirudin and argatroban delayed the time to reach the level of the peak, without reducing it. rhsTM and other anticoagulants except for activated protein C (APC) were found to have concentration-dependent anticoagulant activity by conventional clotting tests. However, the concentration of rhsTM for clotting time was slightly affected by anti-protein C antibody. Moreover, the concentration of rhsTM required to inhibit thrombin activity directly was 50 times higher than that needed to inhibit thrombin generation. The effect of rhsTM on clot development was compared with that of other anticoagulants by thromboelastography; rhsTM reduced the growth of the clot but had little effect on the time to activate clotting, while the other anticoagulants had the opposite effect. This effect of rhsTM was completely abolished by the addition of anti-protein C or anti-protein S antibody. These findings suggest that rhsTM attenuates blood clotting by reducing the level of generated thrombin through protein C activation and subsequent factor Va inactivation and prothrombinase inhibition."

An alternative macromolecular agent for centrifugal leukapheresis.,"We studied a French modified fluid gelatin (MFG), substituting it for hydroxyethyl starch (HES) in leukapheresis procedures using three currently available blood cell separators, and observing its effects on the function of platelets and granulocytes. As a cell-collecting agent, we found MFG to be as effective as HES with intermittent flow centrifugation (Haemonetics), and slightly less so with one continuous flow device (IBM 2997). MFG was clearly less effective than HES with the Fenwal CS-3000 continuous flow separator, although we have reason to believe it would be possible to improve efficiency with this machine by changing the operating variables. Tests of platelet and granulocyte function showed negligible alteration with either agent and no difference between them. MFG disappears much more rapidly from the circulation than HES (after a single injection, it is undetectable by the third day). Reaction frequency with MFG was about the same as that of HES, with perhaps somewhat more frequent allergic manifestations."

CD010438,0,155020,0,Fibrinolytic activity in gastric venous blood. A comparison between normal and diseased stomachs.,"The fibrinolytic activity of blood draining from the stomachs of patients with gastroduodenal disease has been compared with the fibrinolytic activity of blood in the systemic venous circulation and with the blood draining from normal stomachs. Gastric venous blood from normal and diseased stomachs contains greater amounts of plasminogen activator than simultaneously sampled systemic venous blood. However, gastric venous fibrinolytic activity does not differ between the normal and diseased stomachs and thus indicates that increased gastric venous fibrinolysis is not just a characteristic of the diseased stomach. The studies suggest that stress may cause activation of the fibrinolytic system in gastric venous blood with the release of small amounts of free plasmin. It is postulated that local fibrinolysis may play a part in potentiating gastric hemorrhage."

Inhibition of plasmin generation by tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase and streptokinase were studied by both FPA and TEG while that of plasmin could only be examined by FPA. TEG was more sensitive than FPA in general and for the detection of streptokinase inhibition in particular. Derivative (3) was 2-50 times more inhibitory than (1) or (2) depending on the enzyme studied and the assay system used. The thrombin selectivities of (1)-(3) were defined as the thrombin to fibrinolytic enzyme potency ratios. Data obtained by the FPA and thrombin time assay indicated (1) and (2) to be 2-80 times more selective for thrombin than (3). On the other hand, the values determined by TEG and recalcification assay showed the thrombin selectivity of (2) to be two to three times higher than that of (1), and (3) to have no such selectivity. According to TEG studies, (1) and (2) assisted rather than inhibited fibrinolysis by reducing the elasticity of human plasma clots."
CD010438,0,7276077,0,Coagulation changes during major surgery and relationship to post-operative deep vein thrombosis.,"Nineteen patients undergoing aortic surgery during which 5,000 units of heparin were given intravenously were compared with 39 patients undergoing laparotomy or herniorrhaphy. There was an expected significant reduction in coagulability as measured by thrombelastography in those patients undergoing aortic surgery. Moreover, the early post-operative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) rate was significantly less. This implies that a reduction in coagulability by I.V. heparin during surgery is associated with a lower incidence of early post-operative deep vein thrombosis. Among the laparotomy and hernia group who developed a DVT, coagulability was significantly greater both before and during the operation and on the first post-operative day."

CD010438,0,12761010,0,The effect of graded hypothermia (36 degrees C-32 degrees C) on hemostasis in anesthetized patients without surgical trauma.,"The isolated effects of hypothermia on hemostasis have not been investigated in healthy humans. We cooled 16 anesthetized patients scheduled for elective intracranial surgery to 32 degrees C body core temperature and assessed prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombelastogram (TEG), closure time, and platelet count at 36 degrees C, 34 degrees C, and 32 degrees C body core temperature after the induction of anesthesia but before surgical intervention. Activated partial thromboplastin time, hematocrit, and closure time did not change, whereas PT and platelet count decreased during cooling. Platelet count decreased without a decrease in hematocrit; hence, a dilution by administered fluids seemed unlikely. The small decrease of platelet count is probably clinically irrelevant in patients with normal platelet count and function. The small decrease in PT indicates an alteration of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. TEG measurements showed a delay of clot formation in temperature-adjusted measurements but showed no change if the test temperature was 37 degrees C. This indicates that hypothermia reduces plasmatic coagulation and platelet reactivity. However, the clot strength is not altered by hypothermia. All coagulation variables remained within the normal ranges. Our results may indicate that moderate short-term (4-h) hypothermia has only minor adverse effects in healthy humans. We can make no statement about the effects of hypothermia of longer duration."

As no reference method is specified by the standards, we have adapted a technique where pseudo-peroxydasic activity of the hemoglobin is revealed by 3,3'-5,5', tetramethylbenzidine, a non carcinogenic chromogen derivate from benzidine. A 4 points reference scale is plotted for each plasma to be tested, thus reducing eventual interferences between pseudo-peroxydasic activity of the hemoglobin and other plasma proteins. We compared our modified technique to other existing ones: Vanzetti's extraction technique [8] whose main drawbacks are the use of flammable solvents and carcinogenic chromogen. Standefer's technique [10] involving plasma preincubation in H2O2 solution, which reveals protein interferences but is imprecise as it relies on only one reference point and does not show whether chromogen saturation is present. The level fixed by regulations is higher than the mean level indicated by our method, based on 118 samples of fresh plasma obtained by double centrifugation of whole blood collected on CPD as anticoagulant. It is also higher than the level indicated by the same method for plasma samples drawn from continuous or discontinuous flow cytapheresis (IBM 2997; Haemonetics V 50) using ACD - A or ACD - AA 16 as anticoagulant. Our method measures with precision low levels in plasma. Furthermore it is cheap, simple and easy to run in a blood transfusion center."

CD010438,0,15880369,0,Blood component collection by apheresis.,"Apheresis component collection is a rapidly growing area in the blood collection field. Several instruments with varying capabilities are available. This is a brief review of the equipment available for granulocyte and apheresis component collection and indications for their use. In the United States, granulocytes are collected with the Fenwal CS3000, Fenwal CS3000 Plus, COBE (Gambro) Spectra, Haemonetics LN9000, and Fresenius AS 104. The use of hetastarch for sedimenting agent and stimulation with G-CSF and G-CSF plus dexamethasone have substantially increased granulocyte yields. Plateletapheresis is performed in the United States on the Fenwal CS3000, Fenwal CS3000 Plus, Fenwal Amicus, COBE (Gambro) Spectra, Gambro Trima Version 4, Gambro Trima Accel (Version 5), and Haemonetics LN9000. Automated red blood cell (RBC) collections are performed with the Haemonetics MCS+LN8150, Gambro Trima Version 4, Gambro Trima Accel (Version 5), Amicus, and Baxter Alyx. The RBC can be collected concurrently (with other components) in some instruments or separately in others. Plasma is collected concurrently on several instruments. Plasmapheresis for plasma only is performed on the Fenwal Autopheresis C and Haemonetics PCS2. Granulocyte yields range from 0.46 x 10(10) to 1.0 x 10(10) for unstimulated donors and 2.1 x 10(10) to 2.6 x 10(10) for donors stimulated with dexamethasone or prednisone. The use of G-CSF and G-CSF with dexamethasone has substantially increased granulocyte yields with yields of 4.1 x 10(10) to 10.8 x 10(10) reported. Platelet collection rates of 0.045-0.115 x 10(11) plt/min have been reported. Collection efficiencies of 46-85.7% have been reported. Automated (apheresis) component collection has the advantages of controlled volumes or doses of component, efficient use of the donor, multiple components from the same donor, better inventory control, and better quality control due to less manipulation of the individual components. Disadvantages of automated component collection include the use of expensive equipment and disposables, the need for specially trained machine operators, and lower capacity to collect large volumes of blood compared to whole blood donation. The use of apheresis component collection is rapidly growing to provide the best blood components in the most efficient manner."

In vitro incubation with heparinase allows TEG monitoring during CPB, despite heparin anticoagulation. Hypothermia impairs coagulation, but these effects cannot be assessed by standard coagulation tests performed at 37 degrees C. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of hypothermia on TEG. Therefore, we have compared normothermic and temperature-adapted TEG in 30 patients undergoing CPB. Our data showed significantly impaired reaction time (r), kinetic time (k), and angle alpha (alpha) in temperature-adapted compared with normothermic TEG. Maximum amplitude (MA), reflecting absolute clot strength, was not affected at temperatures of 33-37 degrees C. These findings indicate a decrease in the speed of clot formation, but not absolute deterioration in clot quality. Furthermore, heparinase-modified TEG indicated that there were nine cases in which heparin effects persisted after heparin reversal with protamine, providing a rational guide to protamine therapy."

CD010438,0,14744480,0,Design of attachment type of drug delivery system by complex formation of avidin with biotinyl drug model and biotinyl saccharide.,"Recent studies have focused on the active targeting of drug delivery by combining a homing device and antitumor drug. For this purpose, synthesis of a well-designed vehicle (such as polymer/drug conjugates or nanoparticles) carrying a drug and a homing device requires many steps. We propose a new type of drug delivery system (DDS) by formation of a complex containing avidin (Av) plus biotinyl drug with a biotinyl homing device, which easily accommodates the combination of various drugs and homing devices. The targetable drug complex can be prepared by selecting an appropriate biotinyl drug derivative and a biotinyl homing device and mixing them with avidin. Fluorescent dye with 5-(and-6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) was used as a drug model, and galactose (Gal) recognized by liver parenchymal cells was used as a homing device. TAMRA and galactose were attached to biotin (Bio) through a triethyleneglycol (TEG) spacer group to give Bio-TEG-TAMRA conjugate and Bio-TEG-Gal conjugate, respectively. Confocal laser scanning microscopic studies suggest that the complexes prepared by mixing Bio-TEG-Gal conjugate and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled Av (feed molar ratio 4:1), and mixing Bio-TEG-Gal conjugate, Bio-TEG-TAMRA conjugate and FITC-labeled Av are internalized into the hepatoma cells through a receptor-mediated endocytosis mechanism."

It may be caused by surgical issues, coagulopathy caused by the side effects of the intravenous fluids administered to produce plasma volume expansion such as hydroxyl ethyl starch (HES). In order to thwart this hemorrhagic issue, few agents are available. Fibrinolytic inhibitors like tranexamic acid (TA) may be effective modes to promote blood conservation; but the possible complications of thrombosis of coronary artery graft, precludes their generous use in coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The issue is a balance between agents that promote coagulation and those which oppose it. Therefore, in this study we have assessed the effects of concomitant use of HES and TA. Thromboelastogram (TEG) was used to assess the effect of the combination of HES and TA. With ethical committee approval and patient's consent, 100 consecutive patients were recruited for the study. Surgical and anesthetic techniques were standardized. Patients fulfilling our inclusion criteria were randomly allocated into 4 groups of 25 each. The patients in group A received 20 ml/kg of HES (130/0.4), 10 mg/kg of T.A over 30 minutes followed by infusion of 1 mg/kg/hr over the next 12 hrs. The patients in group B received Ringer's lactate + TA at same dose. The patients in the Group C received 20 ml/kg of HES. Group D patients received RL. Fluid therapy was goal directed. Total blood loss was assessed. Reaction time (r), α angle, maximum amplitude (MA) values of TEG were assessed at baseline, 12, 36 hrs. The possible perioperative myocardial infraction (MI) was assessed by electrocardiogram (ECG) and troponin T values at the baseline, postoperative day 1. Duration on ventilator, length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) were also assessed. The demographical profile was similar among the groups. Use of HES increased blood loss significantly (P < 0.05). Concomitant use of TA reduced blood loss when used along with HES. r value was prolonged at 12 hours in all the groups and α angle was reduced at 12 hours in all the groups, where as MA value was reduced at 12 th hour in the HES group compared to the baseline and increased in TA + HES group. These findings were statistically significant. No significant change in Troponin T values/ECG, duration of ventilation and LOS ICU was observed. No adverse events was noticed in any of the four groups. HES (130/0.4) used at a dose of 20 ml/kg seems to produce coagulopathy causing increased blood loss perioperatively. Hemodilution produced by fluid therapy seems to produce Coagulopathy as observed by TEG parameters. Concomitant use of TA with HES appears to reverse these changes without causing any adverse effects in patients undergoing OPCAB surgery."

CD010438,0,10225766,0,Automated plateletpheresis does not cause an increase in platelet activation in volunteer donors.,"Activation of platelets during collection and storage has been implicated as a major cause of the platelet storage lesion. In this study, we investigated the effect of an automated plateletpheresis procedure on the in vivo platelet activation in 20 volunteer donors. Peripheral blood samples were collected immediately before and after plateletpheresis on the Haemonetics V50 Blood Cell Separator. Activation of platelets was determined by quantitating the amount of platelet P-selectin (CD62) expression using a whole blood method on flow cytometry. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen, and ristocetin induced platelet aggregations were also measured on a whole blood impedance aggregometer. Plateletpheresis caused a significant decrease in the CD62-positive platelet percentage and aggregation responses to 3 agonists. We concluded that the plateletpheresis procedure did not cause an increase in platelet activation in donors. Further studies are required to elucidate whether activated platelets are collected during the procedure or removed from the circulation of the donor and replaced by resting platelets, activated platelets bind to leukocytes or endothelial cells, and the plateletpheresis procedure is a powerful stimulus for platelet activation."

CD010438,0,17102650,0,Tranexamic acid does not correct the haemostatic impairment caused by hydroxyethyl starch (200 kDa/0.5) after cardiac surgery.,"We investigated the effect of intravenous tranexamic acid on hydroxyethyl starch (HES)-induced clot strength impairment after cardiac surgery. Patients were randomized to receive either 1 g tranexamic acid or the same volume of 0.9% saline after administration of 15 ml/kg of 6% HES (molecular weight, 200 kDa; degree of substitution, 0.5) in the immediate postoperative period. Modified thromboelastometry (ROTEM) using different activators [intrinsic ROTEM (InTEM), extrinsic ROTEM (ExTEM), fibrinogen ROTEM (FibTEM)] was carried out to evaluate clot formation and lysis. The clot formation time was prolonged, and the maximum clot firmness (MCF) and shear elastic modulus [G = 5000 x MCF / (100-MCF), dynes/cm(2)] decreased (all activators of ROTEM) after completion of HES (P < 0.001, two-factor analysis of variance). These abnormalities in blood coagulation persisted despite tranexamic acid. Maximal lysis (FibTEM), indicative of fibrinolytic activity, was increased after HES but no effect of tranexamic acid was observed. The cumulative chest tube drainage until the first postoperative morning was not different between the groups (1008 +/- 251 and 1081 +/- 654 ml, P = 0.698, respectively). We conclude that after cardiopulmonary bypass, HES-induced impairment in clot formation and strength, or increased fibrinolytic capacity, is not reversed by the administration of tranexamic acid."
CD010438,0,19811222,0,"Effects of clopidogrel on ""aspirin specific"" pathways of platelet inhibition.","The most widely accepted methods of assessing response to clopidogrel involve isolated ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Whilst poor response determined by these assays correlates with adverse clinical events, the number of ""poor responders"" is far higher than the number of events attributed to treatment failure. Clopidogrel may have effects that cannot be assessed using isolated ADP-induced aggregation. We have investigated the effect of clopidogrel on Arachidonic Acid (AA) induced platelet activation-an ""aspirin specific"" pathway using a novel near patient assay. Thirty four volunteers on no medication and 36 patients, on maintenance therapy with aspirin 75 mg daily, were recruited. Blood tests for Thrombelastogram PlateletMapping were taken immediately prior to and 6 hours after administration of a 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose. Changes in the area under the response curve at 15 minutes (AUC15) with both ADP- and AA-stimulation were calculated as were the corresponding percentage platelet and percentage clotting inhibition (%PIn and %CIn). There were predictable and significant changes in the AUC15 of the ADP channel in response to clopidogrel and the corresponding %PIn and %CIn in both volunteers and patients. There were also significant reductions in the AUC15 of the AA channel (presented as Mean +/- 95%CI), by 27.2 +/- 11.8%, p = 0.005 in volunteers and 35.0 +/- 8.2%, p < 0.001 in patients) and increases in the %PIn and %CIn calculated using the AA channel in volunteers (by 20.0 +/- 11.4%, p + 0.02 and 32.3 +/- 12.8%, p < 0.001 respectively) and patients (by 24.2 +/- 8.6%, p < 0.001 and by 18.0 +/- 8.6, p < 0.001 respectively).

CD010438,0,17102653,0,Ethanol impairs coagulation and fibrinolysis in whole blood: a study performed with rotational thromboelastometry.,"The objective was to study the effects of ethanol on coagulation and fibrinolysis in whole blood. Blood samples from healthy volunteers were analyzed before and after in-vitro addition of ethanol in order to achieve ethanol concentrations of 0, 1, 2 and 4 per thousand, respectively (0, 22, 44 and 88 mmol/l). Coagulation and fibrinolysis were then assessed using rotational thromboelastometry. We found that increasing ethanol levels increasingly impaired coagulation as evaluated with rotational thromboelastometry, with a maximum prolongation of the clot formation time of 118% at an ethanol level of 4 per thousand (P < 0.000001). We also found a very strong impairment of fibrinolysis already at an ethanol level of 1 per thousand. This is the first study assessing the effects of ethanol on coagulation and fibrinolysis in a whole blood model. The impairment of coagulation is similar in nature to the impairment found in patients suffering from hypothermia. The impairment is at a level that may be of clinical importance (e.g. in patients suffering from trauma). The inhibition of fibrinolysis is obvious already at an ethanol level of 1 per thousand and it may be a contributing factor to the increased amount of coronary and cerebrovascular ischemic events after binge drinking."

She had recently undergone a coronary artery stent implantation and was treated with both clopidogrel and aspirin. Despite this dual antiplatelet therapy, uneventful spinal anaesthesia was administered following platelet transfusion.

The present study was designed to determine the patient benefits of PRP by examining hemostatic changes in coagulation screens and viscoelastic whole blood monitoring (Thrombelastography, [TEG]). One hundred fifteen patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were prospectively randomized into a blinded study. Sixty-three patients had 20 percent of the circulating plasma volume sequestered prior to heparinization and pheresed into PRP, which was reinfused 10 minutes following heparin reversal with protamine. The control (CTR) group of 52 patients were exposed to no sequestration procedure. Patients were followed to discharge and 112 parameters, including anthropometric, operative, and postoperative factors, were measured. There were no significant differences between patient groups in preoperative, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), or surgical parameters. Average PRP volume was 600+/-100 ml with a total platelet yield of 1.1 billion platelets per patient. TEG indices were determined at four distinct times during the surgical procedure. The CTR group had significantly higher pre-CPB TEG indices of 2.3+/-1.2 and 2.1+/-1.2 (mean+/-SD), vs. 1.8+/-1.5 and 1.4+/-1.7 in the PRP group (p less than .04). Following heparin reversal, pre-PRP reinfusion TEG values were similar between groups, although both groups had significantly decreased indices when compared to pre-CPB values.

CD010438,0,20625277,0,Plasmin-induced procoagulant effects in the blood coagulation: a crucial role of coagulation factors V and VIII.,"Plasminogen activators provide effective treatment for patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, paradoxical elevation of thrombin activity associated with failure of clot lysis and recurrent thrombosis has been reported. Generation of thrombin in these circumstances appears to be owing to plasmin (Plm)-induced activation of factor (F) XII. Plm catalyzes proteolysis of several coagulant factors, but the roles of these factors on Plm-mediated procoagulant activity remain to be determined. Recently developed global coagulation assays were used in this investigation. Rotational thromboelastometry using whole blood, clot waveform analysis and thrombin generation tests using plasma, showed that Plm (> or =125 nmol/l) shortened the clotting times in similar dose-dependent manners. In particular, the thrombin generation test, which was unaffected by products of fibrinolysis, revealed the enhanced coagulation with an approximately two-fold increase of peak level of thrombin generation. Studies using alpha2-antiplasmin-deficient plasma revealed that much lower dose of Plm (> or =16 nmol/l) actually contributed to enhancing thrombin generation. The shortening of clotting time could be observed even in the presence of corn trypsin inhibitor, supporting that Plm exerted the procoagulant activity independently of FXII. In addition, using specific coagulation-deficient plasmas, the clot waveform analysis showed that Plm did not shorten the clotting time in only FV-deficient or FVIII-deficient plasma in prothrombin time-based or activated partial thromboplastin time-based assay, respectively. Our results indicated that Plm did possess procoagulant activity in the blood coagulation, and this effect was likely attributed by multicoagulation factors, dependent on FV and/or FVIII."

Factors influencing the efficacy of the filter were investigated. The pH of the filtrate was 7.0, the temperature 28 degrees C and filtration rate 80 ml/min. Reduction of the filtration rate to 30 ml/min (784 doses) reduced leucodepletion failure to 0.38%. Measurement of the leucocyte count, pre- and post-filtration of the platelet products, revealed that donations from 1% of donors contained substantially larger numbers of leucocytes in pre-filter samples (300-1500/microl) than in control samples (35-70/microl). This number tends to increase progressively with subsequent donations in these individuals, leading to leucodepletion failure, whilst peripheral leucocyte counts remain normal. The new continuous filtration protocol (version C) using a less impact filter LRF-XL and a lower (7 ml/min) head pressure was also effective but failure still occurred twice on one of the donors who persistently showed high pre-filter count. We conclude that leucodepletion failures in the Haemonetics system are related to both donor leucocyte (i.e., being light and non-adherent) and operational/filter performance."

CD010438,0,7818056,0,Thrombelastographic patterns following abdominal aortic surgery.,"Postoperative changes in thrombelastographic patterns were studied in thirty patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic bypass surgery. Native whole blood thrombelastography was performed preoperatively and on days 1, 2, and 3 postoperatively. The thrombelastographic changes included a decrease in r on day one (P < 0.0001), with concurrent increases in alpha (P < 0.0001) and MA (P < 0.001). On days 2 and 3 there were further increases in MA (P < 0.0001). These changes indicate enhanced procoagulant activity and progressive increases in maximum clot strength. The results confirm that hypercoagulability occurs in whole blood following abdominal aortic bypass surgery. Further studies are warranted to determine whether modification of postoperative hypercoagulability reduces the incidence of thrombotic complications in this group of patients."

In all the patients, the pattern of the disease contained an epilepsy syndrome that required mono- or combination therapy with valproic acid. Laboratory indicators of clinical hypocoagulation were found to develop during the use of valproic acid, and its monotherapy in particular. Hemorrhagic complications were also analyzed in not only the immediate, but also late postoperative period (for as long as 6 months after surgery). Two cases of severe late complications, such as formation of chronic subdural hematomas requiring surgical intervention, were diagnosed in the valproate monotherapy group. A tactic using a thromboelastographic technique is proposed to prepare these patients for further neurosurgical intervention."

The following case report describes a newborn patient with complex congenital heart disease and respiratory failure whose pre-operative coagulopathy was aggressively managed prior to surgical correction. A 5-day-old, 2.5 kg child presented with interrupted aortic arch, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus. On admission, he was in respiratory arrest suffering from profound acidemia. In addition, the child was hypothermic (30.1 degrees C), septic (Streptococcus viridans), and coagulopathic (disseminated intravascular coagulation-DIC). The patient was immediately intubated and initial coagulation assessment revealed the following: prothrombin time (PT) 48.9 s (international normalized ratio (INR) 15.7), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) >106 s, platelet count 30,000 mm(3), fibrinogen 15 mg dL(-1) and antithrombin III (AT-III) 10%. Before cardiac surgery could be performed, the patient's DIC was corrected with the administration of cryoprecipitate (15 ml), fresh frozen plasma (300 ml), and platelets (195 ml). In spite of the large transfusion of fresh frozen plasma, the AT-III activity, measured as a percentage, remained depressed at 33. Initial thromboelastographic (TEG) determination revealed an index of +2.02, and following 100 IU administration of an AT-III concentrate, declined to -2.32. Sequential TEG profiles were performed over several days, with the results used to guide both transfusion and medical therapy. The congenital heart defect correction was subsequently performed with satisfactory initial results, but the patient developed a fungal infection and expired on the 16th post-operative day. The present case describes techniques of coagulation management for a newborn with both a severe hemostatic defect and congenital heart disease."

CD010438,0,8523015,0,Prospective randomized evaluation of blood salvage techniques for primary total hip arthroplasty.,"A controlled, randomized, prospective study was performed evaluating the need for perioperative blood salvage for primary total hip arthroplasty patients who had donated autologous blood before surgery. One hundred fifty-three patients able to donate at least 2 units of autologous blood were divided into four groups. In group 1 (35 patients), intraoperative and postoperative Cell-Saver (Haemonetics, Braintree, MA) was employed. In group 2 (40 patients), a postoperative Solcotrans (Smith & Nephew Richards, Memphis, TN) reinfusion protocol was followed. In group 3 (40 patients), a closed-suction Hemovac drain (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN) was placed. In group 4, (38 patients), no drain was used. Decisions for transfusion were based on clinical and laboratory parameters and made in conjunction with medical consultation. All autologous blood was routinely reinfused. There was no statistically significant difference in transfusion requirements or wound complications among the four groups. Hemoglobin and hematocrit changes between groups also were not statistically significant, but a power test suggested insufficient patient numbers for absolute reliability of this observation. Only five patients (3.3%) in this study received homologous blood. Four of these patients were in the Solcotrans group and one was in the Cell-Saver group. Two reoperations were performed: one for hematoma (Solcotrans group) and one for a sewn-in drain. It is concluded that expensive perioperative blood salvage techniques are usually not needed in patients who have a primary total hip arthroplasty without cement and who have donated 2 units of blood before operation."

In RA patients, coagulation time (k) and reaction time (r)+k were shorter, maximal amplitude (ma) was larger and lysis time (LT) was longer comparing with those in healthy control. Especially LT and ma showed marked differences between RA patients and control subjects. The mild RA patients whose Lansbury's activity indexes were 0-19% had significant differences from healthy control subjects, in order of LT less than ma less than r+less than k, the probability values were smaller. Significant coefficients of positive correlations with Lansbury's activity index were higher in order of LT greater than LT/k greater than ma x LT. These findings suggested that RA patients had fibrin formation, which had close relations with maximal amplitude (ma) and lysis time (LT) which had positive correlation with Lansbury's activity index."

CD010438,0,21277261,0,Platelet activation of platelet concentrates derived from buffy coat and apheresis methods.,"Preparation for storage may cause platelet activation. The quality of platelet concentrates plays an important role in transfusion therapy. Platelet concentrates are produced by different centrifugation methods; buffy coat (buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates-BC) and plateletpheresis (apheresis-derived platelet concentrates-APC). Their quality was assessed using the following parameters: platelet, WBC and RBC counts pH, volume, platelet factor 4 (PF4) and Annexin V. The present paper compares the quality of both platelet preparations in vitro. In this experimental study, 30 platelet concentrates were harvested with the Haemonetics MCS plus and 30 units via the buffy coat (BC) method. The percentages of Annexin V expression, PF4 levels, platelet, WBC and RBC counts, pH and volume were measure immediately after collection and after 3 days of storage. During storage for up to 3 days, BC units displayed, no significant pH or RBC, difference in comparison with apheresis preparations (p>0.05). During storage for up to 3 days, BC units displayed a significant increase in the PF4 and Annexin V expression, compared to the apheresis preparations on day three (p<0.05). The kinetics of PF4 and Annexin V levels are influenced by the method used to prepare platelets for storage. The different levels of PF4 and Annexin V in BCs and APCs clearly demonstrates a progressive activation of BC platelets exceeding that of APC. However, in vivo studies should be performed to confirm these findings."

The ultrafiltrability of LMWH has not been previously examined. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of continuous ultrafiltration on the concentraton of a LMWH, enoxaparin. An in vitro analysis was performed using fresh whole human blood and an extracorporeal circuit containing four parallel ultrafiltrators and a cardiotomy reservoir with an integrated heat exchanger. Constant conditions included temperature (37 degrees C), flow (0.20 L-min(-1)) transmembrane pressure (200 mmHg), and hematocrit (25 +/- 2%). Samples were collected at the inlet, outlet, and ultrafiltrate line at one and three min for one control trial and again for each of the four hemoconcentrators following the bolus of enoxaparin. Coagulation measurements included a viscoelastic monitor (TEG), activated clotting time (ACT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and quantitative analysis utilizing a membrane-based electrode for potentiometric measurement of polyanionic concentrations of enoxaparin. Enoxaparin concentration, from inlet to outlet, increased from 2.95 +/- 0.64 to 5.89 +/- 0.95 (p < .001) at 1 min and 4.24 +/- 0.49 to 7.89 +/- 0.606 (p < .001) at 3 min. Kinetic clot activity, as assessed by the TEG index, decreased from -3.8 +/- 2.5 vs. -10.5 +/- 6.0; (p < .01) pre- to postultrafiltrator samples after 3 min. ACT and aPTT results demonstrated no significant change. In conclusion, this study demonstrates enoxaparin is concentrated with the use of continuous ultrafiltration. Functional coagulation studies also indicate a concentrating effect, primarily via the TEG."

CD010438,0,1198682,0,Viable lymphocytes in frozen washed blood.,"Samples of glycerolized, frozen, packed cells, were washed by each of three systems and then were cultrued for viable lymphocytes using the short-term culture method. Of the 39 samples, 17 (43.6%) showed definite evidence of growth of lymphocytes. Of the 17, 11(64.7%) were washed by Elutramatic, two (11.8%) by Haemonetics, and four (23.5%) by IBM. The 4 C prefreeze (two to five days) as well as the -80 C (21 To 40 days) storage times were the same for both positive and negative specimens. In all samples, clumps of distorted granulocytes with pyknotic nuclei were seen in addition to a number of well-preserved mononucleated white cells. In the 17 specimens which showed growth, incorporation of 3H-thymidine was seen only in the PHA-induced blast cells; typical mitotic figures were seen in some cultures. These observations demonstrate that lymphocytes remain viable in frozen blood stored at -80 C up to 40 days. The significant difference in removal of viable lymphocytes noted in specimens washed by different instruments requires further evaluation."
CD010438,0,18670387,0,Intraoperative coagulation was more interfered by HES 200/0.5 than normal saline in off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.,Rapid fluid administration is often necessary for anesthesiologists to maintain intravascular volume in off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) with acceptable hematocrits.

Effects of variations in corticosteroid regimen and donor selection.,"The factors of donor selection, corticosteroid drug choice, dose, timing and route of administration were studied to optimize granulocyte yield employing the Haemonetics Model 30 Blood Processor. Our data suggest that donors giving one excellent yield do not necessarily do so again. Donors with high initial granulocyte counts had only marginal increases in counts after taking corticosteroids. Selecting donors on the basis of high previous yield or granulocyte count is not a feasible strategy for improving granulocyte yields. Highest yields of granulocytes (16 X 10(9) total; 4 X 10(9)/liter processed) were obtained with any of four split-dose corticosteroid regimen. This increment is almost twice as large as the previously reported improvement using continuous-flow centrifugation. The choice of steroid, the route of administration and the timing of the split doses are not critical."
CD010438,0,9874863,0,The effect of coagulation protection with combination of epsilon aminocaproic acid and plasma saver in open-heart surgery.,"Bleeding remains a major complication and a major determinant in the prognosis of open-heart surgery. Coagulopathy related to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) seems to be the culprit. Since homologous blood transfusion in many occasions is not only responsible for mobidity and mortality but also increases medical costs. Therefore, the application of autologous blood transfusion including components such as PRBC, FFP and platelets concentrate is inevitable and comes in its stead. To reduce the use of homologous plasma and platelets transfusion in open-heart surgery, we designed a study to utilize the combination of autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) and epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) to evaluate its effects on blood loss and blood component transfusion in open-heart patients."
CD010438,0,19347258,0,Development of in situ-forming hydrogels for hemorrhage control.,"We report the preparation of in situ-forming hydrogels, composed of oxidized dextran (Odex) and amine-containing polymers, for their potential use as a wound dressing to promote blood clotting. Dextran was oxidized by sodium periodate to introduce aldehyde groups to form hydrogels, upon mixing in solution with different polymers containing primary amine groups, including polyallylamine (PAA), oligochitosan and glycol chitosan. A series of experiments were conducted to identify the optimum gelation condition for the Odex-PAA system. The polymer concentration appeared to have a major effect on gelation time and the polymer weight ratio affected the resulting gel content and swelling. Other influencing factors included pH of the buffer used to dissolve each polymer, PAA molecular weight, and the type of individual material. The latter also contributed significantly to gel content and swelling. Thromboelastography was used to examine the effects of the in situ gelation on blood coagulation in vitro, where the Odex-PAA combination was found to be most pro-hemostatic, as indicated by a decrease in clotting time and an increase in clot strength. The results of this study demonstrated that in situ-forming hydrogels could promote clotting in vitro; however, further studies are required to determine if the same hydrogel formulations are effective in controlling hemorrhage in vivo."
CD010438,0,8847781,0,[Blood coagulation-fibrinolysis system during transurethral resection evaluated by thrombelastography].,"Intraoperative changes in blood coagulation-fibrinolysis system were evaluated in 21 patients under epidural anesthesia by thrombelastography. Ten patients received transurethral resection of prostate (TUR-P) and 11 patients received transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TUR-Bt). Thrombelastographic variables: reaction time (R), coagulation time (K), maximum amplitude (MA), and amplitude 60 min after MA (A 60) were measured. The coagulability was evaluated by R + K, the absolute strength of clot by MA, and fibrinolysis using MA-A60. There was no significant change of these indices in TUR-Bt group. On the other hand, in TUR-P group, R + K was significantly shortened and MA-A60 had a tendency to increase it, but MA caused no change. Resected prostatic weight correlated significantly with the decrease of MA, and had a tendency to correlate with the increase of MA-A60 in TUR-P group. Both coagulation and fibrinolysis were activated in TUR-P group. When the resected prostatic weight is large, the risk of coagulopathy may increase."
CD010438,0,3516980,0,Improved method for automated red cell exchange in sickle cell disease.,"An improved method for intermittent-flow erythrocytapheresis in patients with sickle cell disease is reported. The method, a modification of the standard red cell exchange procedure for the Haemonetics 30S unit, dilutes with physiologic saline the patient's blood as it flows from the draw line and before it reaches the centrifugation bowl. The blood dilution (approximately 1.6 parts saline to 1 part blood) is used only during the first two passes, when the proportion of sickle erythrocytes in the patient's blood is still high. Only that amount of bowl supernatant (saline-diluted plasma) necessary to maintain extracorporeal volume below 500 ml is returned to the patient. The method described largely prevents the clumping of sickle erythrocytes in the centrifugation bowl, a complication frequently encountered with the Haemonetics 30S unit. Thus, changing the bowl between passes is avoided. Furthermore, the sickle red cells can be collected with the first pass and cryopreserved for possible future uses including the option of autotransfusion."
CD010438,0,20092278,0,One-step detection of galectins on hybrid monolayer surface with protruding lactoside.,"Galectins, or beta-galactoside binding lectins, are detected deep in tumor tissue and are recognized as diagnostic and prognostic markers of cancer and other serious diseases. There is a need to develop a faster, easier, and simpler method for detecting galectins. We have succeeded in forming a mixed self-assembled monolayer (SAM) interface consisting of beta-galactoside terminated alkanethiol (lactoside protuberant dodecanethiol) and tri(ethylene glycol) (TEG) terminated short alkanethiol, which proved to be a superior protein resistant material, to enable us to develop a label-free, one-step, and highly sensitive system for detecting the expected biomarker, galectin. We successfully detected nanomolar level (~ 1 nM) galectin-4 and -8 on a 4% lactoside protrusive surface, even though the affinity between the galectins and lactoside was very weak (KD = 1 x 10(-3)~1 x 10(-6)). The combination of the suppression of background noise by filling with TEG terminated short alkanethiol and control of the ligand ratio in the interface contributed to the highly sensitive detection of galectin. We also detected galectin-4 at subten nanomolar levels even in a solution containing much higher concentrations of serum proteins (1800 times larger than the galectin concentration) without using molecule labeling or an immunological method."

CD010438,0,16476097,0,Acquired haemophilia: dynamic whole blood coagulation utilized to guide haemostatic therapy.,"Acquired haemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder caused by autoimmune antibodies interacting with factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX. Anticipating a high degree of heterogeneity amongst cases, we recently initiated systematic recording of whole blood (WB) coagulation dynamic profiles using our recently developed thrombelastographic method employing very small amounts of tissue factor for activation. Six newly diagnosed patients with acquired haemophilia A in our University Hospital were investigated with the purpose to characterize the WB clotting phenotypes in each patient, as well as inspecting the ex vivo and in vivo response to supplementation with various haemostatic agents. Our results show a striking heterogeneity in patients WB clotting profiles, each patient having a particular pattern and an individual type of response to bypassing agents. Profiles in some of patients resembled severe haemophilia A, even if there was a measurable residual FVIII:C activity while others were more similar moderate-to-mild haemophilia. In one case the profile was very close to normal. Each patient seemed to respond individually to bypassing agents. WB clotting profiles assisted us in selecting an optimal treatment modality in each case and whenever possible, we compared the clinical effects of the treatment selected with the appearance of the WB clotting pattern. In one patient, the ex vivo response to FVIII looked promising, and a approximately 200 IU kg-1 per 24 h high-dose programme nearly normalized the clotting profile in 2-week time. Our preliminary small series of data should be concluded with caution. However, it seems that WB clotting profile studies at baseline, with ex vivo addition of haemostasis promoting agents, and during treatment may hold the potential to predict the success of treatment."
CD010438,0,9085950,0,Functional maturity of the coagulation system in children: an evaluation using thrombelastography.,"There are quantitative deficiencies in the coagulation system for at least the first 6 mo of life. Clinical experience, however, does not indicate an increased risk of excessive bleeding during surgical procedures. Thrombelastography, a test providing a functional evaluation of coagulation, was used to assess the hemostatic system of pediatric patients under 2 yr of age. Thrombelastographic data were obtained from 237 healthy pediatric patients less than 2 yr of age undergoing elective noncardiac surgery. Five groups were distinguished: under 30 days, 1-3 mo, 3-6 mo, 6-12 mo, and 12-24 mo. Thrombelastography revealed no defects in coagulation when these groups were compared to each other or to adults, indicating a functionally intact hemostatic process even in neonates. Indeed, children less than 12 mo of age were found to initiate and develop clot faster than adults, with the coagulation process slowing to adult rates after 1 yr of age. In addition to defining functional integrity, our data represents a set of pediatric control thrombelastographic values that have not been previously reported and that may become important in understanding coagulation changes that accompany disease states and surgery in pediatric patients."

Use of the Haemonetics Model 30 blood cell separator, exchanging two liters of plasma with 5% albumin in Hartmann's solution has provided a safe, effective but relatively expensive procedure, capable of producing a marked reduction of fibrinogen, complement components, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody and immune complex concentrations.

CD010438,0,17982317,0,Thrombin-activated thrombelastography for evaluation of thrombin interaction with thrombin inhibitors.,"For intravenous anticoagulation, heparin has been the mainstay drug, but its use may be contraindicated in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. Heparin alternatives including direct thrombin inhibitors are available, but clotting assays (e.g. partial thromboplastin time) measure the time required to form fibrin gel when only a small amount of thrombin is generated. It was hypothesized that the extent of thrombin inhibition varies among inhibitors, and thrombin-activated thrombelastography would provide useful data on therapeutic responses to thrombin inhibitors. Thrombin was added (0-100 nmol/l final concentration) to nonrecalcified whole blood to evaluate clot formation on thrombelastography. Effects of direct thrombin inhibitors (argatroban 3.75 microg/ml, bivalirudin 15 microg/ml, and lepirudin 3.0 microg/ml), and heparin cofactor II activator and dermatan disulfate (20 microg/ml) were evaluated in the presence of 100 nmol/l thrombin. The interactions of thrombin and respective inhibitors were also compared by fluorogenic thrombin substrate cleavage. Increasing concentrations of thrombin progressively shortened the lag time and increased viscoelasticity on thrombelastography. Only 20 nmol/l thrombin caused instantaneous clotting, but maximal viscoelastic force was obtained at 50-100 nmol/l thrombin. All thrombin inhibitors prolonged the lag time (lepirudin > bivalirudin > argatroban = dermatan disulfate), but full recovery of thrombelastography viscoelasticity was observed with argatroban and bivalirudin. Lepirudin abrogated clotting, and dermatan disulfate suppressed clot development on thrombelastography. Thrombin substrate cleavage was observed only for bivalirudin, and heparin cofactor II without dermatan disulfate. The modified thrombelastography technique using nonrecalcified whole blood may be useful in evaluating the extent and reversibility of thrombin blockade with direct or indirect thrombin inhibitors."

We evaluated the sensitivity of various point-of-care platelet function tests for the detection of platelet inhibition induced by nonopioid analgesic drugs. After Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent, citrated whole blood from 40 patients with chronic unspecific low back pain was investigated before and 30 min after intravenous infusion of the study medication consisting of diclofenac 75 mg (plus orphenadrin 30 mg; Neodolpasse; Fresenius Kabi Austria GmbH, Austria), parecoxib 40 mg (Dynastat; Pharmacia Europe EEIG, UK), paracetamol 1 g (Perfalgan; Bieffe Medital S.P.A., Italy), or normal saline in a randomized, cross-over, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Platelet function was assessed using the PFA-100 platelet function analyzer and thromboelastometry, as well as impedance aggregometry (in the last 17 patients recruited after it became commercially available). Sensitivity for detecting diclofenac-induced platelet inhibition was 85% for the PFA-100 using epinephrine as agonist and 94% for arachidonic acid-induced impedance aggregometry. ADP-induced platelet function tests, as well as cytochalasin D-modified thromboelastometry were unreliable. All tests had a low incidence of false-positive test results after normal saline. Paracetamol and parecoxib had no significant platelet inhibiting effect. The PFA-100 using epinephrine as agonist and arachidonic acid-induced impedance aggregometry are recommended for the detection of cyclooxygenase-I-inhibiting effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac. Our findings confirm that a single rescue dose of paracetamol and parecoxib has no antiplatelet effect."

Advocates have suggested a possible role in managing obstetric haemorrhage. This study aims to develop a pregnancy-specific thrombelastography-guided transfusion algorithm, which could be integrated into the management of postpartum haemorrhage. In this prospective observational study, 57 healthy, term-parturients provided pre-caesarean whole blood specimens for thrombelastography analyses. Specimens were processed according to a standardised protocol involving simultaneous analyses using three assays: native (non-activated); kaolin-activated; and kaolin and tissue factor-activated (RapidTEG®). For each assay, the following thrombelastography parameters were measured: reaction time (minutes); clot formation kinetics time (minutes); maximum amplitude (mm); and a angle (degree). Subsequent reference values were used to establish assay-specific reference intervals. For all thrombelastography parameters studied, reference values obtained using a non-activated assay differed from the corresponding values obtained using activated assays, and also demonstrated greater inter-sample variability. From the assay-specific reference intervals obtained, it was possible to establish a pregnancy-specific thrombelastography-guided transfusion algorithm. Specific features of this transfusion algorithm included the preferential use of activated assays, the need for duplicates and a recommendation that an initial baseline thrombelastography measurement is established for subsequent serial comparisons. This transfusion algorithm has been developed to assist with assessment of coagulation and fibrinolytic status during postpartum haemorrhage."

The concern of potential contamination of the blood with viable tumor cells has resulted in limited use of autotransfusion in cancer surgery. The objective of this study was to examine the benefits and safety of autotransfusion in patients undergoing major surgery of genitourinary tumors. Autotransfusion was used in 49 consecutive patients. Twenty-four patients had radical cystectomy, ten had radical prostatectomy, 13 had radical nephrectomy, and two had other types of operations. An autotransfusion machine (Haemonetics Cell Saver) was used. The follow-up included physical examination, chest roentgenogram every three months, and bone scan and computed tomographic scan if clinically indicated. Liver and renal profiles were routinely performed every three months. Five of 49 patients developed metastases during follow-up examination from 12 to 23 months.

CD010438,0,19405329,0,ROTEM analysis: a significant advance in the field of rotational thrombelastography.,"At the turn of the century, a significant advance in the rapidly expanding field of rotational thrombelastography (ROTEG), known at present as thrombelastometry or ROTEM analysis, was developed at the Ludwig-Maximillian University in Munich. The measuring unit is operated by a laptop computer. There are four temperature-controlled measuring channels in which the global assays not only detect coagulation factor defects but also platelet function, abnormal fibrinogen polymerisation, anticoagulant defects and hyperfibrinolysis. ROTEM has steadily increased in popularity, particularly because of its well-established application as a diagnostic aid at the point of care in the critical care situation. It also provides a useful guide in the choice of an appropriate therapeutic option in the bleeding patient, reducing costs by avoiding administration of costly component therapy such as fresh-frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelet concentrates or antifibrinolytic agents. As well as being useful in monitoring anticoagulant therapy and the use of pharmacological agents, ROTEM is a valuable research tool in the field of hypercoagulability, fibrinolysis, factor XIII activity and the ultimate phases of the blood coagulation process."

Pre- and post-procedure cell reductions, specificity of removal, volumes removed, and incidence of adverse reactions were compared. Standard procedures with minor modifications, starch with IF only, and 180 minutes blood processing time were used. The CF system had a significantly lower percent reduction of platelets during TP at 43 +/- 17% than IF at 53 +/- 19%. However, no significant difference was found between CF and IF in percent reduction of white blood cells during TL with 49 +/- 16% and 42 +/- 14%, respectively. The CF system had significantly less hemoglobin reduction (5 +/- 4% vs. 19 +/- 9%, respectively) and white blood cell reduction (13 +/- 15% vs. 27 +/- 17%, respectively) for TP than IF and lower (not significant) hemoglobin reduction (9 +/- 8% vs. 12.4 +/- 8.2%, respectively) as well as platelet reduction (27 +/- 18% vs. 35 +/- 19%, respectively) for TL. CF also had significantly less volume removed than IF during TP (559 +/- 97 vs. 883 +/- 304, respectively) and TL (710 +/- 134 vs. 1405 +/- 421 ml, respectively). Incidence of reactions was lower for CF than IF during TP (8% vs. 10%, respectively) and during TL (14% vs. 21%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

All platelet function and coagulation tests indicated significant dysfunction 15 minutes after protamine neutralization of heparin. With the exception of glass bead adherence, these assays indicated poor recovery of function 1 hour postoperatively. By multiple regression, the most significant predictors of postoperative bleeding were a low body mass index (BMI) (P < 0.0001), lowest core body temperature (P = 0.0006), and cross clamp time (P < 0.0001). Low core temperature was significantly (P < 0.0001) correlated with cross clamp time, which the authors believe is the most likely cause of coagulation and platelet dysfunction. None of the platelet function tests significantly correlated with bleeding. Looking at the highest quartile of chest tube output patients (n = 19) versus the upper and lower 50th percentile of coagulation and platelet function, bleeding could be explained for 11 patients by BMI plus surgery parameters along with coagulation and/or platelet dysfunction. In three cases without negative surgery parameters, coagulation dysfunction was observed. The remaining five cases did not give a clear indication of which parameters were primarily responsible for the bleeding."

CD010438,0,14692073,0,Managing utilization of new diagnostic tests.,"In appropriate utilization of laboratory testing has been estimated to range from 10% to 50% of the volume encountered in hospital laboratories. Many strategies to control utilization of laboratory testing have been reported, including redesigning test requisitions, changing standing orders, the use of provider order entry, physician profiling, and educational initiatives. The major motivation to reduce utilization of unnecessary testing is financial, although other benefits also may be observed, such as reducing false-positive results stemming from testing patients in low prevalence populations, eliminating unnecessary follow-up procedures, avoiding iatrogenic anemia, and potentially lowering hospital length of stay resulting from the need to track down the significance of falsely abnormal tests. The majority of utilization control efforts have focused on reducing routine laboratory tests such as chemistry profiles and automated blood counts. In many hospitals novel diagnostic tests, especially in molecular genetics and oncology, are the major driver behind increasing laboratory costs. Traditional methods to control utilization of routine testing are usually ineffective in controlling testing of novel diagnostic methods. In most cases, test requests originate from a small group of physician specialists who typically are more knowledgeable in their area of expertise than is the clinical pathologist. For this reason, a different approach is generally required. It is particularly important to establish an institutional structure authorized to review and approve new laboratory tests. The clinical pathologist usually takes the lead in this effort because laboratory-based physicians are familiar with new tests being requested by physicians across a spectrum of medical specialties. To be successful, the laboratory physician must identify potential utilization issues, acquire and analyze data, function on interdepartmental teams, and develop strategies to satisfy the needs of clinicians while at the same time preventing introduction of inappropriate technologies into the laboratory. This article will give a perspective on approaches to laboratory test utilization and offer specific examples of initiatives we have undertaken in our institution. The examples will illustrate how the pathologist can use knowledge of medicine and the clinical laboratory in conjunction with organizational and team building skills. In the final analysis, the process is more of an art than a science."
CD010438,0,17010048,0,Global tests of haemostasis in critically ill patients with severe sepsis syndrome compared to controls.,"Haemostatic changes in septic patients are complex, with both procoagulant and anticoagulant changes. Thirty-eight patients with severe sepsis and 32 controls were investigated by coagulation screens, individual factor assays, calibrated automated thrombography (CAT), whole blood low-dose-tissue factor activated (LD-TFA) Rotem and LD-TFA waveform analysis. Thirty-six of 38 patients had an abnormal coagulation screen. The mean levels of factors II, V (P < 0.05), VII, X, XI and XII, antithrombin and protein C (P < 0.01) was decreased in sepsis compared with controls. The mean factor VIII and fibrinogen level (P < 0.001) was increased. CAT in platelet rich and poor plasma showed a prolonged lag time (P < 0.02), decreased peak thrombin (P < 0.02) and delayed time to peak thrombin (P < 0.001) in sepsis patients, however, the endogenous thrombin potential was equivalent in sepsis and controls. In LD-TFA Rotem, septic patients had delayed clot times (P = 0.04) but an increased maximum velocity of clot formation (P < 0.01) and area under the clot elasticity curve (P < 0.01). LD-TFA waveform analysis showed a delayed onset time but an increased rate of clot formation (P < 0.005). In conclusion, global tests of haemostasis suggest that in this patient group, activation of haemostasis is delayed but once initiated thrombin generation and clot formation are normal or enhanced."

CD010438,0,12871465,0,Whole blood coagulation thrombelastographic profiles employing minimal tissue factor activation.,"We investigated whole blood coagulation by thrombelastography (TEG) employing activation with minute amounts of tissue factor (TF). Continuous raw data captured were transformed into novel parameters, such as the maximum velocity (MaxVel) and the time to maximum velocity (t,MaxVel) of whole blood clot formation. The courses of the whole blood clot development were very similar to thrombin generation curves reported in plasma. In this assay healthy women (n = 30) showed an earlier onset and an increased coagulation velocity compared to healthy men (n = 30). In patients with severe hemophilia, and persons undergoing thromboprophylaxis, distinctly abnormal coagulation profiles were observed with a decrease in the MaxVel, as well as a prolonged t,MaxVel. Changes appeared to be dependent on the nature and severity of the hemostatic deficit. Preliminary studies in patients substituted with recombinant factor VIIa demonstrated a marked change in the coagulation profile, in which the MaxVel and t,MaxVel shifted towards normal in a dose-dependent way. Data suggest that the whole blood coagulation TEG profile, following activation with minute amounts of TF, may reflect the hemostatic potential in patients suspected of impaired hemostasis."

Prior investigators have used either arterial or venous samples of blood for TEG measurements. We conducted this prospective cohort study to determine potential differences in TEG variables between arterial and venous blood samples. Arterial and venous samples were drawn from 40 cardiac surgical patients, yielding 134 pairs for comparison. Twenty-nine comparisons (control) were between arterial and arterial samples and were not significantly different. For the arterial and venous comparisons (n = 105), mean (+/-sd) arterial and venous values were the following: reaction time, 10 +/- 2 mm vs 13 +/- 4 mm, P = 0.004; maximum amplitude, 59 +/- 9 mm vs 49 +/- 12 mm, P < 0.001; alpha angle, 61 +/- 10 degrees vs 51 +/- 14 degrees, P < 0.001; K, 5 +/- 2 mm vs 8 +/- 4 mm, P = 0.007; and lysis, 2.5 +/- 1.7 vs 2.5 +/- 2.0 (not significant), arterial versus venous, respectively. Arterial blood samples demonstrated TEG values reflecting stronger (larger maximum amplitude) and faster (shorter reaction time and K value, wider alpha angle) clot formation. The results suggest that users of TEG coagulation analyzers should be consistent with the site of blood sampling given the potential differences obtained."

The blood coagulation system was normal in the patients prior to the surgery. According to the content of adhesion molecules, there were two groups of patients: 1) those with their normal levels and 2) those with their elevated ones. Following the surgery, all the patients developed a hypercoagulation reaction in the blood coagulation system. In the patients with the normal baseline level of adhesion molecules, the latter were higher after endoprosthetic replacement and in those with their elevated baseline levels, the latter were lower."
CD010438,0,10460568,0,The effects of ropivacaine hydrochloride on coagulation and fibrinolysis. An assessment using thromboelastography.,"Amide local anaesthetics impair coagulation by inhibition of platelet function and enhanced fibrinolysis. The potential therefore exists that the presence of amide local anaesthetics in the epidural space could contribute to the therapeutic failure of an epidural autologous blood patch. Ropivacaine is an aminoamide local anaesthetic increasingly used for epidural analgesia and anaesthesia, particularly in obstetric practice. This study was undertaken to investigate whether concentrations of ropivacaine in blood, which could occur clinically in the epidural space, alter coagulation or fibrinolysis. Thromboelastography was used to assess clotting and fibrinolysis of blood to which ropivacaine had been added. Although modest alterations in maximum amplitude, coagulation time and alpha angle were observed, the effect of ropivacaine on clotting and fibrinolysis was not clinically significant. We conclude that it is unlikely that the presence of ropivacaine in the epidural space would reduce the efficacy of an early or prophylactic epidural blood patch."
CD010438,0,20480163,0,Evaluation of coagulation kinetics using thromboelastometry-methodologic influence of activator and test medium.,"Renewed interest has arisen in the use of thromboelastography/thromboelastometry in evaluating coagulation kinetics. The test medium, type of activator, and its concentration may influence the interpretation of coagulation kinetics. This study aimed to investigate methodologic influences of activator and test medium on thromboelastometric parameters of coagulation kinetics. Dynamic clot formation was evaluated by thromboelastometry using whole blood (WB), platelet-rich plasma, or platelet-poor plasma employing different concentrations of extrinsic (tissue factor) and contact activator (synthasil) and with variable concentrations of phospholipids. Plasma samples displayed prolonged clot initiation and enhanced clot propagation compared with WB. Clot firmness was markedly reduced in platelet-poor plasma as compared with platelet-rich plasma and WB. Increasing concentration of activator shortened the clot initiation and increased the velocity of clot propagation, whereas terminal clot firmness remained unaffected. Platelets accelerated clot propagation and raised clot firmness. Phospholipids shortened the time of clot initiation and increased velocity of propagation, while clot firmness remained unchanged. Our results demonstrate that evaluation of coagulation kinetics using thromboelastometry varies according to the composition of the test medium, type, and concentration of activator, as well as the presence and concentration of phospholipids in the test reagent."

CD010438,0,11429335,0,The accuracy of coagulation tests during spinal fusion and instrumentation.,"Patients undergoing major spine surgery may acquire a perioperative coagulopathy from dilution of coagulation factors and/or platelets or fibrinolysis. The mechanisms of the coagulopathy and role of coagulation testing during these procedures are poorly defined. Theoretically, coagulation tests could be used perioperatively to determine which patients are at risk for significant bleeding and guide transfusion therapy. We retrospectively evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of coagulation tests in predicting excessive surgical bleeding in 244 consecutive patients undergoing thoracic, lumbar, or sacral spinal fusion with or without instrumentation. Excessive bleeding was reported by the surgeon in 39 of the patients and was defined as recurrent microvascular bleeding despite adequate use of electrocautery and suture or decreased clot formation of blood pooled within the surgical field. Patients with excessive clinical bleeding sustained larger estimated blood losses than those with normal hemostasis. The total number of allogeneic red blood cells, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma units were also larger in patients with excessive bleeding noted during surgery. The intraoperative coagulation tests with the most sensitivity and specificity were the international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). The INR had a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 88%, and an accuracy of 0.9 at a value of 1.4 (normal, 0.8-1.2). The PT had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 64%, and an accuracy of 0.73 at a value of 13.5 s (normal, 8.4-12.0 s). The aPTT had a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 64%, and an accuracy of 0.71 at a value of 30.9 s (normal, 23-37 s). The thromboelastogram values were of marginal use. We conclude that the INR, PT, and aPTT may be helpful in guiding transfusion therapy in patients undergoing major spine surgery."
CD010438,0,8590850,0,Peripheral blood progenitor cell harvesting in multiple myeloma and malignant lymphoma.,"Peripheral blood progenitor cells are being used increasingly as part of the treatment protocol for a variety of haematological malignancies. The most appropriate mobilisation therapy and the optimum collection procedures have yet to be fully elucidated. 28 patients with myeloma (9), NHL (11) and HD (8) underwent PBSC mobilisation and harvesting between November 1992 and October 1993. Two protocols were used; the myeloma group received high-dose cyclophosphamide, 7 g/m2 + G-CSF and were leucapheresed on 5 consecutive days during the recovery period using the Haemonetics V50 and the lymphoma group a lower dose of cyclophosphamide, 3 g/m2 + G-CSF followed by leucapheresis on 2 or 3 occasions using a Cobe Spectra. Median time to achieve a WBC of 1 x 10(9)/l during the recovery phase, was 14 days (11-16) and 10 days (9-15) respectively. Median numbers of MNC and CFU-GM collected for the myeloma group were 5.9 x 10(8)/kg (2.5-13.5) and 69.4 x 10(4)/kg (9.9-268.1) and for the lymphoma group. 5.1 x 10(8)/kg (1.2-11.1) and 35.4 x 10(4)/kg (1.2-129.7). Three patients with lymphoma had a low yield of CFU-GM, two of which did not proceed to autograft. The third patient failed to engraft and died despite receiving bone marrow backup. For the remaining 25 patients, median time to neuts > 0.5 x 10(9)/l and platelets > 50 x 10(9)/l was 9 (8-13) and 11 (9-23) days for the myeloma group and 12 (9-15) and 13 (9-180) days for the lymphomas. We found a strong correlation between CD34+ cells and CFU-GM from the last 9 patients. There is a correlation between CFU-GM infused and speed of engraftment. All patients who received > 10 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg showed a rapid engraftment for neutrophils and platelets. In all cases, when > 4 x 10(8)/kg MNC were harvested, > 10 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg were obtained. Sufficient cells for a rapid engraftment can be obtained from 2 leucaphereses in the majority of patients. The recovering peripheral blood WBC provides a good indicator of when to harvest. The target value of CFU-GM can be predicted by the number of cells harvested and by the number of CD34 positive cells in the leucapheresis product."

A nanocomposite polymeric material [polyhedral-oligomeric-silsesquioxane-poly(carbonate-urea)urethane; POSS-PCU] demonstrates ideal properties for cardiovascular applications. Silver nanoparticles or nanosilver (NS) are recognized for efficient antibacterial properties. This study aims to determine the influence of NS integrated POSS-PCU on thrombogenicity. Silver nitrate was reduced with dimethylformamide and stabilized by the inclusion of fumed silica nanoparticles to prevent aggregation of NS and were incorporated into POSS-PCU to form a range of POSS-PCU-NS concentrations (by weight); 0.20% (NS16), 0.40% (NS32), 0.75% (NS64), and 1.50% (NS128). Surface wettability was determined with sessile-drop water contact angles. Platelets were introduced onto test samples and Alamar Blue (AB), mitochondrial-activity assay, quantified the degree of platelet adhesion whilst platelet-factor-4 (PF4) ELISA quantified the degree of platelet activation. Thromboelastography (TEG) determined the profiles of whole blood kinetics while hemolysis assay demonstrated the degree of blood compatibility. Increasing levels of NS induced greater hydrophilicity. A concentration dependant decrease in platelet adhesion and activation was observed with AB and PF4 readings, respectively. TEG demonstrated that the antithrombogenic properties of POSS-PCU were retained with POSS-PCU-NS16, and enhanced with POSS-PCU-NS32, but was reduced with POSS-PCU-NS64 and POSS-PCU-NS128. POSS-PCU-NS64 and POSS-PCU-NS128 demonstrated a hemolytic tendency, but no hemolysis was observed with POSS-PCU-NS16 and POSS-PCU-NS32. Overall, POSS-PCU-NS32 rendered potent antithrombogenic properties."

The major hemodynamic changes at the time of reperfusion of the donor liver were significant decreases in arterial blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary artery temperature and significant increases in cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The alterations in laboratory values reflected intraoperative therapeutic manipulations. Citrate toxicity is a concern, and the amount of calcium chloride administered reflected the volume of blood transfused. On reperfusion, the fibrinogen concentration decreased and both the prothrombin time and the activated partial thromboplastin time increased. This coagulopathy was also evident in the thromboelastographic values. Aggressive monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to maintain hemodynamic and metabolic homeostasis in these patients."

Heparin level measurements and their importance in heparin monitoring].,"Measurements of the heparin level were made under continuous anticoagulation in a total of 7 patients. For the purpose of monitoring heparin the coagulation time values were determined parallelly. Except a patient with a sepsis and a 7 days old newborn baby the desired prolongation for the partial thromboplastin time and the reaction time of thrombelastogram resulted from heparin titres lying within the range of 0.2-0.7 U/ml of plasma. Even after applying depot preparations there was a relatively good correspondance of heparin level curves and coagulation parameters. In childhood the partial thromboplastin time is primarily suitable for monitoring the heparin therapy. Heparin half-life times calculated during the transumbilical exchange transfusion in 7 children amounted to values ranging between 40-110 minutes. In addition to checking low dose heparinizing, measurements of the level are suitable for deriving dosage standards for neutralizing heparin effects by protamine sulfate."

Mechanisms involved in this outcome have not been elucidated. We have investigated in vitro the redistribution of rFVIIa in platelets from healthy donors, patients with FVII deficiency, and one patient with Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Platelet-rich plasma was exposed to rFVIIa (3 to 60 μg/mL). Flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and coagulation tests were applied to detect and quantify rFVIIa. The hemostatic effect of rFVIIa associated to platelets was evaluated using perfusion models. Our studies revealed a dose-dependent association of rFVIIa to the platelet cytoplasm with redistribution into the open canalicular system, and α granules. Mechanisms implicated in the internalization are multiple, involve GPIb and GPIV, and require phospholipids and cytoskeletal assembly. After platelet activation with thrombin, platelets exposed rFVIIa on their membrane. Perfusion studies revealed that the presence of 30% of platelets containing FVIIa improved platelet aggregate formation and enhanced fibrin generation (P < 0.01 versus control). Our results indicate that, at therapeutic concentrations, rFVIIa can be internalized into platelets, where it is protected from physiological clearance mechanisms and can still promote hemostatic activity. Redistribution of rFVIIa into platelets may explain the prolonged prophylactic effectiveness of rFVIIa in hemophilia."
CD010438,0,7314222,0,Factors influencing yield of plateletpheresis by discontinuous centrifugation.,"Plateletphereses performed by the Haemonetics Model 30 Blood Processor under a fixed condition were retrospectively analyzed. The mean platelet yield was 5.97 X l0 (ll) (+/- l.46 X l0 (ll). Prepheresis platelet count was significantly correlated to platelet yield (p less than 0.001), but hematocrit was not (p greater than 0.1). Blood-drawing time showed a significant correlation (p less than 0.01) and may suggest than an infusion rate of 60 ml/minute is a technique of choice. A large number of platelets (% platelet recovery = 73.0 +/- l4.l%) was discarded in order to remove erythrocytes and leukocytes from the initial product. The recovery was negatively correlated to the percentage removal of leukocytes (p less than 0.01), which means that a platelet product of good quality not containing leukocytes can be prepared at the sacrifice of a large quantity of platelets. It is desirable to devise a simple and practical technique to obtain pure platelets without loss."

He was started on a l3-day course of daily granulocyte transfusions obtained by intermittent-flow leukapheresis (haemonetics Model 30 [Braintree, Massachusetts]) utilizing hydroxyethyl starch. Each transfusion contained an average of 9 X l0(9) granulocytes. He defervesced on the seventh transfusion day, and the sedimentation rate returned to normal on the thirteenth transfusion day. Radionuclide scan showed decrease in size of the liver abscesses. No other new therapeutic modalities were attempted during the period of granulocyte transfusion. Although the use of granulocyte transfusion has been suggested to treat infections in CGD, we report the first successful use of granulocyte transfusion therapy in S. aureus abscess disease in CGD. Granulocyte transfusions may be helpful in treating infections refractory to standard medical-surgical management in patients with CGD and other disorders of neutrophil function."

CD010438,0,22483776,0,Challenges in the laboratory analyses of bleeding disorders.,"Standard coagulation assays such as the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time are sufficient to detect deficiencies in coagulation factors contributing to the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, respectively. Deficiencies in factors VIII and IX can also be detected by one-stage and two-stage clotting assays. While these assays are instrumental in assessing the initiation of clot formation, sufficient formation of a clot is a continuous process that may be better studied by the use of a global hemostasis assay. Several global assays are currently being studied, including the thrombin generation assay, thromboelastography, clot waveform analysis, clot formation and lysis (CloFAL) assay, euglobulin clot lysis assay, thromboplastin generation assays and simultaneous thrombin and plasmin generation assays. This review will concentrate on the thrombin generation test, thromboelastography, the activated partial thromboplastin time waveform analysis and the CloFAL which measure the production of thrombin, as well as the kinetics of clot formation. As such, these global assays can provide greater insight into deficiencies in the mechanisms mediating hemostasis and fibrinolysis in patients with hemophilia, other bleeding disorders or even thrombophilia. These assays have been shown to be clinically relevant for assessing the response to treatment with bypassing agents (recombinant activated FVII and plasma-derived prothrombin complex concentrate) used for the hemostatic control of acute bleeding in patients with congenital hemophilia A/B. The limitations of standard coagulation assays and the use of global hemostasis assays to assess bleeding disorders and the clinical efficacy of bypassing agents will be discussed in detail."

CD010438,0,16551936,0,A head-to-head comparison of the in vitro coagulation effects of saline-based and balanced electrolyte crystalloid and colloid intravenous fluids.,"Both fluid composition (e.g., type of hydroxyethyl starch) and formulation (e.g., saline or balanced salt carrier solution) may alter whole blood coagulation. We therefore enrolled 10 healthy volunteers to test ex vivo, thrombelastograph-based blood coagulation differences of eight crystalloid and colloid solutions at 20%, 40%, and 60% dilutions. Saline and lactated Ringer's solution produced a hypercoagulable state at 20%-40% dilutions. Saline, hetastarch in saline, pentastarch in saline, tetrastarch in saline, and human albumin solutions all produced a hypocoagulable state at 60% dilution. Hetastarch in saline also produced a hypocoagulable state at 40% dilution. The larger molecular weight starches produced more intense coagulation abnormalities than the medium molecular weight compounds formulated similarly (i.e., suspended in saline or balanced salt solution). The balanced salt solutions caused fewer coagulation abnormalities, especially pentastarch in balanced salt solution. This balanced salt pentastarch preparation produced the least derangement of coagulation of the colloid solutions at all dilutions, causing hypercoagulability at the lower dilutions and minimal coagulation derangement at 60% dilution. These data support the theory that smaller molecular weight hydroxyethyl starches and colloids suspended in balanced salt solutions preserve coagulation better than large molecular weight starches and saline-based colloids, as judged by thrombelastography."
CD010438,0,17483700,0,High availability of intravascular tissue factor in neonates.,"In the present study, we compared the levels of intravascular tissue factor (TF) present in cord versus adult whole blood (WB) prior and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. High levels of intravascular TF might help to explain the clinically observed efficient clotting of cord blood despite low levels of procoagulatory factors. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed same (basal) TF mRNA expression levels in both native cord and adult WB, and approximately same increase in TF mRNA expression owing to LPS incubation in both cord and adult WB (normalized to the housekeeping gene beta-actin). Flow-cytometric (fluorescence activated cell sorting) analysis revealed significantly higher surface TF antigen exposure on the neonatal monocyte membrane in native WB samples, and approximately same ability of neonatal and adult monocytes to express TF upon LPS-stimulation. Thrombelastography revealed significantly shorter clotting times of native cord versus adult WB (527+/-41 vs. 592+/-23 s, P<0.05). Moreover, shortening of clotting times owing to LPS-stimulation was significantly more pronounced in cord versus adult WB (29.65+/-3.35% vs. 12.03+/-6.23%, P<0.05). Because both quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis revealed same capability of both neonatal and adult monocytes to express TF upon LPS-stimulation, this efficient shortening effect in cord WB might be explained by the constitutively high number of monocytes present in neonates. We suggest that the high levels of intravascular TF present in neonates (prior and after LPS-stimulation) might help to explain the clinically observed efficient clotting of cord blood despite low levels of procoagulatory factors."

CD010438,0,18437714,0,The influence of sex hormones on coagulation and inflammation in the trauma patient.,"Recent clinical studies have shown a sex dimorphism of morbidity and mortality due to shock, trauma, and sepsis, with females tolerating these insults better than males. Experimental animal studies have suggested that sex hormones have a pivotal role in this dimorphism. In the present investigation, a prospective cohort study at a university level-1 trauma center was conducted to evaluate the association between sex hormones and alterations in coagulation and inflammation. Patients with an admission to the intensive care unit, injury severity score (ISS) greater than 4, and obtainable consent were included in the study. In addition to routine clinical laboratories and patient outcomes, plasma TNF-[alpha], IL-6, IL-8, estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone were measured. Sixty-two patients (71% men, 29% women) met criteria for entry. Mean age was 42 +/- 17 years, and mean ISS was 23 +/- 13, with no statistical difference in age or ISS between sexes. Estradiol levels were positively correlated with ISS (P < 0.05) and negatively correlated with TNF-[alpha] (P < 0.01). Initial estradiol levels were higher in patients who developed an infection (P < 0.05). Testosterone was negatively correlated with age (P < 0.01) and was higher in patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (P < 0.05) and in patients who did not survive (P < 0.05). The estradiol-to-progesterone ratio (E2-Pr) was higher in the survivors (P < 0.05). The E2-Pr had positive correlations with fibrinogen levels, rate of fibrin deposition and cross-linking, and overall clot strength (P < 0.05). Estradiol-to-progesterone ratio was negatively correlated with partial thromboplastin times (P < 0.01). In men, the E2-Pr was also negatively correlated with the time to onset of clot formation (P = 0.03). Sex hormone levels (or their ratios) were not correlated to platelet count or international normalized ratios. These findings provide evidence that sex hormone levels in the early posttraumatic period are significantly associated with alterations in the hemostatic and inflammatory response to trauma."

We evaluate 30 preoperative patients taking diclofenac (group D) by routine coagulation screen, platelet count, fibrinogen concentration, thrombelastography, and PFA-100 (Dade Behring, Inc, Deerfield, IL)) platelet function analyzer. Ten patients (group P) and 30 healthy volunteers (group N) not taking NSAIDs serve as control. Diclofenac causes significant prolongation of mean PFA-100 closure times (P < .0001). However, the prolongation is highly variable; and up to 33% of patients are still having normal platelet function despite diclofenac consumption. Low body weight is a significant predictor of more severe platelet dysfunction (P < .01). Other tests are not useful. We conclude that not all patients taking NSAIDs have similar platelet dysfunction and that preoperative monitoring with PFA-100 is preferable."
CD010438,0,9249097,0,Does the platelet-activated clotting test (HemoSTATUS) predict blood loss and platelet dysfunction associated with cardiopulmonary bypass?,"Platelet dysfunction is a major cause of bleeding after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). No timely, simple, point-of-care determinant of platelet function is available for clinical use. Adding platelet-activating factor to conventional activated clotting time methods (platelet-activated clotting test [PACT]) (HemoSTATUS; Medtronic, Inc., Parker, CO) produces rapid results (<3 min) and may yield a measure of platelet responsiveness and whole blood procoagulant activity. Blood samples were drawn for PACT, platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and thromboelastogram (TEG) from 200 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The PACT significantly decreased from the baseline to postprotamine time interval (P < 0.001). The PACT correlated with 4-h mediastinal blood loss (r = -0.30, P = 0.014). The TEG maximum amplitude also correlated with 4-h mediastinal blood loss (r = -0.32, P = 0.003). The PACT had a sensitivity and specificity comparable to routine laboratory coagulation tests in predicting blood loss. The TEG maximum amplitude, however, was more predictive than both the PACT and routine coagulation tests in this respect. The PACT may be a useful indicator of platelet responsiveness or whole blood procoagulant activity, but we did not find it superior to other tests of coagulation function for predicting excessive blood loss after CPB."

CD010438,0,21312255,0,Plasma extraction rate and collection efficiency during therapeutic plasma exchange with Spectra Optia in comparison with Haemonetics MCS+.,"For therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), continuous and intermittent flow separators are known to be efficient. This study was undertaken to compare the performances of the Spectra Optia, a continuous flow centrifugal apheresis system recently developed by CaridianBCT, with the Haemonetics Multicomponents System (MCS)+ apheresis system based on intermittent flow centrifugation. The primary objective of the study was to compare the time required to exchange one total plasma volume with both separators. The secondary objectives were to determine the plasma exchange efficiency, the plasma extraction rate, the percentage of target exchange volume achieved, and the loss of cellular components. The study involved prospectively paired comparison of 16 TPE on each device performed in patients with chronic diseases treated with TPE. The time required to exchange 1 total plasma volume was 182 ± 36 minutes for MCS+ procedures and 100 ± 20 minutes for the Spectra Optia procedures (P < 0.05, all results presented as mean ± standard deviation). A significantly higher plasma extraction rate was achieved (30.2 ± 4.3 vs 16.8 ± 3.4 mL/min, respectively, P < 0.05), and the plasma exchange efficiency was slightly better with the Spectra Optia compared with the MCS+ procedures (83.4 ± 7.0 vs 80.0 ± 8.5%, P < 0.05). The platelet loss was significantly lower with the Spectra Optia compared with the MCS+ procedures (1.6 ± 2.3 vs 7.5 ± 4.2%, respectively, P < 0.05), whereas the red blood cells loss was comparable. In conclusion, the Spectra Optia has significantly higher extraction rate and exchange efficiency than the MCS+ allowing to remove the same amount of plasma in less time, by processing less blood. It also removes significantly less platelets than the MCS+ separator."

CD010438,0,1188710,0,The influence of beta-adrenergic blockade upon baseline blood coagulation and fibrinolytic activity and upon the responses to venous occlusion.,"Twenty volunteers were assessed for baseline coagulation (Thrombelastography, Factor VIII and platelet count) and fibrinolytic (Euglobulin Lysis Time and Fibrin(ogen) Degradation Products) activity two hours after ingestion of 60 mgm propranolol or an identical placebo administered on a double blind basis. The responses of these parameters to a fifteen minute period of venous occlusion was also assessed. Beta adrenergic blockade reduced baseline FDP titres but did not affect other parameters, nor the local response to venous occlusion. During occlusion no significant change in coagulation activity could be detected in the non-occluded arm, but a small but statistically significant shortening of ELT was observed. Since this effect was prevented by propranolol it is probably mediated through adrenergic mechanisms. Adrenergic stimuli appear to influence episodes of coagulation and fibrinolysis during everyday activity, but do not contribute to baseline levels of coagulation or fibrinolytic function."

After three days of postwash storage at 4 C, nonrejuvenated red blood cells had a mean 24-hour posttransfusion survival of 88 per cent, and outdated-rejuvenated red blood cells a value of 81 per cent. This new system is simpler and safer than methods previously used in this laboratory, and red blood cell recovery and 24-hour posttransfusion survivals were comparable or better."
CD010438,0,22926249,0,"Obstetric hemorrhage and coagulation: an update. Thromboelastography, thromboelastometry, and conventional coagulation tests in the diagnosis and prediction of postpartum hemorrhage.","Globally, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. In the current treatment of severe PPH, first-line therapy includes transfusion of packed cells and fresh-frozen plasma in addition to uterotonic medical management and surgical interventions. In persistent PPH, tranexamic acid, fibrinogen, and coagulation factors are often administered. Secondary coagulopathy due to PPH or its treatment is often underestimated and therefore remains untreated, potentially causing progression to even more severe PPH. In most cases, medical and transfusion therapy is not based on the actual coagulation state because conventional laboratory test results are usually not available for 45 to 60 minutes. Thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry are point-of-care coagulation tests. A good correlation has been shown between thromboelastometric and conventional coagulation tests, and the use of these in massive bleeding in nonobstetric patients is widely practiced and it has been proven to be cost-effective. As with conventional laboratory tests, there is an influence of fluid dilution on coagulation test results, which is more pronounced with colloid fluids. Fibrinogen seems to play a major role in the course of PPH and can be an early predictor of the severity of PPH. The FIBTEM values (in thromboelastometry, reagent specific for the fibrin polymerization process) decline even more rapidly than fibrinogen levels and can be useful for early guidance of interventions. Data on thromboelastography and thromboelastometry in pregnant women are limited, particularly during the peripartum period and in women with PPH, so more research in this field is needed."

In the present prospective trial, blood samples were drawn before valproate therapy, after 6 weeks of therapy, after more than 6 weeks and after longer than 6 months of valproate therapy from 23 children newly treated with valproate. Two children developed thrombocytopenia, and six children with initial normal von Willebrand factor showed acquired von Willebrand's disease. Fibrinogen levels dropped below the lower limit in 12 patients and subnormal factor XIII plasma levels were observed in 17% of patients. No patient developed signs of hemorrhage. Eight percent of patients developed valproate-induced thrombocytopenia. Reduction in platelets did not reach statistic significance. Thrombelastography showed a 47% incidence of altered platelet function. We found a statistically significant, positive correlation between clotting time of collagen extrinsic pathway inhibitor and, accordingly, adenosindiphosphate and valproate level. Plasmatic coagulation investigations showed a significant decrease of prothrombin time. Activated partial thromboplastin time measurements also showed significant prolongation with valproate. Activity of von Willebrand factor antigen and von Willebrand factor ristocetin cofactor significantly decreased. Factor XIII activity significantly decreased after valproate therapy for longer than 6 months (17% of children). Fibrinogen was significantly reduced. In the coagulatory system a decrease in the main antiprotease antithrombin III activity was observed. Blood coagulation disturbances are common in patients with valproate, but rarely become clinically symptomatic. Acquired von Willebrand's disease and hypofibrinogenemia may become relevant in patients with surgery or trauma. Particular attention should be paid to factor-XIII deficiency, which is especially seen with valproate therapy."

After a review of the current literature, to our knowledge, no case of metallic debris has been reported in the blood after complete treatment with the Haemonetics Cell Saver (Braintree, MA) and appropriate filter system. A case of total hip revision of a loose, cemented acetabular component with a commercially pure titanium metal backing and a titanium alloy plasma-spray textured surface was undertaken. The titanium alloy femoral component was not visibly loose and was not revised. The joint lining tissues were black. Throughout the procedure, the operative site was suctioned with a double-lumen heparinized catheter that delivered blood and other materials to a Haemonetics Cell Saver 3 Plus. The reservoir and filter unit used were the compatible Bentley BCR-3500 (Baxter, Irvine, CA), a system capable of filtering particulates down to 20 microns. Prior to infusion of the salvaged blood, many large black clumps of material were observed mixed in the blood. Some measured 10 x 5 x 5 mm and could easily be seen macroscopically. Light microscopy demonstrated red blood cells with intermixed neutrophils, and black foreign material scattered as separate particles and within the cytoplasm of the scattered histiocytes. Energy dispersive analysis of the black material confirmed the composition as primarily titanium with minute quantities of copper, iron, phosphorous, and sulfur. A scanning electron photomicrograph of one of the specimens demonstrated a large conglomerate, approximately 2,000 microns in diameter, composed primarily of titanium and organic material.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

However, patients with atherosclerosis or cancer have been reported to have TF concentrations ranging between 800 and 9000 pg/mL. Of interest, thrombelastographic (TEG)-based measures of clot initiation and propagation have demonstrated hypercoagulability in such patients at risk for thromboembolic events. Thus, our goal in the present investigation was to establish a concentration-response relationship of the effect of TF on TEG variables, and determine specificity of TF-mediated events with a monoclonal TF antibody."
CD010438,0,18069872,0,Controlled release of chol-TEG-DNA from Nano- and micropatterned SU-8 surfaces by a spreading lipid film.,"We report the controlled release of immobilized cholesteryl-tetraethyleneglycol-DNA (chol-DNA) from micropatterned SU-8 surfaces by a spreading lipid film. The release of chol-DNA is rapid and on the order of the spreading rate of the lipid film beta = 1-3 microm2/s ( approximately 10(5) molecules of DNA per second). The lipid film serves as a poor solvent for the DNA adduct, which upon contact redistributes into the aqueous phase. Thus, the release of DNA is accompanied by a change in surface hydrophobicity. The method can be used for creating arbitrary concentration profiles of DNA in solution over time or to dynamically change surface properties on demand in, for example, micro- and nanofluidic devices. Examples of DNA release from spiral, comb, meander, and triangular as well as from nanoscale SU-8 lanes are shown."

In this study we compare the thrombelastographic measurements with six common tests (the hematocrit, platelet count, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, activated thromboplastin time and fibrin split products). For such comparisons, two samples of subjects were selected, 141 normal volunteers and 121 patients with cancer. The data was subjected to various statistical techniques such as correlation, ANOVA, canonical and discriminant analysis to measure the extent of the correlations between the two sets of variables and their relative strength to detect blood clotting abnormalities. The results indicate that, although there is a strong relationship between the thrombelastographic variables and these common laboratory tests, the thrombelastographic variables contain additional information on the hemostatic process."

CD010438,0,19718472,0,Serotonergic mechanisms enhance platelet-mediated thrombogenicity.,"Although it is generally acknowledged that serotonin (5-HT) is a weak agonist for human platelets, recent information suggests an association between serotonergic mechanisms and cardiovascular risk. We investigated the action of 5-HT on adhesive, cohesive and procoagulant properties of human platelets. Impact of 5-HT on whole blood coagulation and thrombin generation was measured by modified thromboelastometry (TEM) and specific fluorogenic assays. We evaluated the effects of 5-HT on thrombus formation in an in-vitro model of thrombosis using human flowing blood. In platelet-rich plasma (PRP), 5-HT favoured the expression of CD62-P, and procoagulant molecules on platelet membranes. These effects were potentiated in the presence of Ca(++) and/or ADP. Incubation with 5-HT accelerated clotting times and augmented clot strength in whole blood TEM, and enhanced thrombin generation in PRP. In perfusion studies, 5-HT significantly increased fibrin deposition at low shear (300s(-1)) and enhanced platelet thrombus formation on the damaged vascular surface at high shear (1,200s(-1)). Selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake (SSRI) attenuated effects of 5-HT on platelet activation and downregulated the prothrombotic tendencies observed in the previous experimental conditions. In general, reductions of thrombogenic patterns observed with SSRI were more evident under shear conditions (aggregation and perfusion systems) and less evident under steady conditions (TEM and thrombin generation assays). In conclusion, 5-HT is not a weak agonist for human platelets; instead it accentuates platelet activation, potentiates procoagulant responses on human blood and increases thrombogenesis on damaged vascular surfaces. The remarkable antithrombotic actions achieved through SSRI deserve further mechanistic and clinical investigations."
CD010438,0,22024794,0,Carbon monoxide and nitric oxide modulate α₂-antiplasmin and plasmin activity: role of heme.,"Cigarette smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) released from tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer (CORM-2) attenuate fibrinolysis. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether CO diminished fibrinolysis by enhancement of α₂-antiplasmin via a putative heme group. Plasma, isolated α₂-antiplasmin and isolated plasmin were exposed to CO released from CORM-2 and nitric oxide (NO) via a NO donor to induce carboxyheme and metheme states, respectively. Exposed, isolated enzymes were placed in either α₂-antiplasmin-deficient or normal plasma. Effects of CO and NO on tissue-type plasminogen activator initiated fibrinolysis were determined by thrombelastography. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to identify heme released from α₂-antiplasmin and plasmin. CO significantly enhanced α₂-antiplasmin activity, but decreased plasmin activity. NO decreased both α₂-antiplasmin and plasmin activity. Although inadequate LC-MS/MS data were obtained with α₂-antiplasmin (secondary to glycosylation), a putative plasmin-associated heme was identified. CO elicits hypofibrinolysis by enhancing α₂-antiplasmin activity and decreasing plasmin activity. On the basis of the responses to NO and LC-MS/MS data, it is highly likely that both enzymes are modulated by attached heme groups. Efforts to develop methods to detect CO-mediated hypercoagulability are ongoing, with the goal of identifying populations at risk of thrombotic morbidity secondary to cigarette smoking."
CD010438,0,22024795,0,Observational study of fibrinogen concentrate in massive hemorrhage: evaluation of a multicenter register.,"In acute hemorrhage, a critical decrease in fibrinogen often induces acquired coagulopathy. Fibrinogen concentrate has been used to supplement fibrinogen during massive hemorrhage. However, there are limited data on the utilization of fibrinogen concentrate in this setting. This prospective, multicenter observational study analyzed clinical treatment with fibrinogen concentrate in acute bleeding. A prospective multicenter web-based register was developed to document closed cases of massive hemorrhage treated with fibrinogen concentrate perioperatively. Anonymized data including the cause and kinetics of the bleeding, coagulation parameters, coagulation therapy, clinical effects and adverse events were recorded. Two hundred and twenty-three cases entered between September 2008 and August 2009 were eligible for analysis. According to patient needs, additional common blood and coagulation products were administered. Fibrinogen substitution by fibrinogen concentrate and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was initiated at a median blood loss of 2.0 l and plasma fibrinogen of 1.45 g/l. After a median dose of 12.0 g fibrinogen (4 g in fibrinogen concentrate and 8 g in FFP), plasma fibrinogen rose to 2.19 g/l at the end of surgery; corresponding to a median increment of 0.045 g/l per gram of fibrinogen administered. After substitution, 6% of patients had supra-physiological plasma fibrinogen levels. Three percent of patients sustained thromboembolic complications perioperatively. Logistic regression analysis showed positive correlation of postoperative plasma fibrinogen and survival (P < 0.05). Clinical application of fibrinogen concentrate in bleeding patients is included within a multimodal therapeutic concept. High levels of fibrinogen are necessary in order to reach therapeutic goals. In bleeding patients, higher plasma fibrinogen might be associated with higher rates of survival."

A patient with known thrombosis of his splanchnic circulation and visceral KTWS presented with life-threatening hemorrhage from rectosigmoid varices. Portosystemic shunting was not feasible. Endoscopic sclerosis, variceal ligation, and proctocolectomy were not possible due to the size and number of the varices. Previous treatment with epsilon-aminocaproic acid had been unsuccessful and complicated by thrombophlebitis. Conservative treatment with blood transfusions, cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, vitamin K, propanolol, and somatostatin analog failed to stop the bleeding. The patient was given the antifibrinolytic agent, tranexamic acid, with cessation of his hemorrhage. Serial thromboelastograms confirmed improved reaction time, coagulation time, clot formation rate, and maximum amplitude. We conclude that tranexamic acid may be a useful adjunct in the medical treatment of high-risk patients with KTWS and other vascular nevi complicated by coagulopathy."

CD010438,0,15461627,0,The effects of folic acid supplements on coagulation status in pregnancy.,"Thromboembolic disease remains the leading cause of maternal death in the UK. Recent literature has proposed that folate status is a strong predictor for venous thrombosis. Using thrombelastography (TEG((R))), we tested the hypothesis that folic acid supplementation is associated with a reduction in whole blood coagulability. Blood samples and questionnaire data were obtained at a mean gestation of 13.6 weeks (SD: 3.8, range: 6-38 weeks) from unselected consecutive women attending for their antenatal booking scan. Of 588 patients, 439 (74.7%) took folic acid. All TEG((R)) parameters were less hypercoagulable in women that had taken folic acid compared with those that had not: mean maximum amplitude (MA) 60.3 versus 62.1; mean difference 1.8; 95% confidence interval 0.8, 2.8; P = 0.0001; mean coagulation index (CI) 0.54 versus 0.85; mean difference 0.31; 95% confidence interval 0.11, 0.5; P = 0.002. There was no difference in the incidence of the homozygous MTHFR mutation in patients taking folic acid (5.53%) compared with those that were not (4.08%). This study suggests that benefit may be derived from longer-term treatment, although large multicentre studies are required to determine whether the relative hypocoagulability is associated with a reduction in risk of venous thrombosis."

The new rotation thromboelastometry by rotation thrombelastogram has the potential to provide information on whole blood clot formation and prothrombotic state in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis. Rotation thrombelastogram parameters were evaluated in whole blood of 30 patients with a first episode of acute deep vein thrombosis and 40 healthy controls. The effect of factor VIII and fibrinogen levels on rotation thrombelastogram assays was also assessed in the study population and in a model of blood supplemented by increasing amounts of fibrinogen. All assays performed were consistent with a remarkable hypercoagulable profile in deep vein thrombosis patients as compared with controls. In particular, maximum clot firmness and the area under curve values, which are expected to better correlate with the hypercoagulable state in the acute phase of deep vein thrombosis, were significantly higher in patients than in controls. As expected, fibrinogen was shown to be one of the main determinants of the hypercoagulability in rotation thrombelastogram assays. In a small subset of acute deep vein thrombosis patients, inherited thrombophilia had no influence on rotation thrombelastogram parameters. The new rotation thrombelastogram thromboelastometry is a useful tool to detect acute deep vein thrombosis-related hypercoagulability. Prospective studies are needed to define the potential applications of rotation thrombelastogram in the management of deep vein thrombosis patients."
CD010438,0,18440798,0,Impact of spacers on the hybridization efficiency of mixed self-assembled DNA/alkanethiol films.,"The immobilization of DNA strands is an essential step in the development of any DNA biosensor. Self-assembled mixed DNA/alkanethiol films are often used for coupling DNA probes covalently to the sensor surface. Although this strategy is well accepted, the effect of introducing a spacer molecule to increase the distance between the specific DNA sequence and the surface has rarely been assessed. The major goal of this work was to evaluate a number of such spacers and to assess their impact on for example the sensitivity and the reproducibility. Besides the commonly used mercaptohexyl (C(6)) spacer, a longer mercapto-undecyl (C(11)) spacer was selected. The combination of both spacers with tri(ethylene)glycol (TEG) and hexa(ethylene)glycol (HEG) was studied as well. The effect of the different spacers on the immobilization degree as well as on the consecutive hybridization was studied using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). When using the longer C(11) spacer the mixed DNA/alkanethiol films were found to be more densely packed. Further hybridization studies have indicated that C(11) modified probes improve the sensitivity, the corresponding detection limit as well as the reproducibility. In addition two different immobilization pathways, i.e. flow vs. diffusion controlled, were compared with respect to the hybridization efficiency. These data suggest that a flow-assisted approach is beneficial for DNA immobilization and hybridization events. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the considerable impact of spacers on the biosensor performance but also shows the importance of a flow-assisted immobilization approach."

Twenty consecutive patients were evaluated, of whom five were excluded according to protocol criteria. Patients each donated 1 unit blood 14 and 7 days before operation. A third unit was withdrawn in the anaesthetic room and replaced with Hartmann's solution, producing a haemodiluted state. Intraoperative losses were minimized using the Haemonetics Cell Saver III Plus autotransfusion system. Predonated blood from two patients passed its expiry date owing to repeated operation postponements, leaving 13 patients for study. The mean(s.d.) intraoperative blood loss was 700(300) ml with a mean(s.d.) intraoperative salvage of 420(300) ml. Two patients were transfused intraoperative salvage of 420(300) ml.

The present study was performed to assess PCC for treatment of coagulopathy after blunt liver injury under severe hypothermia. Coagulopathy in 14 anaesthetised pigs was induced by haemodilution. Subsequently, standardised blunt liver injury was induced under severe hypothermia (32.8-33.2°C). Animals were randomised to receive either PCC (35 IU kg⁻¹) or saline (control). Coagulation was assessed over the following 2 hours by thromboelastometry and thrombin generation. Internal organs were examined to determine presence of emboli. The administration of PCC showed a significant reduction in blood loss (p=0.002 vs. controls) and a significant increase in the rate of survival (p=0.022 vs. controls). Plasma thrombin generation in the PCC group increased considerably above baseline levels, with significant increases in peak thrombin levels and endogenous thrombin potential versus controls throughout the follow-up period. In addition, PT decreased significantly in the PCC group versus the control group. However, only slight improvements in thromboelastometry variables were observed. Histology showed an equal degree of liver injury in both groups, and no thromboembolism. In severely hypothermic pigs, the application of PCC corrected trauma-induced coagulopathy and reduced blood loss. Thus, the infusion of PCC might be a reasonable approach to reduce the need for blood cell transfusion in trauma. Furthermore, the impact and safety of PCC application can be monitored through thrombin generation and thromboelastometry under hypothermia."
CD010438,0,11375811,0,Hemostatic changes in patients receiving hydroxyethyl starch: the influence of ABO blood group.,"Hydroxyethyl starches (HES) interfere with coagulation because of their molecular structure and the amount infused during surgery. Coagulation defects include platelet dysfunction and a decrease of the VIII/von Willebrand factor complex (VIII/vWF). We examined the effects of 6% HES 200/0.6 on hemostasis by using an in vitro platelet function analyzer, the usual coagulation tests, the VIII/vWF complex assessment, and TEG analysis in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. The influence of the blood group was investigated. HES infusion induced primary hemostasis alterations, assessed by a prolonged platelet function analyzer closure time in the presence of epinephrine and adenosine diphosphate, which was not correlated with the platelet count. The decrease in VIII/vWF complex was proportional to the volume of infused HES (20 and 30 mL/kg) and was more pronounced in patients of the O blood group. The preoperative hypercoagulability status assessed by TEG analysis was reversed 24 h after HES infusion. In conclusion, 6% HES 200/0.6 induced immediate hemostasis alterations. Patients of the O blood group were likely to develop a von Willebrand-like syndrome after HES infusion. We conclude that intraoperative use of 6% HES 200/0.6 should be restricted in patients of the O blood group undergoing surgical procedures with high risk for bleeding."

CD010438,0,7199294,0,[Clinical problems of microrheology in disseminated intravascular coagulation (author's transl)].,"Among the earliest products of a potentially succeeding disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are the soluble fibrin monomer complexes representing a state of hypercoagulability. They are passing microcirculation as long as there are no precipitation activities, which may involve only one single organ. A typical example is the endotoxin shock followed by fibrination of the kidneys. The clogging of microcirculation by fibrination specifically released in this organ or another may be prevented in case of a well-timed diagnosis, but scarcely can be removed therapeutically (possibly therapeutical fibrinolysis). The effects of localising fibrination yet independent of clotting mechanism may be tackled by treating the causal disease. Hypercoagulability always preceding DIC can be controlled mainly by heparin. Its well-timed application depends on diagnostics which are able to define the momentary situation in the mostly progredient process, comprising a mortality of about 50%. Finally, as a possible method to assess the clinical situation the resonance thrombography, a successor of thrombelastography, is put forward."

Therefore, strategies for reducing transfusion of these products during trauma management are valuable. We report a case of severe blunt abdominal trauma, successfully treated with antifibrinolytic medication and fibrinogen concentrate. Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) was used to identify hyperfibrinolysis and afibrinogenaemia. In order to achieve haemostasis, over a 3-h period, the patient received a total of 1 g of tranexamic acid, 7 U of packed red blood cells, 16 g of fibrinogen concentrate (Haemocomplettan P), 3500 ml of colloids and 5500 ml of lactated Ringer's solution. Together with surgical measures, this treatment stopped the bleeding and stabilised the patient. There was no transfusion of either fresh-frozen plasma or platelets. The limited need for allogeneic blood products is of particular interest, and clinical studies of the approach used here appear to be warranted."
CD010438,0,15281495,0,Peroxynitrite decreases hemostasis in human plasma in vitro.,"Coagulopathy has been associated with clinical scenarios that involve reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite (OONO-). Further, OONO- decreases tissue factor and fibrinogen function in vitro. Thus, we hypothesized that exposure of plasma to the OONO- generated with 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), a molecule that produces both nitric oxide and superoxide, would result in a decrease in hemostatic function via diminished coagulation protein activity. Hemostatic function of plasma exposed to SIN-1 (0, 1, 5, and 10 mM for 60 min at 37 degrees C) was assessed with thrombelastography, activated partial thromboplastin time, and prothrombin time in the presence or absence of superoxide dismutase (SOD) or an OONO- scavenger. SIN-1 exposure resulted in a significant (P < 0.05), dose-dependent decrease in plasma hemostatic function and concurrent significant (P < 0.05) decreases in activities of factor VII, factor VIII complex, and factor X. Fibrinogen concentration was not affected by SIN-1. Antithrombin and protein C activity also decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Coincubation with SOD or an OONO- scavenger significantly (P < 0.05) attenuated SIN-1 mediated changes in hemostasis and procoagulant/ anticoagulant activity. We conclude that OONO- may decrease hemostatic function in human plasma by nitration of key procoagulants and that OONO- may play a significant role in hemorrhagic states."

CD010438,0,23128358,0,In-vitro comparison of free oscillation rheometry (ReoRox) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in trauma patients upon hospital admission.,"Plasma-based assays do not provide accurate information on haemostatic resuscitation hence viscoelastic point-of-care haemostatic assays such as rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM Delta, Pentapharm) are used to monitor coagulopathy in trauma patients. Free oscillation rheometry (FOR) is a new whole blood haemostatic assay that measures not only the clot-forming process but also the initial viscous phase; this could potentially be of value when assessing traumatic coagulopathy. A comparative analysis between FOR and ROTEM was therefore performed. This is a prospective observational study of 40 adult trauma patients admitted to a level 1 trauma centre. Citrated whole blood was analysed with ROTEM EXTEM and FIBTEM assays and FOR Fibscreen1 and Fibscreen2 assays. Predefined variables of ROTEM and FOR were compared using Spearman's ρ. ROTEM maximum clot function (MCF) in both EXTEM and FIBTEM correlated (P < 0.0001 for both) with FOR maximum elasticity Fibscreen1 and Fibscreen2, respectively. Interestingly, ROTEM EXTEM clotting time did not correlate with any of the FOR clot initiation parameters COT1, COT2 or COT2-1 of Fibscreen1. A correlation between ROTEM EXTEM and FIBTEM and FOR Fibscreen1 and Fibscreen2 clot formation and clot strength was found as was a significant correlation between lysis index after 60 min and ClotSR30. ROTEM EXTEM did not correlate with COT1, COT2 or COT2-1 of Fibscreen1 and this warrants further investigation."

CD010438,0,15203716,0,The platelet function defect of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria.,"Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired stem cell disorder, characterised by an abnormal susceptibility of red blood cells to complement induced lysis, resulting in repeated episodes of intravascular haemolysis and haemoglobinuria, thromboembolic events at atypical locations and, to a much lesser extent, bleeding complications. Platelet function is assumed to be abnormal, however, a defect has not yet been characterised and underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To explore these issues, we investigated platelet function in PNH patients using assays for clot formation under low and high shear force (thrombelastography and PFA100 device), adhesion to glass beads in native whole blood (Hellem method), aggregometry using various agonists (Born method), and flow cytometric assays for baseline and agonist-induced surface expression density of alpha-granule (CD62P) and lysosomal granule proteins (CD63), ligand binding to surface receptors (thrombospondin), and expression density of activation-induced neoepitopes of the fibrinogen receptor complex (PAC-1). Platelet PNH clone size determined by CD55 and CD59 labelling was compared to the clone sizes of granulocytes, monocytes, erythrocytes, and reticulocytes. A profound reduction of platelet reactivity was observed in PNH patients for all ""global function"" assays (clot formation, adhesion, aggregation). Platelet hyporeactivity was confirmed using flow cytometric assays. Whereas baseline levels of flow cytometrically determined platelet activation markers did not differ significantly between controls and PNH patients, agonist-induced values of all markers were distinctly reduced in the PNH group. Moreover, significantly reduced white blood cell counts (3.1/nl vs. 5.9/nl), haemoglobin values (9.5 vs. 14.3/g per dl), and platelet counts (136 vs. 219/nl) delineate profound tricytopenia in PNH patients. The fraction of particular cell types lacking the surface expression of GPI-anchored glycoproteins is referred to as the respective PNH clone; median PNH clone sizes of cells with short life spans (reticulocytes, platelets, granulocytes) was 50-80% of total cell populations compared to 20% of red blood cells. The results of our laboratory investigations show, that in PNH, reduced platelet counts coincide with reduced platelet reactivity. The foremost clinical complication in PNH, however, is venous thromboembolism, very probably induced by an activated and dysregulated plasmatic coagulation system. From these seemingly contradictory findings we infer, that part of the platelet hyporeactivity is probably due to reactive downregulation of platelet function in response to chronic hyperstimulation. The overall result is thought to be an unsteady balance, associated with thromboembolism in a larger proportion of patients, and with bleeding in a smaller proportion."

A major drawback to the use of rFVIIa is its short half-life, necessitating frequent and intermittent bolus injections. Continuous infusion of rFVIIa has been reported as a feasible, convenient, safe and cost-effective alternative to intermittent bolus injections. We report the use of continuous rFVIIa infusion during and after left elbow arthroplasty in a hemophiliac with a high titer of inhibitor to factor VIII. rFVIIa was administered as a bolus injection (100 micrograms/kg) at the start of the operation, after which continuous infusion (10-30 micrograms/kg/h) was immediately started and continued for 6 days. Tranexamic acid (50 mg/kg/day, p.o.) was also administered as an antifibrinolytic treatment. Laboratory monitoring of hemostatic efficacy was performed in this case using prothrombin time and the thrombelastogram. Finally, effective intra- and postoperative hemostasis and normal healing of the surgical incisions were achieved, except for local thrombophlebitis. Although the optimal maintenance or target level of rFVIIa has been a matter of debate, we consider continuous infusion of rFVIIa to be a feasible, convenient, safe and cost-effective alternative to intermittent bolus injections."
CD010438,0,1720262,0,The use of high dose aprotinin in liver transplantation: the influence on fibrinolysis and blood loss.,"Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is frequently associated with systemic fibrinogenolysis and diffuse bleeding. At present antifibrinolytic treatment has not been initiated routinely in OLT. Therefore the influence of high dose aprotinin in OLT (2 million kallikrein inactivator units (KIU) given after induction of anesthesia followed by a 500,000 KIU/h infusion throughout the operation) on intraoperative blood loss and fibrinolysis was studied in 25 patients compared to 25 patients without aprotinin. The incidence of fibrinolysis shown in thrombelastography was 72% in the control group versus 16% in the aprotinin group. Oozing after reperfusion of the graft caused by severe fibrinolysis defined as a clot lysis index below 15% was only observed in the control group (42.8%). In contrast no significant difference was found between the groups in the course of fibrin and fibrinogen degradation product levels (FbDP, FgDP) although the mean concentrations of both parameters were evidently lower in the aprotinin treated patients. Levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity were initially high in both groups and peaked during and after the anhepatic period. After aprotinin there was a trend of lower t-PA levels which reached significance at the time of reperfusion (p less than 0.02). In both groups the course of thrombin antithrombin complex was in line with the variations of FbDP and FgDP. No correlation between thrombin formation and t-PA activity was found. Mean homologous blood requirement was reduced by 50% (5.6 +/- 4.0 vs. 11.2 +/- 8.6 units, p less than 0.005). The blood saving effect was more pronounced in the postanhepatic period (p less than 0.000001). In conclusion high dose aprotinin inhibits hyperfibrinolysis and reduces intraoperative homologous blood requirement. Therefore its routine use in OLT is recommended."
CD010438,0,23301969,0,Pathogenesis of acute traumatic coagulopathy.,"Acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC) is an early endogenous process, driven by the combination of tissue injury and shock that is associated with increased mortality and worse outcomes in the polytrauma patient. This review summarizes our current understanding of the pathophysiology of ATC and the role of rapid diagnostics in the management of severe trauma hemorrhage. In particular we consider diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for bleeding trauma patients with short versus long prehospital times and the concept of remote damage control resuscitation. Endothelial activation of Protein C is a central mechanism of ATC, which produces rapid anticoagulation and fibrinolysis following severe trauma. Continued blood loss, hypothermia, acidosis, and hemodilution potentiate ATC and lead to a global derangement in all components of hemostasis. The contribution and interplay between platelet activity, fibrinogen utilization, endothelial dysfunction, and neurohormonal pathways remain to be defined in ATC pathogenesis but may offer novel therapeutic targets. Conventional laboratory-based tests of coagulation have a limited role in the early management of major trauma hemorrhage. TEG and ROTEM provide a rapid evaluation of clot dynamics in whole blood and are of greater value than coagulation screens in diagnosing and managing trauma hemorrhage."

Plasma samples with platelet counts from 5 x 10(9)/l to 150 x 10(9)/l were spiked with rFVIIa (1 micro g/ml) or buffer. Clotting was initiated in the presence of diluted thromboplastin. Thrombin generation was assessed using the Thrombogram-Thrombinoscope trade mark assay. The kinetics of platelet activation was assessed using flow cytometry to measure the expression the P-selectin on platelet membrane of washed platelets suspended in defibrinated homologous PPP. Thromboelastography was used to evaluate the effect of platelets and rFVIIa on the kinetics of clot formation and clot's firmness. In the presence of low platelet counts the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and the maximum concentration of generated thrombin (Cmax) were reduced by 60%-70%. The lag-time of thrombin generation and the time required to reach the Cmax (Tmax) were prolonged, the velocity of platelet activation was decreased and thrombus formation was delayed. Recombinant FVIIa accelerated thrombin generation and platelet activation but it did not significantly modify ETP or Cmax. Recombinant FVIIa enhanced platelet activation in a TF and thrombin dependent manner since its effect on the studied parameters was abolished when TF was omitted or when hirudin was added into the experimental system respectively. Recombinant FVIIa normalized the velocity of clot formation but it did not modify clot firmness, which depended mainly on platelets' count. In conclusion, in experimental conditions simulating severe thrombocytopenia rFVIIa in the presence of low amounts of TF, accelerates thrombin generation, without increasing the maximum amount of generated thrombin, thus leading in enhanced platelet activation and rapid clot formation."

Interestingly, sparse data exist on the kinetics of platelet and coagulation activation in response to G-CSF and it is unknown if G-CSF augments shear-dependent platelet function. These two issues are addressed in the current trial. Thirty-six healthy volunteers were enrolled into this study. All subjects received a single-dose of 5 microg/kg filgrastim intravenously. The effects of recombinant G-CSF on platelet and coagulation function were assessed by the platelet function analyzer PFA-100 (collagen/epinephrine (CEPI-CT), collagen/ADP (CADP-CT) closure times), von Willebrand factor activity (vWF : RiCO) ELISA, tissue factor (TF)-mRNA expression on circulating leukocytes and rotation thrombelastography (ROTEM). G-CSF time-dependently enhanced shear dependent platelet function measured by the PFA-100: CEPI-CT declined by 48% and CADP-CT by 31% with nadir values after 24 h (p < 0.001 as compared to baseline) and returned to near-baseline values after 72 hours. In accordance, VWF : RiCO increased by 59% after 24 h (p < 0.001) and returned to baseline 48 h later. TF-mRNA peaked after 4 hours (>6 fold increase p < 0.001) and reached near-baseline values after 24 hours. Nadir closure times were seen after 24 hours (-15%; p < 0.001).

However, dilution of clotting factors and platelets together with impaired fibrinogen polymerization are associated with fluid therapy and may aggravate hemorrhage, thus worsening final outcome of these patients. We investigated, in an in vitro model, whether the addition of fibrinogen to diluted blood samples can reverse dilutional coagulopathy. Blood from 5 healthy male volunteers was diluted by 60% using lactated Ringer's solution, 4% modified gelatin solution, or 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4, as well as the combination of lactated Ringer's solution with either of the 2 colloid solutions. Thereafter, aliquots of diluted blood samples were incubated with 3 different concentrations of fibrinogen (0.75, 1.5, and 3.0 mg/mL). Measurements were performed by modified thrombelastography (ROTEM; Pentapharm, Munich, Germany). After 60% dilution, clotting times increased, whereas clot firmness and fibrin polymerization decreased significantly. After administration of fibrinogen, clotting times decreased and clot firmness, as well as fibrin polymerization, increased in all diluted blood samples. The effect of in vitro fibrinogen substitution on ROTEM variables was dependent on the fibrinogen dosage and the type of solution used to dilute the blood samples."

In the present study, the comparative effect of 6% HES 130/0.4 versus 6% HES 130/0.42 on blood coagulation was investigated in vitro. Thirty milliliter of blood was obtained from 10 healthy volunteers and was diluted by 10, 30 and 50% using either 6% HES 130/0.4 or HES 130/0.42, respectively. Blood coagulation was assessed using thrombelastography measurements (clotting time, clot formation time, maximal clot firmness and alpha-angle). The assessment of platelet function was performed with whole blood aggregometry after adding thrombin-receptor-activating protein. No differences were noted between respective dilutions of the two HES. Both colloids produced significant reductions below the reference values range in clotting time at 10, 30 and 50% dilutions. The 50% dilution of both colloids resulted in significant reduction of maximal clot firmness, alpha-angle and platelet aggregation.

A single transfusion protocol was used for all patients who underwent liver transplantation between 2007 and 2010. Thirty-eight patients received coagulation products when standard TEG cutoff values were exceeded, whereas another 39 patients received coagulation products when the TEG values were 35% greater than normal. The results of postoperative coagulation tests for total blood loss and the use of blood products were compared for the 2 groups. When the critical TEG values for transfusion were higher, significantly fewer units of fresh frozen plasma (5.58 ± 6.49 versus 11.53 ± 6.66 U) and pheresis platelets (1.84 ± 1.33 versus 3.55 ± 1.43 U) were used. There were no differences in blood loss or postoperative blood product use. In conclusion, the use of higher critical TEG values to initiate the transfusion of plasma-containing products is not associated with increased blood loss. Further testing is necessary to identify what TEG value predicts bleeding due to a deficit in coagulation factors."

The relative potency of the new heparin was found to be 1.45 to 1.77 with dog citrated blood and 1.77 to 2.41 with human citrated blood on the basis of different thrombelastographic parameters.
CD010438,0,11454258,0,Impact of plasmapheresis on platelet hemostatic capacity in healthy voluntary blood donors detected by the platelet function analyzer PFA-100.,"Previous flow cytometry studies showed that platelet activation may occur during cytapheresis, cardiopulmonary bypass and hemodialysis. The aim of this pilot study was to determine if the impact of plasmapheresis leads to alterations in platelet hemostatic capacity. Plasmapheresis was carried out in 30 volunteers using an Autopherese C (Baxter) and an MCS3p (Haemonetics). Blood samples were collected and analyzed immediately before and after plasmapheresis. As a result of the plasmapheresis on the Autopherese C, the mean closure time (CT) for collagen/epinephrine (Col/Epi) increased from 118.2 +/- 25.1 to 149.9 +/- 35.0 s and from 88.7 +/- 16.9 to 98.5 +/- 26.3 s for collagen/ADP (Col/ADP), respectively. Seven subjects showed impaired CTs after plasmapheresis for Col/Epi. For Col/ADP, five subjects showed impaired CTs after apheresis. Statistical analysis (McNemar test) showed a significant difference before and after apheresis for Col/Epi (P = 0.024) but not for Col/ADP (P = 0.088). Similar results were shown for plasmapheresis carried out with the MCS3p. These findings show that plasmapheresis can cause an impairment of platelet function in healthy volunteers as measured by the PFA-100, an effect of so far unknown clinical significance."

CD010438,0,22486761,0,Reference ranges for thromboelastography (TEG(®) ) and traditional coagulation tests in term parturients undergoing caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia*.,"There has been little published work defining 'normal' thromboelastography (TEG(®) ) values in healthy parturients, and few large studies defining reference ranges for traditional coagulation tests in this patient group. Our aim was to establish peri-operative reference ranges for TEG and for standard laboratory coagulation tests in our pregnant population. Fifty healthy term parturients presenting for elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia had blood samples taken pre-operatively, on arrival in the recovery room and, in a subset of 33 women, 4 h after routine thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin 40 mg. All three samples had TEG analysis, the first and second having standard laboratory coagulation tests in addition. Reference ranges for our pregnant population were established, demonstrating a hypercoagulable state in term parturients and a significant effect of enoxaparin. The standard coagulation reference ranges were within 98% of the local non-pregnant ranges. These reference ranges provide a useful comparator for peri-operative TEG and routine coagulation analysis in term parturients."
CD010438,0,12964741,0,Solid-phase reversible immobilization in microfluidic chips for the purification of dye-labeled DNA sequencing fragments.,"In this manuscript, we discuss the use of photoactivated polycarbonate (PC) for purification of dye-labeled terminator sequencing fragments using solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) prior to gel electrophoretic sorting of these DNAs. An immobilization bed for the DNA purification was produced by exposing a posted microchannel to UV radiation, which induced a surface photooxidation reaction, resulting in the production of carboxylate groups. The immobilization microchannel contained microposts to increase the loading level of DNAs to improve signal intensity without the need for preconcentration. By suspending the sequencing cocktail in an immobilization buffer (TEG/ethanol), the DNA fragments demonstrated a high affinity for this carboxylated surface. The loading density of DNAs to this activated surface was found to be 3.9 pmol cm(-2). The captured DNA could be subsequently released from the surface by incubation with ddH2O. SPRI cleanup of dye-terminator sequencing fragments using the photoactivated PC chip and slab gel electrophoresis produced a read length comparable to the conventional SPRI format, which utilized carboxylated magnetic beads and a magnetic field. The read length for the PC-SPRI format was found to be 620 bases with a calling accuracy of 98.9%. The PC-SPRI cleanup format was also integrated to a capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) system. The PC-SPRI method was shown to effectively remove excess dye terminator from the CGE tract, but yielded lower plate numbers, as compared to a direct injection method with purification accomplished off-chip. The loss in efficiency was found to result primarily from the extended injection time associated with the microchip purification method."
CD010438,0,15141797,0,Can we rely on arterial line sampling in performing activated plasma thromboplastin time after cardiac surgery?,"Arterial catheters are routinely used to sample blood for clotting studies in most cardiothoracic intensive care units. The clotting profile in surgical bleeding after cardiac surgery influences further management. Aspiration and discard of a certain amount of blood from the line, prior to sampling, are assumed to clear heparin contamination. We have investigated this assumption through analysis of the clotting profile by simultaneous arterial line and peripheral venous samples."
CD010438,0,3715155,0,Thromboelastographic assays of the clotting process in situations of obesity and caloric restriction.,"A study on blood clotting has been carried out in a number of obese individuals and compared to a group of non-obese persons, in order to assess if the former can be considered to be in ""high risk"" regarding the onset of a thromboembolic process. The technique of thromboelastography was chosen. The results point out that in obese people a series of alterations take place, both in the time of clot formation, which is enlarged, as in the organization of its nets, which appear strongly structured, favoured by the hyperfibrinogenemia and thrombocytosis detected in these subjects. Likewise, the effect of a hypocaloric diet on clotting in obese persons has been evaluated and compared with the former groups. Clotting in treated obese individuals is modified in the same way as in the untreated group when compared to the non-obese population; nevertheless, when both groups of obese people are compared, no significant difference is observed in the different parameters studied, even though constants determined in citrated whole blood are closer to normality in the subjects undergoing caloric restriction."

CD010438,0,8231315,0,Haemocompatibility optimisation of implants by hybrid structuring.,"State of the art in biomaterial research and implant design is a compromise between functionality and biocompatibility. Consequently, results often have disadvantages with respect to both aspects. With regard to biocompatibility, the activation of the clotting system by alloplastic materials is of great significance, because it necessitates anticoagulant therapy. Further improvements in implant technology require an understanding of the interactions between blood and implants. Therefore a microscopic model of thrombogenesis at alloplastic surfaces is briefly presented, relating thrombogenicity of a material to the electronic structure of its surface. The electronic requirements for high haemocompatibility, which result from this model (especially a low band-gap density of states and a high surface conductivity) are fulfilled by an amorphous alloy of silicon and carbon (a-SiC:H). The advantage of amorphous materials is that they do not obey stoichiometric rules. Thus they allow a continuous adjustment of the electronic parameters without fundamental changes in their mechanical and chemical properties. The theoretical results were checked in vitro by total internal reflection intrinsic fluorescence (TIRIF) spectroscopy as well as thrombelastography experiments (TEG). In comparison with conventional materials such as titanium or LTI carbon, the TEG-clotting time of a-SiC:H-coatings was prolonged by in excess of 200 per cent. As a consequence, a-SiC:H is well suited as a haemocompatible coating material for hybrid structuring of cardiovascular implants."

Fibrinogen concentration decreases by 34-42% of the preoperative level by the end of CPB. An inverse relationship between perioperative plasma fibrinogen levels and postoperative bleeding has been reported in CABG patients. Administration of fibrinogen concentrate after weaning from CPB in patients with diffuse microvascular bleeding may help promote haemostasis. We compared patient outcomes following fibrinogen concentrate administration or transfusion of allogeneics in CABG patients with decreased platelet function.
CD010438,0,505259,0,Monitoring of heparin therapy with thromboelastography.,The technique of thromboelastography was used to monitor the administration of heparin to patients with diagnosed deep vein thrombosis. The thromboelastograph uses a mechanical optical system to provide a continuous dynamic measure of the coagulation process. It has been found to be a highly sensitive device for the detection of response to heparin thus allowing a more precise administration of heparin frequently leading to a reduction in the dosage to maintain the coagulation process of the patient within therapeutic range. This allows a more individualized approach to the patient on anticoagulation therapy.

The aim of this review is to focus on point-of-care devices to monitor coagulation in trauma. Close monitoring of bleeding and coagulation as well as platelet function in trauma patients allows goal-directed transfusion and an optimization of the patient's coagulation, reduces the exposure to blood products, reduces costs, and probably improves clinical outcome. Noninvasive hemoglobin measurements are not to be used in trauma patients due to a lack in specificity and sensitivity."

CD010438,0,9140170,0,In vitro assessment of platelet function.,"With the realization that the skin bleeding time is often an unreliable measure of platelet function, efforts have been made to identify ways to assess qualitative platelet dysfunction. Currently available techniques measure platelet adhesion, platelet aggregation, the ability of platelets to retard or stop flow through fibers, and the contribution of platelets to in vitro clot formation. Glass bead adhesion, which continues to be performed in some laboratories, is gradually being replaced by measures of platelet adhesion to filters composed of glass fibers, Dacron fibers, or collagen. In each instance, anticoagulated platelet-rich plasma or whole blood flows through the filter under a regulated pressure gradient. The amount of blood flowing through the filter versus time and/or the time to filter occlusion are measured. Recent developments in platelet aggregation have focused on whole blood and stagnation point flow aggregation techniques. Whole blood aggregation does not require blood sample processing and accommodates blood obtained from citrated vacutainer tubes. Stagnation point flow measures both platelet adhesion and aggregation and may be able to detect pathologically-enhanced platelet function. Global measures of hemostasis attempt to simultaneously evaluate the adequacy of fluid phase coagulation and platelet function. Currently available techniques include Thromboelastography, SonoClot Analyzer, Hemodyne Hemostasis Analyzer, PITT, and Hemostatometry. Although each of these technologies have been shown to provide interesting data in the research setting, the ability of any of these techniques to detect abnormal or clinical inadequate platelet function remains to be established."

Recent investigations have demonstrated the potential for thromboelastography to assess the effects of bypassing agent therapy in this patient population. While tissue factor activation has been used in several prior studies, a recent multicentre study failed to demonstrate an expected concentration-response effect of rFVIIa and called into question the tissue factor activation methods that have been employed. A comparison of kaolin to two concentrations of tissue factor as the activation method for thromboelastography was investigated in patients with haemophilia. We performed kaolin and tissue factor activated thromboelastography on blood from inhibitor and non-inhibitor patients with and without addition of rFVIIa and rFVIII. The results demonstrate that kaolin leads to a longer R, K and angle than the higher dilution of tissue factor (1:17 000) at baseline (no factor) and after addition of rFVIIa for both the inhibitor and non-inhibitor patients. Kaolin led to a longer R and K in comparison to a low dilution of tissue factor (1:42 000) following the addition of rFVIIa in the inhibitor patients. The longer R and K allows for better discrimination of the effects of rFVIIa thus making kaolin the most sensitive activation method in this setting. Thus kaolin activated thromboelastography should be considered an effective, perhaps the most effective, activator when utilizing thromboelastography to assess the effects of rFVIIa in haemophilia patients with inhibitors."

CD010438,0,12812383,0,Value of thromboelastography in the assessment of platelet function.,"Thromboelastography (TEG) is a useful measure of coagulation. Modified TEG (that is with the addition of a GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist) has been used to assess the contribution of the fibrinogen-platelet interaction to TEG parameters (in particular the maximum amplitude, MA). Modified TEG was compared with other investigations of platelet function to assess its sensitivity in both normal subjects and in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a condition associated with activated platelets. Blood was collected from eight healthy subjects and 12 PAD patients. Platelet function was measured by TEG, flow cytometry (using PAC-1, P-selectin, GP IIIa and GP Ib murine antibodies) and platelet aggregometry (spontaneous and ADP-induced) in the presence and absence of tirofiban (a GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist). TEG showed a statistically significant reduction in MA with tirofiban at 0.4 mg/L and an increase in k (kinetic time; which indicates how fast clot strength is increasing once clotting starts) at 0.2 and 0.4 mg/L of tirofiban in both healthy subjects and PAD patients. Flow cytometry showed a significant decrease in the PAC-1 binding index (at 0.2 mg/L). This finding was compatible with the significant reductions found in spontaneous and ADP-induced platelet aggregation. However, aggregometry and flow cytometry were more sensitive indicators of platelet inhibition than the TEG parameters. TEG does not provide a comprehensive or sensitive reflection of impaired platelet function. If TEG is used as an index of severely impaired platelet function, we recommend that the k parameter should be used as well as MA. TEG should be supplemented by other methods of platelet function assessment wherever possible."

TEG was used to evaluate the effect of three infusion solutions (6% hydroxyexyethyl starch (HES) 200/0.5 - Hemohes; HES 130/0.4 - Voluven; modified gelatin solution - Gelofusin) on the hemostatic system in 36 bone marrow donors (healthy individuals). The solutions were used in combination with crystalloid solutions during a procedure to compensate for intraoperative blood loss. Hemostatic changes were noted by the end of an operation in all groups; however, these were less pronounced when Voluven was administered. Thus, all colloid infusion solutions have varying effects on the hemostatic system, with a tendency toward both hypo- and hypercoagulation. According to TEG, HES 130/0.4 (Voluven) has a minimal effect on the hemostatic system."

The patients were divided into 2 comparable groups: 1) a decision on fresh frozen donor plasma transfusion was taken only on the basis of laboratory parameters; 2) this was done on the basis of thromboelastographic data. In Group 2, the frequency of fresh frozen donor plasma transfusion proved to be 4 times less than that in Group 1.

CD010438,0,8364489,0,Sialic acid in fibrinogen: effects of sialic acid on fibrinogen-fibrin conversion by thrombin and properties of asialofibrin clot.,"The final stage in a series of blood coagulating reactions is fibrinogen-fibrin conversion by thrombin. This reaction consists of fibrinopeptide A and fibrinopeptide B release, polymerization of fibrin monomer, and stabilized fibrin formation by factor XIII. The latter two reactions require calcium. In the present study there was no difference in the rate of thrombin-induced fibrinopeptide release between fibrinogen and asialofibrinogen where sialic acid in the terminal end of carbohydrate moiety of fibrinogen was removed by neuraminidase, but turbidity associated with asialofibrin clot formation was increased more rapidly. In asialo-derivatives, the dissolution time of the clots in high concentrated urea solution tended to be shortened and rigidity as a gel tended to be decreased. In measurement by thromboelastography there was no difference in the reaction time (r) between fibrinogen and asialofibrinogen, but the maximum amplitude (ma) was obviously decreased in asialofibrinogen. Furthermore, when the rate of cross-link formation between gamma chains by F-XIII was compared, the production of gamma-dimer in the same reaction time was found to be lower and formation of stabilized fibrin tended to be retarded in asialofibrinogen. Sialic acid in fibrinogen thus may clearly influence the polymerization of fibrin-monomer and the formation of cross-linked fibrin in a series of reactions for fibrinogen-fibrin conversion. This may be consistent with the theory that fibrinogen sialic acid residues are low affinity calcium-binding sites and influence fibrin assembly."

CD010438,0,14979421,0,The effects of aprotinin on platelet function in blood exposed to eptifibatide: an in vitro analysis.,"The preoperative use of platelet inhibitors has increased the risk of bleeding during cardiac surgery. Aprotinin has been shown to preserve hemostatic function in patients undergoing CPB. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of aprotinin on coagulation in blood exposed to eptifibatide. Freshly collected bovine blood was used in an in vitro model of extracorporeal circulation. Blood was separated into two groups: activated (60 minutes exposure to bubble oxygenation) and nonactivated. Within each group there were four subgroups: control (n = 3), eptifibatide (2.8 microg/mL, n = 3), aprotinin (250 KIU/mL, n = 3), and eptifibatide with aprotinin (2.8 microg/mL, 250 KIU/mL, n = 3). Twenty-four modified extracorporeal circuits utilizing a hard-shell venous reservoir and cardioplegia heat exchangers were used. Blood flow was maintained at a rate of 1.25 L/min for a total of 170 minutes, at 37 +/- 1 degree C. Samples were collected at 0, 20, 50, and 110 minutes with the following variables measured: thromboelastograph (TEG), activated clotting time (ACT), and hematocrit (Hct). Results demonstrated that at 110 minutes, the TEG index (TI) was decreased by four-fold in the activated group compared to the nonactivated group (-4.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 1.4 +/- 1.5, p < .05). The administration of aprotinin resulted in preservation of the TI as compared to eptifibatide-treated blood (-4.9 +/- 1.2 vs. -7.9 +/- 1.2, p < .05). Aprotinin combined with eptifibatide reduced coagulation derangements when compared to eptifibatide alone (-5.2 +/- 1.2 vs. -7.9 +/- 1.2, p < .05). In conclusion, aprotinin attenuated the platelet inhibition effect of eptifibatide during in vitro CPB, resulting in improved coagulation."
CD010438,0,12358952,0,Coagulation effects of in vitro serial haemodilution with a balanced electrolyte hetastarch solution compared with a saline-based hetastarch solution and lactated Ringer's solution.,"The hydroxyethyl starches are a group of compounds that has been associated with impairment of coagulation when large volumes are administered. The thrombelastograph is commonly used to assess point-of-care whole blood coagulation. Little is known about the dose-response relationships of haemodilution, and it is reasonable to assume that a linear association exists. This may not be the case with altered electrolyte compositions of the fluids used for haemodilution. We have therefore conducted an in vitro study of haemodilution of human whole blood using lactated Ringer's solution and two high molecular weight hetastarches, one in a balanced salt solution, the other in a 0.9% saline solution. The thrombelastograph, commonly used for the assessment of the coagulation effects of synthetic colloids, was used as the coagulation assessment device. Serial haemodilution with hetastarch in a balanced salt solution demonstrated a biphasic response (of r-times and k-times, as well as alpha angles), with haemodilution in the 20-40% range causing enhanced coagulation, and higher degrees of dilution causing a decrease in overall coagulation performance. A similar picture was observed with lactated Ringer's solution, but only significantly so in alpha angles. Hetastarch in saline did not display this initial increased coagulability at mild to moderate dilutions. This biphasic response of lactated Ringer's solution and hetastarch in a balanced salt solution reflects the complex interaction of fluids and the coagulation system, and that these effects cannot be attributed to simple haemodilution. On the other hand, there was a linear decrease in maximum amplitude with haemodilution. Maximum amplitude was particularly affected by both starches, which is an expected finding in view of the known interaction between the hydroxyethyl starches and von Willebrand's factor."
CD010438,0,8501929,0,"Infusion of autologous platelet rich plasma does not reduce blood loss and product use after coronary artery bypass. A prospective, randomized, blinded study.","Prior nonblinded studies have suggested dramatic hemostatic effects and decreased plasma after cardiopulmonary bypass. Platelet rich plasma (8 to 10 ml/kg total body weight) was obtained (Haemonetics Plasma Saver; Haemonetics Corp., Natick, Mass.) from 51 patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass grafting before heparinization. After double-blinded randomization, the platelet rich plasma was reinfused immediately in the control group or after heparin reversal in the treatment group. Homologous blood product usage, blood loss, and the surgeon's intraoperative subjective assessment of coagulation were evaluated. Additionally, thromboelastography, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, activated clotting time, fibrinogen, platelet counts, and hematocrit values were evaluated before the operation, after heparin reversal, after infusion of platelet rich plasma or control solution, and 2 hours after infusion. The surgeon's subjective assessment of coagulation was not different between control and treatment groups (p = 0.78). According to specific predetermined transfusion guidelines, no statistically significant differences were found in the use of whole blood (p = 0.07), packed red blood cells (p = 0.62), platelets (p = 0.11), total units of blood products (p = 0.45), or in the percentage of patients receiving transfusions (control group 70%, treatment group 71%, p = 0.97). Cumulative amount of blood shed through the chest tube was not significantly different between the groups at any interval but tended toward significance at 4, 6, and 12 hours (p = 0.09, 0.07, and 0.09). The prothrombin time immediately after reinfusion of platelet rich plasma was significantly lower in the treatment group (p = 0.03), but all other laboratory studies were similar at each time interval. Infusion of platelet rich plasma after cardiopulmonary bypass in patients having uncomplicated primary coronary artery bypass grafting has minimal effects on the surgeon's assessment of coagulation, total transfusion requirements, mediastinal drainage, and laboratory studies of coagulation."

In our study, 1701 TEG's traces carried out in the last five years have been reviewed in order to evaluate the incidence of such patterns in both healthy subjects and in patients affected by different diseases. The data obtained show that such irregular post-maximal deflection's patterns are quite absence in healthy subjects while reaches a statistically significant incidence only in patients affected by diabetes mellitus, obesity or systemic hypertension. The results seem to suggest that the increased and irregular post-maximal TEG deflection is not a simply product of technique's mistake but may represent an useful index of some haemostatic alterations which need further studies."

CD010438,0,18544683,0,Polyphosphate enhances fibrin clot structure.,"Polyphosphate, a linear polymer of inorganic phosphate, is present in platelet dense granules and is secreted on platelet activation. We recently reported that polyphosphate is a potent hemostatic regulator, serving to activate the contact pathway of blood clotting and accelerate factor V activation. Because polyphosphate did not alter thrombin clotting times, it appeared to exert all its procoagulant actions upstream of thrombin. We now report that polyphosphate enhances fibrin clot structure in a calcium-dependent manner. Fibrin clots formed in the presence of polyphosphate had up to 3-fold higher turbidity, had higher mass-length ratios, and exhibited thicker fibers in scanning electron micrographs. The ability of polyphosphate to enhance fibrin clot turbidity was independent of factor XIIIa activity. When plasmin or a combination of plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activators were included in clotting reactions, fibrin clots formed in the presence of polyphosphate exhibited prolonged clot lysis times. Release of polyphosphate from activated platelets or infectious microorganisms may play an important role in modulating fibrin clot structure and increasing its resistance to fibrinolysis. Polyphosphate may also be useful in enhancing the structure of surgical fibrin sealants."

CD010438,0,7091514,0,Modification of the Haemonetics Cell Saver for optional high flow rate autotransfusion.,"Intraoperative autotransfusion is a technique well-suited to major vascular surgery. It is most effective when salvage and reinfusion of shed blood can be accomplished at flow rates compatible with the degree of hemorrhage encountered in both elective and emergency procedures. Appropriate equipment modifications can render commercially available autotransfusion devices safer and more effective in the management of intraoperative blood loss. The Cell Saver, a device which concentrates and washes salvaged red blood cells, is limited in its potential as an autotransfusion device because of its slow reinfusion rate. A modification was devised which expands the flow capabilities of the Cell Saver and allows rapid reinfusion of autologous whole blood. The modified blood circuit has been employed in 10 major vascular cases with favorable results, thus demonstrating its efficacy in the management of massive hemorrhage during vascular repair. Guidelines for the safe and effective use of the modified unit are stressed."

The technique would be justified in other procedures when intra-operative bleeding is significant and the quality of retrieved blood is satisfactory. We have studied the potential use of intra-operative autologous transfusion during caesarean section of 15 parturients. The quality of autologous blood (at different stages of the procedure) was assessed after being recovered and washed by ""Cell Saver 4"" (Haemonetics). Blood quality was assessed through 1) measuring the following: erythrocyte deformability with Erythrometer and Hemorheometer; blood and plasma viscosities; ATP, 2.3 DPG and plasma hemoglobin rates; and RBC morphology through SEM; 2) bacterial detection and identification; 3) detection of foetal cells which could create immunological disturbances if reinjected into the mother. The results showed: 1) little variation in RBC deformability properties with ATP and 2.3 DPG rates which, apart from a slight decrease, remained within the normal range; 2) a 20 fold increase in plasma hemoglobin persisting, despite successive washes, in 80% of cases; 3) positive Staphylococcus epidermidis hemoculture clinically irrelevant in the reinjectable bag in 90% of cases; 4) close to 1% foetal cells in the reinjectable bag in 20% of cases; 5) 8% abnormal cells as seen on SEM (Stage I echinocytes) and a slight swelling of the RBCs, which could account for their fragility.

Activated neutrophils release vasoactive and chemotactic factors which result in endothelial injury, lung parenchymal damage and the activation of platelets and coagulation pathways. To investigate the contribution of neutrophil activation to morbidity in young adults with cyanotic congenital heart disease, plasma neutrophil elastase levels were measured in 25 cyanotic patients and the results compared to patients with acyanotic heart disease and normal controls. Neutrophil elastase levels were significantly elevated in the group with cyanotic congenital heart disease (P < 0.001). Platelet activation was significantly increased in the patients with cyanotic heart disease (P < 0.001). Platelet aggregation was impaired only in those with haematocrits greater than 0.50 (P < 0.02). Whole blood coagulation, as determined by thrombelastography, was within normal limits.

CD010438,0,15735843,0,"Evidence based coagulation monitors: heparin monitoring, thromboelastography, and platelet function.","The hemostatic management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery is a unique challenge. Since its inception, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has required meticulous attention to maintaining adequate anticoagulation. New anticoagulants and alternative monitoring techniques present an opportunity to investigate potential advances in the area of anticoagulation for CPB. Hemostasis after CPB is still a vexing problem, and the addition of antiplatelet medication to the platelet defect already incurred during CPB has led to hemorrhagic complications in cardiac surgery. The two opposing processes of anticoagulation and hemostasis must be managed carefully and modified with respect to the patient's hematologic status and desired hemostatic outcome. Cardiac surgical patients consume a much larger fraction of perioperative blood transfusions than the percentage of the surgical population they represent. Thus, during CPB, careful attention must be paid to optimal anticoagulation, platelet quiescence, biocompatible circuitry and interventions, and to monitoring hemostasis. The multifactorial etiology of the CPB-induced hemostatic defect requires a multimodal approach to blood conservation and hemostasis monitoring, including heparin maintenance and sophisticated point-of-care hemostasis monitoring. Each technology has its own attributes and each may be suitable for different populations based upon the expected defects being measured. This article reviews the evidence supporting the use of point-of-care monitors in coagulation and hemostasis management in cardiac surgical patients."

CD010438,0,17653302,0,The involvement of Na+/K(+)-ATPase in the development of platelet procoagulant response.,"In circulation, platelets may come into contact with both exogenous (cardiac glycoside treatment) and endogenously produced inhibitors of Na+/K(+)-ATPase. We examined whether blocking of platelet Na+/K(+)-ATPase by ouabain results in generation of procoagulant activity. It was shown that an in vitro treatment of platelets with ouabain (20-200 microM for 20 to 60 min) is associated with an intracellular accumulation of sodium ([Na+](i)), generation of a weak calcium signal, and expression of procoagulant activity. The ouabain-induced procoagulant response was dose- and time-related, less pronounced than that evoked by collagen and similar to that produced by gramicidin, not affected by EDTA or aspirin, and strongly reduced in the absence of extracellular Na+ or by hyperosmolality. Flow cytometry studies revealed that ouabain treatment results in a unimodal left shift in the forward and side scatter of the entire platelet population indicating morphological changes of the plasma membrane. The shift was dose related, weaker than that evoked by collagen and similar to that produced by gramicidin. Ouabain-treated platelets express phosphatidylserine (PS). The ouabain-evoked PS expression was dose- and time-dependent, weaker than that produced by collagen and similar to that evoked by gramicidin. Electronic cell sizing measurements showed a dose-dependent increase in mean platelet volume upon treatment with ouabain. Hypoosmotically-evoked platelet swelling resulted in the appearance of procoagulant activity. Thromboelastography measurements indicate that, in whole blood, nanomolar (50-1000 nM, 15 min) concentrations of ouabain significantly accelerate the rate of clot formation initiated by contact and high extracellular concentration of calcium. We conclude that inefficiently operating platelet Na+/K(+)-ATPase results in a rise in [Na+](i). An increase in [Na+](i) and the swelling associated with it may produce PS exposure and a rise in membrane curvature leading to the generation of a procoagulant activity."

CD010438,0,15562037,0,The effect of dilution on plasma coagulation kinetics determined by thrombelastography is dependent on antithrombin activity and mode of activation.,"Hemodilution-associated hypercoagulability has been the focus of several investigations because significant morbidity and mortality have been associated with perioperative thrombophilia. Because most investigations implicate imbalances in procoagulant/anticoagulant activity as the etiology of hemodilution-associated hypercoagulability, we determined the effects of dilution on coagulation kinetics and clot strength with thrombelastography (TEG(R)). Control plasma (+/-celite activation) and antithrombin (AT)-deficient (<10% activity) plasma were diluted 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% with saline. TEG(R) variables measured included time to clot initiation (reaction time, R), speed of clot propagation (angle, alpha), and clot strength (amplitude, A; or shear elastic modulus, G). Dilution of control plasma (10%-30%) resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) 16% decrease in R values, no change in alpha values, and decrease in A and G values. AT-deficient plasma had significantly smaller R values compared with control, and dilution did not change R values in AT-deficient plasma. Celite activation eliminated dilution-associated changes in R values in control plasma but resulted in linear decreases (R(2) = 0.88-0.96, P < 0.0001) in alpha, A, and G in response to dilution. Thus, our data indirectly support the concept that decreases in AT activity cause dilution-mediated hypercoagulability in plasma. Finally, celite activation permits quantification of dilution with TEG."

Although the sensitivities of the bleeding time (71.4%) and platelet count (100%) were similar to the TEG (71.4%), the specificity (89.3%) of the TEG was greater than that of the bleeding time (78.5%) and platelet count (53.6%). Seven patients experienced clinically significant hemorrhage; 5 (71.4%) had an abnormal TEG. Three of 8 (38%) other patients with an abnormal TEG had no abnormal bleeding. Only 2 of 27 (7.4%) patients with a normal TEG had abnormal bleeding requiring platelet or FFP transfusion. Therefore, it is suggested that post-CPB patients with a normal TEG should not receive platelet or FFP transfusions empirically. If excessive bleeding is noted in a patient with a normal TEG, this suggests a surgically correctable etiology. Data from this series suggest that patients displaying an abnormal TEG appear to be at increased risk for hemorrhage; therefore, appropriate blood product support should be initiated at the first sign of accelerated bleeding."

Teltsch and co-authors report findings that suggest effective management controls involve providing buffer zones, irrigating in the daytime and in times of low humidity, reducing microorganism levels in water used for spraying, and testing for multiple types of viruses and bacteria (Teltsch & Katzenelson, 1978; Teltsch, Shuval, & Tadmor, 1980; Teltsch, Kedmi, Bonnet, Borenzstajn-Rotem, & Katzenelson, 1980). Camann, Moore, Harding, and Sorber support these findings. They also note that fecal streptococci are hardier than fecal coliform and appear frequently in background samples, suggesting that this bacterium is a better indicator of background and downwind conditions than are fecal coliform bacteria. In their study, storage prior to spray irrigation reduced microorganism concentrations by 99 percent. Downwind concentrations of sprayed reservoir water were often comparable to background values (Camann, Moore, Harding, & Sorber, 1988). Italian researchers (Brandi, Sisti, & Amagliani, 2000; Carducci, Gemelli, Cantiani, Casini, & Rovini, 1999; Carducci et al., 2000) confirm variable die-away rates of microorganisms, observe a positive association between fecal streptococci and the presence of viruses, and recommend consideration of submerged aeration for sludge digestion at sewage treatment plants. No reports are available that measure dispersion of bioaerosols from wastewater consistently treated to meet contemporary disinfection standards."

CD010438,0,19577246,0,Noncitrated whole blood is optimal for evaluation of postinjury coagulopathy with point-of-care rapid thrombelastography.,"Progressive postinjury coagulopathy has become the fundamental rationale for damage control surgery, and the decision to abort operative intervention must occur prior to overt laboratory confirmation of coagulopathy. Current coagulation testing is most commonly performed for monitoring anticoagulation therapy, the results are delayed, and the applicability of these tests in the trauma setting is questionable. Point-of-care (POC) rapid thrombelastography (r-TEG) provides real time analysis of thrombostatic function, which may allow for accurate, goal directed therapy. The test differs from standard thrombelastography (TEG) because the clotting process and subsequent analysis is accelerated by the addition of tissue factor to the whole blood sample, but is limited by the requirement that the analysis be performed within 4 min of blood draw to prevent clot formation. Consequently, citrated specimens have been proposed to obviate this time limitation. We hypothesized that the speed of r-TEG analysis following tissue factor addition to citrated blood might compromise accurate determinations compared with noncitrated whole blood. Additionally, we sought to compare the use of r-TEG with conventional coagulation tests in analysis of postinjury coagulopathy."

However, data are limited regarding the type and quantity of blood components necessary for TEG-guided blood component transfusion in coagulopathic critically ill patients with liver disease. We evaluated changes in four thrombelastogram variables (reaction time, thrombin constant time, alpha angle, and maximum amplitude) in whole blood samples after 74 separate blood component transfusions in 60 critically ill patients with a coagulopathy and liver disease. Only platelets significantly improved TEG variables in patients who received a single type of blood component. Each unit of platelets decreased the reaction and thrombin constant time by 0.43 (P < 0.05) and 0.82 (P < 0.005) min, respectively, increased the alpha angle by 1.5 degrees (P < 0.005), and the maximum amplitude by 1.4 mm (P < 0.005). In patients who received multiple blood components, cryoprecipitate decreased the thrombin constant time by 0.56 min/U (P < 0.05), and each unit of platelets decreased the thrombin constant time by 0.39 min (P < 0.005), and increased the alpha angle and maximum amplitude by 0.63 degrees (P < 0.05) and 0.99 mm (P < 0.005), respectively. We conclude that platelet transfusions, alone or in combination with other blood components, are most effective for improving abnormal TEG variables in coagulopathic critically ill patients with liver disease."

Upon photoexcitation, the iridium(III) complexes 1, 2, and 4 exhibited intense and long-lived orange-yellow luminescence in fluid solutions at 298 K and in rigid glass at 77 K. The rhodium(III) complexes 3 and 5 were weakly emissive in fluid solutions at 298 K but showed intense luminescence in low-temperature glass. In view of the structured emission profiles and the long lifetimes, the emission of all of the complexes has been assigned to a triplet intraligand ((3)IL) (pi --> pi*) (pba) excited state, which was probably mixed with some triplet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer ((3)MLCT) [dpi(Ir or Rh) --> pi*(pba)] character. To investigate the reactivity of the aldehyde groups, complex 2 was reacted with n-butylamine, resulting in the formation of the complex [Ir(ppy-CH(2)NHC(4)H(9))(2)(bpy-TEG-biotin)](PF(6)) (2a) [Hppy-CH(2)NHC(4)H(9) = 2-[4-[N-(n-butyl)aminomethyl]phenyl]pyridine]. All of the aldehyde complexes have been used to biotinylate bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form bioconjugates 1-BSA-5-BSA. The bioconjugates have been isolated, purified, and characterized and their photophysical properties studied. Upon photoexcitation, all of the bioconjugates were luminescent and the emission has been attributed to a (3)MLCT [dpi(Ir) --> pi*(N(wedge)N)] state for the iridium(III) conjugates and a mixed (3)IL (pi --> pi*) (N(wedge)N and N(wedge)C)/(3)MLCT [dpi(Rh) --> pi*(N(wedge)N)] state for the rhodium(III) conjugates. The avidin-binding properties of complexes 1, 2, 2a, and 3 and bioconjugates 1-BSA-3-BSA have been investigated using the 4'-hydroxyazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid assay. Emission titrations showed that complex 2a displayed a significant change of the emission profile upon binding to avidin. Additionally, the cytotoxicity of all of the iridium(III) and rhodium(III) complexes toward the human cervix epithelioid carcinoma cells has been examined by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Furthermore, the cellular uptake properties of the complexes and bioconjugate 2-BSA have been investigated by laser-scanning confocal microscopy."

CD010438,0,2093400,0,Orbitometer flow and thrombus formation.,"Orbitometry (Hartert) is a rheological ex-vivo method to follow up physical assembly of a coagulum in layers during natural intensity of flow by orbital movement. Fibrin elasticity in the Orbitometers mode of Resonance Thrombography is differentiated from platelet activity as well as e.g. from the effects of disseminated coagulation-minimal in liver disease and maximal during disturbances of delivery. Transition into the mode of dynamic Tendography (Hartert) will e.g. register all fast going tests lasting minutes or seconds. It is comparable to an accelerated form of Thrombelastography (Hartert), the intercourse of which with coagulum yet is an exclusively static operation. Another category is measurement of blood and plasma viscosity. In concentrated blood it seizes plasticity of blood cells as well as their intensity of aggregation in orbital flow. The latest methodical development of Orbitometry is control of platelet activity in its function of adhesion. This is realized by measurement of specific physical effects released in platelet containing coagulum. They generate a structural degradation of fibrin elasticity modul as well as a tendency for coagulum adhesion. The practical use of Adhesiography is control of anticoagulants and platelet protecting substances in their quantitative influence on coagulum structure and on the mentioned platelet activities. A special disturbance of these platelet depending mechnisms obviously is getting evidence in case of v. Willebrand's syndrome."
CD010438,0,2525934,0,Biomembranes as models for polymer surfaces. V.

We have examined the effect on blood coagulation of a number of substrates: those normally used in prosthetic devices such as polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, silicone and new polymers which contain the phosphatidylcholine head group (phosphorylcholine). The effect on coagulation of blood exposed to these substrates was determined by the technique of material thrombelastography, a relatively new method for the in vitro screening of biomaterial thrombogenicity. The results obtained with Dacron, polytetrafluoroethylene and silicone are compared with those obtained with a phospholipid-dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine, a polymerized phospholipid-diacetylenicphosphatidylcholine, and a range of recently synthesized polyesters, each of which contains the phosphorylcholine polar head group."

CD010438,0,18496260,0,Does Hextend impair coagulation compared to 6% hetastarch? An ex vivo thromboelastography study.,"The objective of this study was to determine if coagulation is different between 6% hetastarch in normal saline (NS) and 6% hetastarch in lactated Ringer's solution (LR), with use of an ex vivo thromboelastography (TEG) model with healthy donated volunteer blood. We simulated hemodilution that occurs during clinical resuscitation of hemorrhagic or hypovolemic shock, using healthy human donor whole blood (WB) ex vivo. Coagulopathy related to low, medium, high, or very high dilution of WB with NS or a high-molecular-weight hetastarch-based plasma expander, 6% hetastarch in NS (HSNS) or 6% hetastarch in lactated Ringer's [Hextend (HSLR)], was analyzed by thromboelastography (TEG). No changes were noted in the TEG profile of undiluted WB controls during the 6-hour period of use (P > 0.95). Dilution with HSNS and HSLR significantly impaired coagulation compared to both WB control and NS. Progressive dilution with NS impaired coagulation but to a lesser extent than colloids (P < 0.01). Low dilution of blood with NS increased clot strength by 12% (not significant; P = 0.097). We conclude that WB containing citrate obtained from healthy donors for TEG analysis yields reproducible data over a minimum of 6 hours. Either hetastarch, when present at concentrations comparable to the manufacturer's maximum recommended dose of 20 mL/kg (equivalent to the high dilution used in these experiments), decreases clot tensile strength to levels associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Substitution of lactated Ringer's for NS in 6% hetastarch appears to offer no advantage in avoiding hemostatic compromise in an in vitro model."

Studies have confirmed that enzymes in human saliva degrade composite resin monomers 2,2-bis [4-(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloxypropoxy) phenyl] propane (BisGMA) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) to release methacrylic acid (MA), bishydroxypropoxyphenyl propane (Bis-HPPP), and triethylene glycol (TEG) at levels of 50 microM in vivo. Studies have found that TEGDMA degradation products alter the growth and gene expression of cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. Specifically, TEG was shown to alter S. mutans gene expression levels of gtfB, a known virulence factor, and yfiV, a putative transcriptional regulator of cell-surface fatty acid genes. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of BisGMA degradation products on the growth and gene expression of S. mutans NG8 cells. Results demonstrated slight inhibition of bacterial growth at Bis-HPPP concentrations of 1.0 x 10(2) and 2.5 x 10(2) microM at pH 5.5. Furthermore, both MA and Bis-HPPP affected gtfB and yfiV expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Because BisGMA is universally used across most dental restorative materials, with millions of placement procedures performed annually, these findings are relevant due to the potential influence of resin monomer-derived biodegradation products on biofilm formation, acid tolerance, and proliferation of S. mutans cells."

These data were compared with those of a previous group of ALL patients who received L-asp as a single agent during consolidation (Group B). In Group A patients, mean plasma antithrombin activity decreased in the first 2 weeks, though not significantly. Relative to pretreatment values, mean fibrinogen concentration diminished particularly by week 3 (p less than 0.001). Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) decreased in the last week as well as after cessation of therapy with L-asp (p less than 0.05). Mean platelet count increased significantly by week 3 (p less than 0.05). Thromboelastograms performed in seven patients confirmed the tendency for thrombosis evidenced by a decreased APTT. Patients in Group B (L-asp alone during consolidation) had decreased concentrations of fibrinogen, AT, and Factors IX and X after L-asp therapy. APTT was prolonged. Our data demonstrate that the tendency for thrombosis is the predominant manifestation of L-asp induced coagulopathy, when the drug is associated with VCR and PDN. Thus the risk/benefit ratio for the use of L-asp early in induction in children with low risk ALL needs to be further evaluated."

CD010438,0,17900965,0,Rheometry and associated techniques for blood coagulation studies.,"This review considers various rheometrical approaches that have been adopted to study blood coagulation, with special reference to the rheological assessment of clotting time and studies of the evolution of viscoelasticity during the course of fibrin polymerization and cross-linking. The significance of the Gel Point in blood coagulation studies is discussed as a common feature of many of these studies in that they attempt to detect a liquid-to-solid transition during coagulation. Coagulation studies based on various forms of complex shear modulus measurements are considered, the latter being based principally on controlled stress and controlled strain rheometers. Also considered are the long established technique of thromboelastography and several emerging techniques such as wave propagation measurements, free oscillation rheometry, quartz crystal microbalance measurements and surface plasmon resonance."

Twenty patients were entered in the study; all had received chemotherapy and daily G-CSF (5 microg/kg subcutaneously) up to and including the first day of leucapheresis. The first leucapheresis was performed on the first day the peripheral blood absolute CD34+ cell count was > or =20 cells/microl. All patients underwent two leucaphereses on consecutive days. The patients were randomised to undergo either the first or second leucapheresis using the COBE Spectra Version 4.7 and then randomised to either the COBE Spectra Version 6 or Haemonetics MCS+ for the other leucapheresis. The target durations of the procedure on the COBE Spectra Version 4.7 and Version 6 were 180 minutes or 2 total blood volumes (TBV), and for the Haemonetics MCS+ was 20 cycles with four recirculations. All machines were operated on the 1997 software supplied by the respective manufacturers. The time taken for the procedure was significantly longer with both the Haemonetics MCS+ and the COBE Spectra Version 6 than the COBE Spectra Version 4.7. Both COBE Spectra versions processed significantly larger volumes of blood than the Haemonetics MCS+. The absolute yield of mononuclear cells, CFU-GM and CD34+ cells were all significantly lower with the Haemonetics MCS+ compared with both COBE Spectra versions, as were the yields per unit volume of blood processed. The product volume was significantly higher with the COBE Spectra Version 4.7 compared to the other two machines. There was no significant difference in the reduction in the platelet count following leucapheresis with any of the machines. The COBE Spectra Version 6 is particularly useful for patients with potentially poor peripheral venous access because of its increased interface stability."

However, not all studies reported benefit from anticoagulation for patients with severe sepsis, and time courses of coagulation abnormalities in septic shock are poorly documented. Therefore, the aim of this prospective observational cohort study was to describe the coagulation profile of patients with septic shock and to determine whether alterations of the profile are associated with hospital mortality."

CD010438,0,15870552,0,Multi-centre investigation on reference ranges for ROTEM thromboelastometry.,"Reagent-supported thromboelastometry (TEM) with the ROTEM Whole Blood Haemostasis Analyser is an enhancement of thromboelastography, a method that is increasingly used for the point of care monitoring of acute perioperative bleeding disorders. We investigated the reference ranges of two activated tests (INTEM and EXTEM) and a test analysing specifically the fibrin component of coagulation (FIBTEM) in a multi-centre approach. The reference ranges obtained for the clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), alpha angle (ALP), maximum clot firmness (MCF) and clot lysis parameters were comparable from centre to centre. INTEM: CT equals; 137-246 s, CFT equals; 40-100 s, MCF equals; 52-72 mm. EXTEM: CT equals; 42-74 s, CFT equals; 46-148 s, MCF equals; 49-71 mm. FIBTEM: MCF equals; 9-25 mm. ROTEM whole blood coagulation correlated weakly with a trend towards enhanced coagulation in females compared with males and in advanced age. The repeatability (within-run imprecision) of the results was dependent on the test with the following coefficients of variation: 1-5% (clot firmness, alpha angle), 3-12% (CT, CFT), 6-13% (FIBTEM clot firmness). Citrated blood samples were stable for ROTEM analysis stored within 6 h from drawing. In summary, the data showed that ROTEM thromboelastometry yields consistent values between centres and that providing general orientating reference ranges seems to be possible."

In the near future, one of our target is to decrease the transfusion risk. To reach this goal, it is very important to decrease the production of standard platelet concentrates from blood units by replacing them with platelet concentrates. For this work, we used MCS monitor from Haemonetics, equipped with two pumps. We have tested the platelet procedures by the mean of three programs (2.61, 3.61, 4.11 whole blood processed). The results showed good platelet yield (3.55, 4.82 and 5.37 1.10(11) for each program) with good quality of platelets up to 3 days storage (aggregation, beta-thromboglobulin release). The MCS machine could complete platelet apheresis systems and might in the future replace the classical standard platelet concentrates."

CD010438,0,19572069,0,Anticoagulant mechanisms of covalent antithrombin-heparin investigated by thrombelastography. Comparison with unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin.,"We have developed an antithrombin-heparin covalent complex (ATH) which inhibits coagulation enzymes by two mechanisms: directly, or by catalytic activation of plasma antithrombin (AT). Anticoagulation by ATH was compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) using a blood-based, tissue factor (TF)-activated thrombelastography (TEG) assay. Simplified TEG assays with plasma or purified plasma components were used to determine the contribution of the direct and catalytic mechanisms to ATH efficacy. Low anti-Xa concentrations of UFH inhibited clot formation significantly more than equivalent concentrations of ATH or LMWH in blood and plasma. ATH had reduced ability to catalyse AT-mediated thrombin (IIa) inhibition compared to UFH. However, at high anti-Xa concentrations, ATH had similar anticoagulant activity to UFH. ATH and non-covalent AT+UFH directly inhibited clotting to a similar degree in AT-deficient plasma. IIa-ATH complexes, which are limited to catalytic inhibition, displayed impaired anticoagulation compared to free ATH, and the magnitude of this effect increased significantly as anticoagulant concentration increased. Kinetic experiments indicated that the rate of reaction of AT with IIa is lower when catalysed by ATH versus UFH. In conclusion, at low anti-Xa doses catalytic inhibition is the primary mechanism of ATH anticoagulation, and the catalytic potential of ATH is reduced relative to UFH. However, the direct inhibitory activity of ATH is comparable to non-covalent AT+UFH, and at high anti-Xa doses the direct inhibitory activity of ATH may play a larger role in anticoagulation."
CD010438,0,16777761,0,Whole blood thrombelastographic coagulation profiles using minimal tissue factor activation can display hypercoagulation in thrombosis-prone patients.,"Recently, our laboratory devised a dynamic whole blood (WB) thrombelastographic coagulation model employing activation with minute amounts of tissue factor. A series of studies were conducted to validate the feasibility of the model to illustrate hypocoagulation in various bleeding disorders and its usefulness in detecting the haemostatic effect of pro-coagulants by ex vivo titration experiments. In this context, the present study hypothesized that the thrombelastographic model also can reveal hypercoagulation. Hence, the objective of the present study was to record dynamic WB coagulation profiles in a series of patients (n=76) who had previously suffered from a venous (n=34) or arterial (n=42) thrombo-embolic event and to compare the results with those of a group of healthy reference subjects (n=60)."

Use of acute normovolemic hemodilution in coronary heart disease].,"Normovolemic hemodilution (15 mg/kg body-weight: group I) was undertaken in 100 patients immediately before the start of coronary-artery surgery. In addition, a Cell-Saver (Haemonetics, Munich) was used for intra-operative autotransfusion. Another group of 100 patients (group II) was similarly operated on without autotransfusion (the study was conducted on 200 consecutive patients undergoing aorto-coronary bypass). Before blood (autologous or homologous) was administered a reduction of hemoglobin to 9 g/100 ml and hematocrit to 0.28 was well tolerated (during extracorporeal circulation: 6.5 g/100 ml and 0.16, respectively). Due to intra- and postoperative complications, such as infarct bleeding (including reoperation) or septicemia, the number of patients placed in group I fell to 94, that in group II to 90. Acute normovolemic hemodilution increased cardiac output and oxygen transport capacity, while other hemodynamic parameters remained unchanged, and there was no effect on extravascular lung water. Autotransfusion reduced the need for homologous blood derivatives by 71% (fresh blood, fresh plasma, RBC concentrates). No clinically significant disadvantages occurred."

CD010438,0,16788320,0,Resistance of porcine blood clots to lysis relates to poor activation of porcine plasminogen by tissue plasminogen activator.,"In-vitro experimentation was performed on porcine and human blood to determine their comparative responsiveness to a novel fibrinolytic inhibitor and thereby assess whether the pig is a suitable animal model for subsequent in-vivo testing of this inhibitor. Thromboelastography showed the clots formed from porcine whole blood to be highly resistant to tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)-catalyzed lysis, and this communication offers the resistance of porcine plasminogen to activation by t-PA as an explanation. Porcine blood containing 100 and 1500 IU/ml added t-PA lysed very slowly, having LY30 values of 1.9 +/- 1.4 and 2.9 +/- 1.9%, respectively. In contrast, the LY30 values for the human clots containing 100 and 1500 IU/ml t-PA were 77.1 +/- 6.3 and 93.3 +/- 1.3%, respectively. Moreover, purified porcine plasminogen was activated very slowly by added t-PA in the presence of both human and porcine fibrin. Activation of plasminogen by the endogenous activators, as measured by the euglobulin clot lysis time, was greatly prolonged for the pig (22 +/- 3 h) compared with the human (3.5 +/- 1.5 h). These results suggest caution in using the pig as an experimental model when studying the effects of various agents on fibrinolysis."
CD010438,0,17331267,0,Antithrombin and hypercoagulability in sepsis: insights from thrombelastography?,"Antithrombin (AT) has been used for over 25 years to successfully treat disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A four-day AT therapy in patients with DIC in the KyberSept trial has been related to a clear survival benefit in patients not receiving concomitant heparin. Gonano and coworkers performed thrombelastography (TEG) measurements in patients with severe sepsis and clearly showed hypercoagulability, as defined by five TEG parameters, compared to healthy controls. In the AT group they found a trend towards normalization of TEG parameters after treatment, although this did not reach statistical significance. This first clinical evaluation of hypercoagulability during AT treatment could not provide evidence for an attenuation of coagulopathy, an effect that might be due to high inter-individual variability."

Immunochemotherapy with tegafur suppository (Teg sp) 1,000 mg/day and OK432 i.m. was performed for one month after TAE. Instead of OK432, lentinan (LNT) 2 mg in 20% glucose sol. 20 ml i.v./wk was combined with Teg sp 1,000 mg/day from May 13, 1987. Teg sp was reduced to 1,000 mg/2 days from June of the same year, and since then the same therapy of Teg + LNT has been continuing even now. Serum AFP values showing 150 X 10(4) ng/ml at maximum were decreased down to less than 20 ng/ml 13 months after this therapy (total doses: Teg ca. 250 g, LNT 108 mg), remaining still normal. Marked reduction in the size of the lesion (PR) by the therapy has also been proved by the body CT. His PS is now in grade 0. Although in this case the initial steep decline in AFP values was possibly brought about by TAE, the successive antitumor effect indicated by persistent low AFP values may have been mainly due to Teg + LNT. Collection of data on the therapy is needed to clarify this point."

CD010438,0,23301972,1,Prehospital detection of traumatic coagulopathy.,"Increased focus on traumatic coagulopathy over the last decade has led to more aggressive use of hemostatic agents in resuscitation of the massively bleeding patient. Novel formulations of plasma factors and other therapeutics have opened for early intervention to prevent coagulopathy and may even be utilized in the prehospital setting. Careful selection of patients to receive hemostatic agents early during the resuscitation is of great importance due to the potential detrimental effects of this treatment. Several studies have identified coagulation parameters as reliable predictors of massive transfusion, even very early after trauma. Prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT/INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen concentration, and viscoelastic tests such as thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (RoTEM) have proved to be of value in predicting massive transfusion when performed in-hospital. PT/INR appears to be slightly more accurate than the other parameters, with a reported sensitivity of 84.8% and an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.87. Comparison studies on PT/INR, aPTT, and viscoelastic assays do suggest that caution should be taken when point-of-care (POC) methods, as opposed to conventional laboratory analyses, are used. Novel techniques for POC measurement of fibrinogen levels are currently being developed, and preclinical data suggest acceptable agreement with conventional methods. A number of factors should be considered regarding the feasibility of POC tests in the prehospital environment. In addition to environmental factors such as temperature, altitude, and humidity, electromagnetic interference issues and operators' skills must be taken into account. Coagulation parameters appear to be a useful tool in identifying patients with increased risk of massive bleeding at an early stage. Further studies are needed to determine if prehospital intervention based on POC analyses improves outcome."
CD010438,0,8400097,0,An assessment of the duration of cephapirin-induced coagulation abnormalities as measured by thromboelastography.,"Cephalosporin antibiotics are used prophylactically in cardiothoracic surgery to prevent postoperative infection. In 30 patients undergoing primary elective coronary artery bypass grafting, the whole blood coagulation system was prospectively evaluated before, and 10 and 30 minutes after administration of 1 g of cephapirin (Cefadyl, Bristol Laboratory, Evansville, IN). All patients had normal preoperative coagulation studies and had not received anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy within 7 days of surgery. At 10 minutes after cephapirin administration, 23 of 30 patients had a significant change in all phases of whole blood coagulation as monitored by thromboelastography (TEG). Thirty minutes after cephapirin administration there was no statistical difference compared with the baseline TEG. It is concluded that cephapirin can cause a significant but transient change in the viscoelastic properties of blood. Coagulation parameters of the TEG should be measured prior to cephapirin administration to prevent errors in establishing baseline values prior to cardiopulmonary bypass."

The patients were divided into 2 groups: streptodecase and heparin were administered to the patients of the 1st group and heparin only was administered to the patients of the 2nd group. No significant effect of streptodecase on the hemocoagulation link of hemostasis with a low risk of developing hemorrhagic complications was noted. In 72-96 h of treatment intravenous heparin administration resulted in a decrease in a level of blood antithrombin III causing a decrease in the efficacy of heparin therapy. Control over a level of blood antithrombin III in addition to routine tests (thrombin time, thromboelastogram) provided an opportunity for adequate anticoagulant therapy. A negative effect of heparin on the thrombocytic link of hemostasis with deterioration of disaggregation properties and an increase in aggregation was noted. Antiaggregation therapy in parallel with the start of heparin administration was found necessary."

The composites were, by weight, 75% or 79% glass filler and 25% or 21% resin composed of 60% Bis-GMA and 40% TEG-DMA. The filler was either strontium glass (75Sr or 79Sr) or a combination, by weight, of 90% strontium glass and 10% colloidal silica (75Sr10 or 79Sr10). The specimens, 2 x 4 x 70 mm bars, were aged in either air or distilled water at 37 degrees C and were tested in their respective aging media at a loading rate of 1.22 mm/s. The sigma f and E were tested in four-point loading and the KIC in three-point loading. The addition of the fillers to the unfilled resin resulted in a statistically significant increase in the flexure strength, flexure modulus, and fracture toughness. Aging in air had minimal effect on these properties. However, testing and aging in water led to a significant decrease in the mechanical properties in the first 6 months, but had limited effect from 6 to 12 months."

CD010438,0,23041210,0,Monitoring of unfractionated heparin with rotational thrombelastometry using the prothrombinase-induced clotting time reagent (PiCT®).,"To achieve sufficient and safe anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) a close and reliable drug monitoring is necessary. In general, the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is used for this purpose. In acute phase response, however, the APTT test procedure might be unreliable e.g. with false low results in the presence of elevated factor VIII. In this so called heparin resistance, measurement of anti-Xa activity is recommended over APTT to avoid potentially harmful dose escalation. A combination of anti-Xa measurement and global hemostatic testing with ROTEM® employing the anti-Xa sensitive PiCT® reagent showed high correlation with enoxaparin levels. This test modification could also be suitable for monitoring UFH. Aim of the study was to evaluate the correlation between PiCT®-ROTEM® and levels of UFH."

Twenty patients scheduled for coronary bypass grafting were assessed (off-pump group A, n = 10; on-pump group B, n = 10). Blood samples for roTEG examination were taken preoperatively (t0), 15 minutes after sternotomy (t1), on the completion of peripheral bypass anastomoses (t2), and at the end of procedures (t3). The time points for D-dimer levels analyses were before operation, at the end of procedures, and 24 hours later. A certain degree of roTEG signs of fibrinolysis was noticed at time t2 in both groups and in group B these marks were quite widely, but not significantly expressed (P for intergroup differences for Lysis on Set Time at 60 and 150 minutes were P = 0.190 and P = 0.122, respectively), borderline differences were found for Maximum Clot Firmness (P = 0.082) with a lower mean value for group B (arithmetic means [95% confidence intervals]--57.7 [54.2; 61.2] mm). Completely expressed roTEG signs of hyperfibrinolysis were observed in 2 patients from group B. In group B also the highest geometric means of D-dimers (1326.0 [943.5; 1863.6] ng mL(-1)) and thus a dramatic intergroup difference (P < 0.001) were observed at the end of surgery; 24 hours later the significantly elevated D-dimer levels in both groups (A: 1070.0 [723.5; 1582.6] versus B: 1093.3 [732.0; 1632.9] ng mL(-1)) were equalized (P = 0.932).

We have tested a Haemonetics semicontinuous blood cell separator in order to process large volumes of bone marrow with minimal bone marrow manipulation. The efficacy of isopycnic density floatation was tested in a one and a two-step procedure. Both procedures showed a recovery of about 20% of the nucleated cells and 1-2% of the erythrocytes. The enrichment of clonogenic cells in the one-step procedure appeared superior to the two-step enrichment, first separating buffy coat cells. The recovery of clonogenic cells was 70 and 50%, respectively. Repopulation capacity of the low-density cell fraction containing the clonogenic cells was excellent after autologous reinfusion (6 cases) and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (3 cases). Fast enrichment of large volumes of bone marrow aspirates with low-density cells containing the clonogenic cells by isopycnic density floatation centrifugation can be done safely using a Haemonetics blood cell separator."

The Platelet Mapping Assay has been described as a platelet aggregation assay for thromboelastography TEG. The aim of this experimental trial was to evaluate feasibility of the Platelet Mapping Assay on the ROTEM test system. Whole blood was drawn from 22 adult volunteers and patients with and without antiplatelet medication. Platelet aggregability was determined in three whole blood assays: the Platelet Mapping Assay using both activators arachidonic acid (AA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) on TEG, its adapted version on ROTEM, and the multiple electrode impedance aggregometer Multiplate. Percent aggregation inhibition results were plotted in a linear regression analysis and correlation was estimated. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting antiplatelet medication were determined. Overall correlations were statistically significant with an r(2) = 0.83 in AA-activated and an r(2) = 0.82 in ADP-activated Platelet Mapping Assay. AA-activated tests and the Multiplate analysis identified aspirin-inhibition in 86% and 100%, respectively. ADP-activated tests and the Multiplate analysis identified clopidogrel-inhibition in 67% and 89%, respectively. Specificity was low both in ROTEM and TEG. Differences in frequency distribution between the results obtained in ROTEM and TEG were not statistically significant. The Platelet Mapping Assay can be performed on the ROTEM. For the perioperative scenario, however, longer test duration and higher costs have to be considered compared to Multiplate analyses."

However, a study examining their relation has not been reported. We analysed the relation between measurements of thrombogenicity and biomarkers in patients undergoing stenting and followed for 24 months recurrent ischemic events. In 84 consecutive patients undergoing stenting, pre-procedure thrombogenicity was measured by thrombelastography (TEG) and conventional aggregometry whereas biomarkers were measured by fluorokine multi-analyte profiling. Patients were stratified into quartiles based on platelet-fibrin clot strength (MA) by TEG and correlated with ischemic event occurrence. Patients in the highest MA quartile (high MA) had greater ADP-induced platelet aggregation (57.5 +/- 15.0% vs. 47.9 +/- 17.6%, p = 0.05), C-reactive protein (25.0 +/- 5.6 vs. 4.2 +/- 1.0 microg/mL, p = 0.006) and interleukin-8 (23.8 +/- 2.8 vs. 14.1 +/- 1.6 pg/mL, p < 0.001) than patients within the lowest MA quartile (low MA). Epidermal growth factor (7.7 +/- 2.2 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.3 pg/mL, p = 0.006) and vascular endothelial growth factor (296 +/- 35 vs. 190 +/- 10 pg/mL, p = 0.05) were also higher. Patients with high-MA had an ischemic event more often than patients with low-MA (48% vs. 13%, p = 0.02). Our study suggests that a link is present between inflammation and heightened thrombogenicity measured pre-procedurally in the patient at high risk for recurrent ischemic events after stenting. Larger studies are required to solidify these observations and their clinical relevance."
CD010438,0,1723874,0,The intra-operative use of trasylol (aprotinin) in liver transplantation.,"Aprotinin has been reported to reduce blood loss in difficult cases requiring cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and more recently in liver transplantation. Over a 9-month period we compared the effects of an intra-operative infusion of aprotinin on transfusion requirements and coagulation profiles in 12 patients undergoing liver transplantation for end-stage cirrhosis with an equal number of consecutive transplants in patients with similar pathology who did not receive aprotinin. Transfusion of blood and blood products was reduced to one-third in the aprotinin-treated group. Operative time was also significantly reduced, as was ICU stay post-operatively. Aprotinin profoundly inhibits fibrinolysis and this is likely to be the major effect by which blood loss is reduced. Thromboelastography revealed severe fibrinolytic changes in the anhepatic stage in 4 of 6 controlled patients; this accelerated in 3 following reperfusion of the new graft. By contrast, only 1 patient of 12 in the aprotinin-treated group showed fibrinolytic activity in the anhepatic period, and none showed evidence of fibrinolysis following reperfusion of the new graft."
CD010438,0,6887843,0,The transfer test: a new screening procedure for thrombotic diseases.,"The transfer test (TT) measures by means of thromboelastography the capacity of a plasma to shorten the coagulation time of a control plasma. The value of the TT was compared to that of fibrin(ogen), degradation products (FDP), and ethanol gelatin test (EGT) in various diseases (group I), in confirmed deep venous thrombosis (group II), and in confirmed pulmonary embolism (group III). In 211 consecutive patients admitted for various diseases the results of the TT, FDP, and EGT were abnormal in 12.3, 11.3, and 66.6%, respectively, of the cases. In 59 consecutive patients with deep venous thrombosis confirmed by radiological phlebography the results of TT, FDP, and EGT were abnormal at admission time in 96.6, 89.8, and 44%, respectively, of the cases. In 45 consecutive patients with pulmonary embolism confirmed by lung scintigraphy the results of TT, FDP, and EGT were abnormal at admission time in 97.7, 97.6, and 88%, respectively, of the cases. Among the three parameters which were evaluated, the TT seems to be the most sensitive screening procedure for thrombotic diseases. A normal result of TT is a strong argument against a recent thrombotic venous phenomenon."

Congenital and acquired hypercoagulable states may play an important role in the pathogenesis of nCDVT. In this study, we evaluated fibrinolytic parameters by measuring individual concentrations of fibrinolytic proteins and by tissue factor initiated whole blood thromboelastography (TEG), in which a fibrin clot was lyzed by exogenously added tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Children with nCDVT were compared with age and sex-matched controls. TAFI concentrations were significantly higher in the patient group but there was no difference in the PAI-1, tPA and lipoprotein (a) concentrations. Significantly decreased fibrinolysis was found on TEG in the patient group suggesting that hypofibrinolysis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of nCDVT in children. To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric study that has systematically evaluated the role of fibrinolysis in the pathogenesis of DVT. Given our results, the role of fibrinolysis in the pathogenesis of nCDVT in children should be further evaluated in larger studies."

After first-line therapy, all patients received mobilising chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 4 g/m(2)) and daily G-CSF. The first leucapheresis was performed on the first day the peripheral blood absolute CD34(+) cell count was > 20 cells/microl. All patients underwent 2 leucaphereses on consecutive days. The patients were randomised to undergo either the first or second leucapheresis using the COBE Spectra. The target duration of the procedure on the COBE Spectra was 2 total blood volumes, and for the Haemonetics MCS(+) it was 20 cycles with four recirculations. Between September 2003 and March 2005, 60 patients were entered in the study. COBE Spectra version 6 processed significantly larger volumes of blood than the Haemonetics MCS(+) (8,845 and 5,680 ml, respectively, P < 0.01). The absolute yield of mononuclear cells (2.1 vs. 1.5 x 10(8)/kg, P = 0.04), CFU-GM (11 vs. 3 x 10(4)/kg, P = 0.01) and CD34(+) cells (3 vs. 1.7 x 10(6)/kg, P = 0.02) were all significantly higher with the COBE Spectra version 6, as were the yields per unit volume of blood processed. In conclusion, our study shows that COBE Spectra Version 6 is faster and has a better yield than the Haemonetics MCS(+), in patients with multiple myeloma."

The patient was anticoagulated using unfractionated heparin, acetylsalicylic acid and dipyridamole. Contact and tissue factor-activated thromboelastometry revealed increased clot firmness, although anticoagulation assessed by APTT was in accordance with the treatment protocol. Strength of polymerized fibrin was also increased. We saw no clinical signs of thrombosis. Thromboelastometry normalized after heart transplantation. Our results suggest that hypercoagulability is due to excess fibrin formation. Monitoring anticoagulation using APTT may, therefore, be misleading during mechanical cardiac assist."

CD010438,0,10551401,0,Correction of both prothrombin time and primary haemostasis by recombinant factor VII during therapeutic alcohol injection of hepatocellular cancer in liver cirrhosis.,"We evaluated the efficacy of recombinant factor VII to correct impaired haemostasis in a patient with liver cirrhosis requiring an invasive procedure. A test intravenous bolus of 80 microg/kg of recombinant factor VII was given to a Jehovah's Witness, with a solitary 4.4-cm hepatocellular carcinoma and underlying hepatitis C virus cirrhosis, in an attempt to correct his haemostatic disorders and safely inject the tumour with alcohol. An extensive portal block had precluded consideration of liver transplantation. Haemostasis was evaluated by clotting assays, bleeding time and thromboelastography 10 min before and 10 min and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h after factor VII infusion. Parameters of both coagulation (prothrombin time) and platelet function (bleeding time and the alpha and ma parameters of thrombelastography) were improved 10 min after factor VII infusion; improvements lasted 4 to 8 h or more. Platelet count did not change and there was no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. The improvements in haemostatic parameters correlated significantly with the increases in factor VII plasma concentrations (p<0.04). Factor VII clearance was 25.1 U/h/kg and its half-life was 5.8 h. The same dose of recombinant factor VII was given to the patient 1 week later, just before the alcohol injections. The patient had no subsequent bleeding or other complication, with no change in haemoglobin levels over 24 h. Thus, recombinant factor VII represents a therapeutic advance, as it can correct fully both coagulation and platelet function defects in cirrhosis and allow invasive procedures to be performed safely."

A combined technique of hemodilution and intraoperative blood salvaging was applied to supplement the blood loss during the operation. Intraoperative monitoring included continuous arterial pressure, heart rate, electrocardiograph, SVO2, bleeding time, prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (APTT), and thromboelastography. A total of 900 ml of blood was drawn and the same volume of 5% albumin solution was infused over half an hour before the beginning of the surgery. During the operation, 2100 ml of blood was lost, and 1260 ml of autologous blood, 400 ml of homogeneous red blood cells and 5 units of fresh platelet were infused. The values of PT, APTT, bleeding time were within normal ranges after the surgery. Only 3 units of fresh platelet was infused in 2 weeks after the surgery. It was suggested that hemodilution and salvaging autotransfusion is safely performed and beneficial to minimize homogeneous blood transfusion even in a case of aplastic anemia."

Rapid thrombelastography (RapidTEG) is a new variant of thrombelastography (TEG), in which coagulation is initiated by the addition of protein tissue factor. The kinetics of coagulation and the times of measurement were compared for two variants of TEG--RapidTEG and conventional TEG, in which coagulation was initiated with kaolin. The measurements were performed on blood samples from 20 patients with multiple injuries. The RapidTEG results were also compared with conventional measurements of blood coagulation. The mean time for the RapidTEG test was 19.2 +/- 3.1 minutes (mean +/- SD), in comparison with 29.9 +/- 4.3 minutes for kaolin TEG and 34.1 +/- 14.5 minutes for conventional coagulation tests. The mean time for the RapidTEG test was 30.8 +/- 5.72 minutes, in comparison with 41.5 +/- 5.66 minutes for kaolin TEG and 64.9 +/- 18.8 for conventional coagulation tests---measured from admission of the patients to the resuscitation bay until the results were available. There were significant correlations between the RapidTEG results and those from kaolin TEG and conventional coagulation tests. RapidTEG is the most rapid available test for providing reliable information on coagulopathy in patients with multiple injuries. This has implications for improving patient care."

Thrombelastograph k values increased (7.1 vs 5.4 min baseline, P < or = .01), and alpha angle (43 vs 52 degrees baseline, P < or = .001) and ma (39 vs 52 mm baseline, P < or = .01) values decreased following graft placement, while r values remained unaffected (6.4 vs 7.5 min baseline, P > .05). Weak correlations were observed between alpha angle and fibrinogen, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), as well as between k and aPTT (0.70 < r < 0.79 for all). Systemic fibrinolysis was suggested by thrombelastography in 25% of samples, although euglobulin lysis times were abnormal in only 5% (chi 2 = 4.80, P < or = .05). Fibrin degradation product detection increased through the fifth postoperative day in all patients. Variations in thrombelastographic parameters and their correlation to standard coagulation tests in patients undergoing uncomplicated abdominal aortic aneurysm repair were documented. In such a setting, no clear advantages to thrombelastography were defined. Further observations will be necessary to establish the role for thrombelastography in the management of patients experiencing clinically significant perioperative coagulation disorders."

Studies have confirmed that saliva can catalyze the degradation of constitutive monomers in dental restorative composites, forming biodegradation by-products (BBPs) such as methacrylic acid (MA), and triethylene glycol (TEG). TEG accelerates the growth of Streptococcus mutans, a major etiological agent of dental caries. Restriction fragment differential display polymerase chain reaction (RFDD-PCR) in conjunction with single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) was used to identify S. mutans genes with differential expression when grown in the presence of TEG at pH levels 5.5 and 7.0. Quantitative real-time PCR (q-RT PCR) was utilized to study specific gene expression patterns. TEG modulated the expression levels of glucosyltransferase B (gtfB) (involved in biofilm formation) and yfiV (a putative transcription regulator) in S. mutans. The expression patterns were dependent on the bacterial growth mode (planktonic vs. biofilm) as well as pH (5.5 vs. 7.0). The findings describe the effect of composite resin-derived BBPs on important physiological functions of S. mutans (at BBP concentration levels found in vivo), and indicate the potential influence of BBPs in biofilm formation and microbial survival on surfaces in the oral cavity."

We have recently reported that the FVIIIa C2 domain (residues 2228-2240) interacts with the FIXa Gla domain in this complex. We examined the role of this interaction in the generation of tenase activity during the process of clot formation, using a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 2228-2240. The peptide 2228-2240 inhibited FVIIIa/FIXa-mediated FX activation dose-dependently in the presence of PL by >95% (IC50; ~10 μM). This effect was significantly greater than that obtained by peptide 1804-1818 (IC50; ~180 μM) which corresponds to another FIXa-interactive site in the light chain that provides the majority of binding energy for FIXa interaction. Peptide 2228-2240 had little effect on the prothrombin time and did not inhibit FIX activation in the coagulation process mediated by FVIIa/tissue factor or FXIa, suggesting specific inhibition of the intrinsic tenase complex. Clot waveform analysis, a plasma based-assay used to evaluate the process of intrinsic coagulation, demonstrated that peptide 2228-2240 significantly depressed both maximum coagulation velocity (|min1|) and acceleration (|min2|), reflecting the propagation of clot formation, although the clotting time was only marginally prolonged. Thromboelastography, an alternative whole blood based-assay, demonstrated that the peptide inhibited clot formation time, α-angle and maximal clot firmness, but had little effect on the clotting time. Interactions of the FVIIIa C2 domain (residues 2228-2240) with the FIXa Gla domain in the tenase complex appeared to contribute essentially to the propagation of clot formation."

CD010438,0,12454546,0,Early intensive care unit intervention for trauma care: what alters the outcome?,"This review focuses on early management of multiple trauma patients with traumatic brain injury. Early usage of multislice computed tomography can substantially shorten the time spent on diagnostic workup in the emergency room and, therefore, speeds the initiation of lifesaving interventions for the control of hemorrhage. The important role of hemostatic angiographic embolization and its timing, in addition to surgical control of bleeding in patients suffering from pelvic fracture or organ lesions, is emphasized. The ongoing controversy regarding the strategy of fluid resuscitation is discussed. The concept of permissive hypotension seems to be promising but is absolutely contraindicated in patients with traumatic brain injury. Coagulation management should be guided by coagulation monitoring, including thromboelastography. A novel approach to reduce major bleeding is the application of recombinant factor VIIa. Strong effort should be directed toward the management of traumatic brain injury and the maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure. The optimization of treatment of patients with multiple trauma, including brain injury, is a multidisciplinary task."

CD010438,0,12487778,0,"Absence of compensatory platelet activation in patients with severe haemophilia, but evidence for a platelet collagen-activation defect.","Severe haemophilia is a serious, haemorrhagic disorder of the plasmatic coagulation system. In this study we investigated, whether 'compensatory' activation of the platelet coagulation system occurs in this situation. Platelet function was investigated with aggregation, adhesion and flow cytometric assays. In addition, we performed clot and platelet plug formation tests and determined endogenous thrombin potentials in patients with severe haemophilia A or B; results were compared to those of healthy controls. Platelet aggregation in response to stimulation with ADP, ristocetin and epinephrine was similar in patients and controls; aggregation in response to collagen was reduced significantly in haemophiliacs. Flow cytometric analysis of P-selectin (CD 62P) and CD 63, of the conformationally changed GP IIb/IIIa with PAC 1 and of thrombospondin bound to CD 36 (GP IV) was performed at baseline and post stimulation. Baseline expression of all markers was similar in haemophiliacs and controls. After stimulation of the platelet thrombin receptors with the thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) 6, the surface expression of all markers increased significantly; again, the expression was similar in haemophiliacs and controls. With thrombelastography and PFA 100 analysis, clot formation under low shear and platelet plug formation under high shear is measured. Both test results revealed a significantly reduced clot and platelet plug formation capacity in severe haemophiliacs. Our results did not reveal signs of enhanced platelet preactivation in haemophiliacs, indicating that baseline platelet reactivity in severe haemophilia remains in a neutral state, despite the severely haemorrhagic condition. As expected, both thrombin and clot formation capacities were impaired significantly in severe haemophilia. The reduced response to collagen-based platelet stimulation tests is indicative of a concomitant platelet function defect. This defect probably contributes to the intensity of bleeding events in patients with severe haemophilia."

Two of the patients was cleared completely, four exhibited regression of more than one-half of the lesions, and four showed only a slight improvement. The therapy did not markedly affect the granulocyte count in peripheral blood, and the beneficial clinical response was not related to the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) removed by leukophereses. During therapy, the activities of elastase, cathepsin G, lysozyme, and myeloperoxidase in PMNs were determined by spectrophotometry. PMNs isolated using a Haemonetics 30 blood-cell separator were about 50% deficient in these activities in comparison to cells obtained directly from peripheral blood. Thus, leukopheresis induces a marked degranulation of PMNs. Repeated leukophereses were found to generate significant variations in the activities of circulating PMN granule enzymes and in the levels of acid-soluble proteins. Remission or great improvement were observed in patients who, during therapy, exhibited decreased PMN elastase and cathepsin G activities, whereas a poor clinical response was accompanied by high enzymatic activities."
CD010438,0,22726088,0,Global haemostasis and point of care testing.,"The evaluation of the coagulation profile has used so far either clotting-based or chromogenic assays with different endpoints. Clotting-based techniques are the most used worldwide, and they certainly are useful for diagnosis of clotting factor deficiencies. However, the information provided is relatively limited, and therefore the individual profile of coagulation is poorly assessed. This is reflected by the weak correlation between the results of these assays and the clinical phenotype. Among the assays that benefited from technological advances, thrombin generation and thromboelastography are probably the most actively investigated, but they require specific instruments and are not fully automated. Their standardisation level is rapidly progressing, and they are progressively entering the clinical scene, with the attempt to provide additional information on the coagulation process and a meaningful clinical correlation. These inherited bleeding disorders frequently require replacement therapy using clotting factor concentrates that increase the plasma level of the missing clotting factor. The classical adjustment of the therapy is mainly based on the measurement of the plasma clotting activity of the protein administered. If one considers that a certain level of thrombin generated would predict clinical efficacy, monitoring of thrombin formation might offer new possibilities to individually predict the bleeding phenotype, select the most adapted therapeutic product and tailor the dose. The same holds true for thromboelastography/thromboelastometry which evaluate fibrin formation as well as clot resistance to fibrinolytic challenge, one step further down in the coagulation process. In this regard, these 2 assays could be seen as complementary in terms of information provided on the coagulation profile at the individual level."

Inhibitor-bypassing therapy was commenced immediately on admission. On the 17th day of treatment with activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC; FEIBA, re-bleeding occurred and thrombelastography (TEG) demonstrated resistance to therapy. Treatment was changed to recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; NovoSeven and resulted in clinical improvement together with an improvement in TEG parameters. On the 10th day of continuous infusion with NovoSeven, however, TEG again showed resistance to therapy. FEIBA infusions were re-introduced and TEG results remained satisfactory for 7 days. On day 34, however, further retroperitoneal bleeding was evident and a decline in the haemostatic efficiency of FEIBA was recorded by TEG. NovoSeven was again successfully administered for 7 days. There were no laboratory findings to indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hypercoagulability or abnormal fibrinolysis. The plasma-based clotting tests did not show any additional prolongation on the occasions when the TEG demonstrated unresponsiveness to FEIBA or NovoSeven. These findings suggested that some component of whole blood, other than plasma might have governed the TEG data. The long-term use of APCC such as FEIBA or rFVIIa, requires careful monitoring in terms of FVIII inhibitor bypassing activity as well as the tendency to DIC."

CD010438,0,8825223,0,Effects of the platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist WEB 2086 on whole blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in a thromboelastography assay.,"The effects of WEB 2086 on human blood coagulation and fibrinolysis were studied in vitro using computerized thromboelastography and native whole blood. WEB 2086 (3.0, 30, 150, and 300 microM) had no apparent effect on the split point (SP), reaction time (R) and lysis of the clot. The biKoatugulierung time (K) was prolonged, the angle (alpha) and maximum amplitude (MA) were diminished, and the overall coagulation index (TEG index) was smaller. SP and R indicate onset of coagulation with the formation of fibrin strands, suggesting that WEB 2086 had no effect on the plasma factors. Since the Lysis parameter reflects fibrinolysis, WEB 2086 had no demonstrable fibrinolytic activity. K, alpha and MA involve platelet function and the integrity of fibrin; the fact that these factors were affected to the exclusion of SP and R suggests an effect largely on platelets. There was lack of a dose-response relationship at this concentration range (3.0-300 microM), probably due to saturation of PAF receptors even at the lowest effective concentration. These findings are consistent with the known effects of WEB 2086 on platelet function and suggest that thromboelastography may be a useful tool in the study of the activity of PAF receptor antagonists on coagulation profiles. Furthermore, since WEB 2086 is a highly specific PAF receptor antagonist devoid of intrinsic activity, and the samples used were not treated with exogenous PAF, these results suggest that endogenous PAF may play a significant role in the normal clotting mechanism."

This prospective study of 45 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation was conducted to evaluate the effect on the thrombelastogram performed at the patient's actual body temperature compared with a control thrombelastogram heated in the standard fashion to 37 degrees C. Thrombelastograms were obtained after the induction of anesthesia and at various times throughout the operation when clinically indicated. A freshly drawn sample of the patient's blood was divided into two aliquots and run simultaneously on two thrombelastographs; one thrombelastograph was modified with a thermostat to perform the test at the patient's body temperature and the other was unmodified to serve as a control. The temperature of the patients in this study ranged from 36.9 degrees C to 32 degrees C. The variables of the thrombelastogram measured were: r (reaction time in minutes), r + K (coagulation time in minutes), alpha (coagulation rate in degrees), and MA (maximum amplitude in millimeters). Whenever the patient's body temperature was less than 37 degrees C, statistically significant prolongation of the reaction time, coagulation time, and decrease in the clot formation rate occurred compared with control variables at 37 degrees C. Overall means were as follows: r for control, 8.24 +/- 0.28 min; r for temperature corrected, 9.32 +/- 0.27 min; r + K for control, 15.4 +/- 0.65 min; r + K for temperature corrected, 17.5 +/- 0.81 min; and alpha for control, 39.8 +/- 1.22 degrees; alpha for temperature corrected, 37.7 +/- 1.23 degrees.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Thirty-three healthy patients admitted for minor surgery served as controls. Antithrombin III (AT III), thromboelastogram (TEG), other haemostatic parameters and the influence of dialysis treatment were assessed in DM and NDM uraemic patients. All uraemic patients were anaemic and bleeding time was slightly prolonged (NS). The level of AT III was raised in the DM group when compared in the healthy controls (P < 0.001). Prothrombin time (PT) percentage was increased in both uraemic groups (P < 0.001) in comparison with the controls. Thrombocytosis was marked in DM patients (P < 0.001) when compared with controls and NDM patients. TEG parameters were similar in all groups. Continuous peritoneal dialysis treatment (CAPD) was associated with elevated total platelet count in NDM (P < 0.05) and DM group (P < 0.05) when compared with haemodialysis (HD) patients. Also, the PT was shortened in DM patients on CAPD vs HD (P < 0.05). AT III level was elevated in NDM patients on CAPD compared with those on HD (P < 0.05). There was no difference in clinical bleeding tendency during renal transplantation. Postoperatively, one patient in NDM group suffered from thrombosis of the graft artery and transplantectomy had to be performed. Our study showed a prethrombotic state in diabetic uraemic patients admitted for renal transplantation. The increased AT III activity may protect these patients against thrombotic complications. The role of CAPD treatment requires further studies."
CD010438,0,22321860,0,[Treatment alternatives in massive hemorrhage].,"Massive hemorrhage is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in trauma patients, and is one of the most important causes in any patient following major surgery. Conventional treatment consists of volume replacement, including the transfusion of blood products, so that tissue perfusion and oxygenation may be maintained. Associated hypothermia, acidosis and coagulopathy is a lethal triad. This review focuses on the latest therapeutic management of massive hemorrhage. The authors advocate the use of crystalloids as per protocol (controlled volumes) in order to achieve a systolic blood pressure of 85mmHg. The administration of the three blood products (red cells, plasma, and platelets) should be on a 1:1:1 basis. Where possible, this in turn should be guided by thromboelastography performed at point of care near the patient. Coagulopathy can occur early and late. With the exception of tranexamic acid, the cost-benefit relationships of the hemostatic agents, such as fibrinogen, prothrombin complex, and recombinant F VII, are subject to discussion."

CD010438,0,19851087,0,Discard volume necessary for elimination of heparin flush effect on thromboelastography.,"Heparin is commonly used to prevent obstruction of indwelling arterial catheters with blood clots. It is known to affect the outcomes of analysis of coagulation parameters with thromboelastography (TEG); therefore, it has been recommended to neutralize its effect with heparinase. However, heparinase may also neutralize the effect of low molecular weight heparin and endogenous heparinoids present in critically ill patients and thus yields unreliable results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the minimal discard blood volume needed to eliminate the effect of heparin flush on TEG parameters without the use of heparinase. Ten patients with indwelling arterial catheter were included in the study. Coagulation parameters were evaluated with kaolin-activated TEG. Blood samples were obtained after discarding 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 ml of blood to eliminate the effect of heparin. We investigated the influence of the discard volume on time until the first detectable clot (R), speed of clot development (alpha angle), maximal amplitude of the measured clot and time to maximal amplitude of the measured clot. We found an increase in coagulation (reflecting the heparin elimination) with the increasing discard volume between 1 and 4 ml. This was obvious from an increase in alpha angle and maximal amplitude of the measured clot and a decrease in R and time to maximal amplitude of the measured clot (P < 0.001). However, values obtained after discarding 4, 5 and 10 ml of blood did not differ markedly. To obtain valid information about TEG parameters, it is necessary to discard volume of at least 4 ml of blood (i.e., five times the volume of catheter dead space)."

CD010438,0,20858853,0,An accompanying genetic severe deficiency of tissue factor protects mice with a protein C deficiency from lethal endotoxemia.,"Mice with a severe genetic deficiency of protein C (PC), PC(-/-)PC(tg4), display enhanced susceptibility to lethal effects of gram-negative endotoxemia induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), whereas mice severely deficient in tissue factor (TF), TF(-/-)hTF(tg), are protected from LPS-mediated lethality. In this study, we show that a simultaneous severe deficiency of TF protected low-PC mice from LPS-induced death, resulting in a survival profile similar to that experienced by wild-type (WT) mice. Plasma and whole blood coagulation assays, the latter measured by thromboelastography, demonstrated development of coagulopathies in LPS-treated mice, which were more severe in the case of the doubly deficient TF(-/-)hTF(tg)/PC(-/-)PC(tg4) mice, mainly reflecting earlier signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation in this latter cohort. Markers of inflammation were also elevated in response to LPS in both groups of mice at times just preceding death. We conclude that whereas coagulopathies are more exacerbated in LPS-treated TF(-/-)hTF(tg)/PC(-/-)PC(tg4) mice, the lowering of TF levels in mice with an accompanying severe PC deficiency confers protection against death compared with mice with a single severe PC deficiency. This suggests that proteases generated as a result of factor VIIa/TF-mediated thrombin generation play a mechanistic role in the enhanced lethality seen under very low PC conditions in an endotoxemia model in mice."

Different volumes of midtrimester and final-trimester AF were added to whole blood from nonpregnant volunteers in a series of TEG tests. The addition of both midtrimester and final-trimester AF resulted in significant decreases in reaction time (P < 0.001) and time from reaction to a fixed level of clot firmness (P < 0.05) and significant increases in angle (P < 0.05) and coagulation index (P < 0.05) values. This reflects accelerated clot initiation and propagation. There was no significant change in the maximal amplitude or % lysis at 30 and 60 min with the addition of either midtrimester or final-trimester AF.

Our data indicated that there was no correlation between RCT results and thromboelastographic variables. No single variable of RCTs and thromboelastography correlated well with the amount of chest tube drainage postoperatively. Before the onset of cardiopulmonary bypass, the most frequent abnormalities detected by thromboelastograms were fibrinolysis and hypocoagulability resulting from factor deficiency. Hypercoagulability detected by thromboelastograms occurred in 13% of patients after cardiopulmonary bypass and usually was not detected by RCTs. The incidence of false-negative thromboelastograms and RCT results in patients who had excessive hemorrhage of unknown cause was 46% and 52%, respectively. The incidence of fibrinolysis as detected by thromboelastograms was similar before and after bypass, but only 2 of the 18 patients with fibrinolysis had excessive hemorrhage postoperatively. Our results indicate that neither RCTs nor thromboelastography predicts the likelihood of excessive hemorrhage in patients after cardiopulmonary bypass.

Although many scientists and clinicians will remember the traditional tilt-tube techniques to screen for coagulation abnormalities and to monitor anticoagulant therapy, the hemostasis laboratory today uses a variety of modern technologies. These include flow cytometry, chromogenic assays, molecular typing (e.g., polymerase chain reaction), immunologic assays (e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays), functional assays of specific coagulation proteins, and platelet function analyzers. Although these advances in technology have resulted in greater capability, productivity, sensitivity, specificity, and ultimately, improvement in the clinical care of patients, controversies and limitations remain. This article highlights new and emerging technologies in hemostasis and discusses whether they have improved or are likely to improve laboratory diagnostics by specifically addressing the following: (1) Can new technologies help predict likelihood of thrombosis recurrence? (2) Has an understanding of the role of A Disintegrin-like And Metalloprotease with Thrombo Spondin type 1 motifs (ADAMTS13) in microangiopathy resulted in improved diagnostic methods for this disorder?

We hypothesized that acid-prepared mesoporous spheres (APMS) (1-2 microm diameter, 40 A pore size) might be effective vehicles for pulmonary chemotherapeutic drug delivery. To assess this, APMS, chemically modified with different surface molecules (lipid, a linker having a terminal amine group, a thiol group, or tetraethylene glycol [TEG]), were evaluated for uptake and possible cytotoxic effects after in vitro administration to murine alveolar epithelial Type II (C10) and human mesothelioma (MM) cells and after intrapleural or intranasal administration to C57Bl/6 mice. APMS coated with TEG (APMS-TEG) were most efficiently taken up by C10 and MM cells. The mechanism of cell uptake was rapid, actin-dependent, and did not involve clathrin- or caveolae-mediated mechanisms nor fusion of membrane-bound APMS with lysosomes. When injected intrapleurally in mice, APMS-TEG were taken up by both CD45-positive and -negative cells of the diaphragm, lung, and spleen, whereas APMS administered by the intranasal route were predominantly in lung epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. After intrapleural or intranasal administration, APMS were nonimmunogenic and nontoxic as evaluated by differential cell counts and lactate dehydrogenase levels in bronchoalveolar and pleural lavage fluids. In the treatment of lung and pleural diseases, APMS-TEG may be useful tools to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs or molecular constructs."

At the end of each dose period, low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, angiotensin converting enzyme, and sex hormone binding globulin were also measured, along with a systematic assessment of symptoms and signs. The investigators involved in the measurements were blinded to the dose of T4. Serum free T4 and TSH significantly correlated to the dose in each patient and in the whole group, whereas serum T3 levels were minimally affected by the dose and did not correlate with it, with free T4 or with TSH. This latter was below normal on 9 occasions, normal in 12, and above normal in 6. Serum free T4 and T3 remained within the normal range on all except 2 occasions. REE and TEG were normalized to fat-free mass (FFM). In each patient there was a significant negative correlation between REE and TSH. This correlation was maintained when all data were pooled (r2 = 0.64; P < 0.001). Also, initial REE and its change between the highest and the lowest thyroxine dose were significantly correlated with, respectively, initial serum TSH (r2 = 0.85; P < 0.001) and the change in serum TSH between the highest and the lowest dose of T4 (r2 = 0.67; P < 0.0065). REE decreased approximately 15% when TSH increased between 0.1 and 10 mU/L. In 6 of the 9 patients, TEG increased with the reduction of the dose, and higher values were associated with higher TSH levels but without reaching statistical significance (F = 2.852, P = 0.077). None of the other indices were significantly affected by the changes in dose. These results indicate that, in patients on chronic treatment with thyroxine, REE is significantly influenced by the dose of this hormone in a dose range encompassing serum TSH concentrations that are considered acceptable in the management of hypothyroid patients. In the absence of physiological or behavioral compensations, these changes in REE may be clinically relevant."
CD010438,0,17427058,0,Emerging technologies and quality assurance: the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme perspective.,"The pattern of tests employed and technologies developed within hemostasis laboratories has changed considerably within the last 10 years. These changes have presented challenges to external quality assessment (EQA) providers, including the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme (NEQAS). EQA for point-of-care devices used for monitoring oral anticoagulant therapy has focused on provision of suitable material to assess performance of devices designed for capillary blood testing, and on education of a user group not usually trained in laboratory quality control procedures. Development of novel therapeutic agents for hemophilia has presented challenges regarding standardization of assays for monitoring treatment, whereas advances related to laboratory testing and automation have not always been accompanied by improved accuracy and precision. EQA provision has also been shown to be of value in molecular genetic screening tests for thrombophilia, and in highlighting standardization issues related to D-dimer measurement in the exclusion of deep vein thrombosis. The increasing prevalence of screening tests of global hemostasis, such as thrombin generation tests and thromboelastography, presents additional challenges to EQA providers in the attempt to standardize these new and potentially beneficial technologies."
CD010438,0,21245747,0,Postoperative changes in procoagulant factors after major surgery.,"Surgical patients are primarily at an increased risk of perioperative bleeding; however, after surgery, these patients develop hypercoagulability that favors thrombotic events. Currently, the time course of postoperative coagulation is not well characterized. Thus, the aim of the present study was to provide a detailed description of the changes in procoagulant factors in patients after major surgery and to evaluate coagulation tests based on their ability to detect hypercoagulability. Fifty-one consecutive patients undergoing different types of major surgery were analyzed. Blood samples were taken preoperatively and on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 2, 3, and 6. In addition to prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), all PT-dependent and aPTT-dependent clotting factors, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and fibrinogen were obtained, and thrombelastometry and multiplate electrode aggregometry (MEA) were performed. On POD 1, the majority of clotting factors, including factors II, VII, X, XI, and XII, showed a significant decrease from baseline. Factors II, X, XI, and XII remained significantly reduced until POD 3. In contrast, starting on POD 2, fibrinogen, factor VIII, and vWF continuously increased. No relevant changes were found for PT or aPTT. Thrombelastometry revealed a continuous increase in clot firmness, and MEA demonstrated an increase in platelet aggregation on POD 6. However, absolute values remained within normal ranges, and only serial measurements showed hypercoagulation. Beginning on POD 2 after major surgery, significant hypercoagulability developed in patients. However, clinically used global coagulation tests and point-of-care devices did not reliably reflect the hypercoagulatory state."

CD010438,0,22183067,0,Comparing techniques: the use of recalcified plasma in comparison with citrated plasma alone and in combination with thrombin in ultrastructural studies.,"Fibrin plays a vital role in the coagulation process and fibrin fiber morphology can be studied using ultrastructural techniques. When studying the ultrastructure of fibrin networks, thrombin may be added to the plasma, ensuing fibrin network formation. The question that arises is whether there are differences in morphology when thrombin is added to plasma, versus morphology observed when plasma from citrated or recalcified citrated whole blood, is studied. The current study therefore aimed to compare ultrastructure of platelets and fibrin networks from these three techniques. Results indicated comparable platelet ultrastructure between smears formed from the plasma of citrated blood and that of the citrated recalcified blood. This method might give us further information regarding the 'natural state' fibrin assembly and association with platelets, when studying haemostasis. However, when studying the ultrastructure of fibrin networks, the addition of thrombin is necessary to form an expansive, fully coagulated layer of fibrin fibers."
CD010438,0,20978994,0,Global hemostasis in pregnancy: are we using thromboelastography to its full potential?,"Pregnancy is a unique situation where significant physiological changes in all maternal organ systems take place. Most of these changes return to normal after delivery. During normal pregnancy the hemostatic balance changes in the direction of hypercoagulability, thus decreasing bleeding complications at time of delivery. The pregnancy-associated hypercoagulability sets a foundation for hemostatic abnormalities during pregnancy and may be associated with pregnancy complications. Assessment of the hemostatic status in pregnancy and its complications can be critical to diagnosis and management not only within the obstetric ward but in trauma, anesthesia, and other situations. Conventional global tests such as prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time cannot define this status appropriately, and full assessment requires measurements of several parameters. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a global hemostatic test that can analyze both coagulation and fibrinolysis. The technique has been available since the 1940s, but only recently has it shown great impact within the clinical practice arena. TEG measures the interactive dynamic coagulation process from the initial fibrin formation to platelet interaction and clot strengthening to fibrinolysis, which makes it superior to other conventional tests. In addition, TEG can guide therapy by documenting changes in coagulation in vitro before a therapy is instituted and also by helping the clinician make critical decisions. Despite the clear value as a test for monitoring hemostatic status of pregnancy-related complications, TEG is still underused for reasons such as poor awareness regarding the technique and interpretations, lack of full standardization, and the unavailability of large clinical studies. However, the fact remains that TEG is undoubtedly attractive to both researchers and clinicians, particularly in a point-of-care setting. We hope that much more investment is directed to TEG studies in both experimental and clinical fields to improve applications and promote use, especially with respect to clinical decision making in pregnancy-related complications."
CD010438,0,20978996,0,Quality assurance and quality control of thrombelastography and rotational Thromboelastometry: the UK NEQAS for blood coagulation experience.,"Global hemostasis devices are currently being employed in operating rooms to assess the bleeding risk and outcomes for patients undergoing surgery. Two devices currently available are the TEG (Thromboelastograph; Haemoscope Corp., Niles, IL) and the ROTEM (Rotation Thromboelastometer; Pentapharm GmbH, Munich, Germany). Both measure the speed of clot formation, the strength of the clot when formed, and clot fibrinolysis kinetics. The two devices use different parameters so no cross comparisons of results can be made. The devices are usually operated by a member of the operating team and not a laboratory scientist; thus their testing and performance is generally not laboratory controlled, despite quality control being required to ensure reliable results. The UK National External Quality Assessment Scheme (NEQAS) for Blood Coagulation has undertaken a series of exercises evaluating the provision of External Quality Assessment (EQA) material for these devices. A series of four studies have taken place using lyophilized plasmas as the test material. Up to 18 TEG users and 10 ROTEM users have been involved in testing two samples per study, for a total of eight samples tested. The samples were normal plasmas, factor VIII or XI deficient samples, or normal plasmas spiked with heparin. The precision of the tests varied greatly for both devices, with coefficients of variances ranging from 7.1 to 39.9% for TEG and 7.0 to 83.6% for ROTEM. Some centers returned results that were sufficiently different from those obtained by other participants to predict alterations in patient management decisions. Our data indicate that regular EQA/proficiency testing is needed for these devices."
CD010438,0,2097752,0,[Effect of biguanides on the indicators of thrombelastography and the level of lactic acid in diabetes mellitus].,"The authors analyze the results of examinations of 232 patients with diabetes mellitus; 48 of these suffering from type I diabetes and 64 from type II diabetes were treated with biguanides. Thromboelastograms were recorded in the presence of hyperglycemia and repeatedly during stable compensation of diabetes, and their values were analyzed with due consideration for therapy administered. Since biguanides are known to induce lactate acidosis, blood serum lactic acid levels were measured when the patients were hospitalized, in the presence of hyperglycemia, and then after a standard exercise test (to detect latent acidosis). When stable compensation of diabetes mellitus was achieved, the examination scheme described before was repeated, i. e. lactic acid measurements before and after exercise test, with due consideration for the therapy administered. Biguanides were found to be conducive to normalization of thrombelastogram values, not elevating the blood serum content of lactic acid even after exercise test."
CD010438,0,20978990,0,Clinical utility of thromboelastography: one size does not fit all.,"Coagulation management requires the balancing of different components that contribute to clot formation. These components include the interactions between platelets, procoagulant, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic factors. The cause of bleeding or thrombotic events is often multifactorial; however, the tests clinicians most frequently use to assess hemostasis do not reflect the complexity of the coagulation system. The paucity of global measurements of hemostasis has resulted in either an empirical or a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment. In contrast, thromboelastography is a test that monitors the different phases of clot formation and lysis, providing the clinician with a tool for making informed therapeutic decisions. This review provides an overview of thromboelastography in the management of hypocoagulable and hypercoagulable conditions."
CD010438,0,20978991,0,Standardization of thromboelastography: values and challenges.,"Laboratory evaluation of hemostasis has been performed using plasma for several decades. The cell-based model of coagulation has now led to renewed interest in the global assays of coagulation such as thrombin generation and thromboelastography. These tests have remained as research tools, however, because of the lack of studies to demonstrate their reliability. The number of publications in the field of thromboelastography is growing daily, and many areas of clinical medicine are targeting the ability of this assay to evaluate in real time the process of coagulation and fibrin polymerization. It is clear that the methods employed by different investigators differ significantly, and therefore the results are not comparable. It is therefore critical to standardize the assay to achieve clinical relevance. This article summarizes the TEG-ROTEM Working Group's efforts to try and standardize thromboelastography and the challenges faced in this process. Although this has been the first effort to standardize this test, it is extremely important to continue this work, so that we may investigate the usefulness and possible applications of thromboelastography in evaluating the process of hemostasis."
CD010438,0,20978992,0,Critical factors contributing to the thromboelastography trace.,"The thromboelastography trace provides a graphical and numerical representation of the viscoelastic changes associated with fibrin polymerization. When used with whole blood, the shape of this trace is a composite of the effects of white and red cell content and composition, platelet number and function, fibrinogen concentration, as well as coagulation protein function and balance. The trace is also influenced by pharmacological agents such as anticoagulants, antiplatelet therapy, and coagulation factor supplementation. As such the main role of this technology has been as a point-of-care device to guide transfusion of blood components. Recently the technology has moved from the cardiac and hepatic surgical settings, where most of the early work was focused, into other areas of hemostatic monitoring. New applications for pharmaceutical monitoring and patient screening are being explored. This review gives a broad overview of the applications of the technology. In particular it considers the factors that most influence the characteristics of the trace, be they preanalytical, analytical, or clinical."
CD010438,0,20978993,0,Coagulation abnormalities in the trauma patient: the role of point-of-care thromboelastography.,"Current recommendations for resuscitation of the critically injured patient are limited by a lack of point-of-care (POC) assessment of coagulation status. Accordingly, the potential exists for indiscriminant blood component administration. Furthermore, although thromboembolic events have been described shortly after injury, the time sequence of post-injury coagulation changes is unknown. Our current understanding of hemostasis has shifted from a classic view, in which coagulation was considered a chain of catalytic enzyme reactions, to the cell-based model (CBM), representing the interplay between the cellular and plasma components of clot formation. Thromboelastography (TEG), a time-sensitive dynamic assay of the viscoelastic properties of blood, closely parallels the CBM, permitting timely, goal-directed restoration of hemostasis via POC monitoring of coagulation status. TEG-based therapy allows for goal-directed blood product administration in trauma, with potential avoidance of the complications resulting from overzealous component administration, as well as the ability to monitor post-injury coagulation status and thromboprophylaxis. This overview addresses coagulation status and thromboprophylaxis management in the trauma patient and the emerging role of POC TEG."

CD010438,0,10608724,0,Evaluation of efficacy in platelet collection by the Haemonetics Component Collection System.,"Platelet concentrate product derived from plateletpheresis from a single donor is preferable in terms of reducing the risks of adverse reactions in platelet transfusion. This study evaluated the status of platelet transfusion and the efficacy and safety of plateletpheresis machines. The average number of donors of platelet product per patient has been decreasing and recently reached nearly 1.0; however, some patients still receive multiple random donor platelet products. Platelet collection efficacy was comparable between the Haemonetics Component Collection System (CCS) and the Multi Component System (Multi). However, the CCS has been shown to be effective in terms of processed blood volume and procedure time, especially in donors with lower hematocrits. These results suggest that the CCS may be preferable and safer for donors with lower hematocrits and lighter body weights. Blood centers should collect platelets more effectively to achieve platelet transfusion with the use of platelets derived from a single donor using effective equipment."
CD010438,0,22527290,0,Recombinant factor VIIa treatment for asymptomatic factor VII deficient patients going through major surgery.,"Factor VII deficiency is the most common among the rare autosomal recessive coagulation disorders worldwide. In factor VII deficient patients, the severity and clinical manifestations cannot be reliably determined by factor VII levels. Severe bleeding tends to occur in individuals with factor VII activity levels of 2% or less of normal. Patients with 2-10% factor VII vary between asymptomatic to severe life threatening haemorrhages behaviour. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is the most common replacement therapy for congenital factor VII deficiency. However, unlike haemophilia patients for whom treatment protocols are straight forward, in asymptomatic factor VII deficiency patients it is still debatable. In this study, we demonstrate that a single and very low dose of recombinant factor VIIa enabled asymptomatic patients with factor VII deficiency to go through major surgery safely. This suggestion was also supported by thrombin generation, as well as by thromboelastometry."
CD010438,0,17473575,0,Efficacy of anticoagulants and platelet inhibitors in cancer-induced thrombosis.,"The efficacy of anticoagulants, low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), the antiplatelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist, or combinations on cancer-activated thrombosis was determined using thromboelastography. The LMWHs tinzaparin and enoxaparin (0.179, 1.79, 17.9 microg) were incubated in human citrated whole blood (n = 4) and then activated by calcium chloride (11 mmol/l) or Colo205 (cell count 10). Concentrations of 9.9, 17.9 and 179 microg glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist, XV454, and combinations with each LMWH were carried out and activated under the same conditions. The experiment was repeated with tissue factor substituting for the Colo205 to induce platelet/fibrin clot formation. Parameters tested in the thrombelastography analysis included clotting time, rate of clot formation due to fibrin formation, clot kinetics, and clot strength related to platelet count (maximum amplitude). Tinzaparin (1.79 microg), enoxaparin (1.79 microg), and XV454 (17.9 microg) significantly reduced the angle by 64, 26 and 27%, respectively, in cancer-induced clotting. Significant reductions in the maximum amplitude occurred in tinzaparin 1.79 microg (31%), enoxaparin 1.79 microg (11%), and XV454 17.9 microg (59%). An overall antithrombotic additive effect occurred when each LMWH (1.79 microg) was combined with XV454 (17.9 microg). The results between cancer-activated and tissue factor-activated blood were similar. The study concludes that an additive effect is present between LMWHs and a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist in reducing cancer-mediated thrombosis."

Early recognition of blood loss, control of bleeding and restoration of circulating volume are critical to the management of trauma shock, and transfusion of blood components is a key intervention. Vital signs may be inadequate to determine the need for transfusion, and resuscitation regimens targeting vital signs may be harmful in the context of uncontrolled bleeding. This article addresses current concepts in haemostatic resuscitation. Recent guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of coagulopathy in major trauma, and the role of component and adjuvant therapies, are considered. Finally, the potential role of thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry are discussed."
CD010438,0,17334509,0,Platelet activation via PAR4 is involved in the initiation of thrombin generation and in clot elasticity development.,"Thrombin is a pivotal enzyme formed in the coagulation cascade and an important and potent platelet activator. The two protease-activated thrombin receptors on human platelets are denoted PAR1 and PAR4. The physiological relevance of PAR4 is still unclear, as both aggregation and secretion can be accomplished by PAR1 activation alone. In the present study we have investigated the role of PARs in platelet activation, blood coagulation, clot elasticity and fibrinolysis. Flow cytometry, free oscillation rheometry and thrombin generation measurements were used to analyze blood or platelet-rich plasma from healthy individuals. Maximum PAR1 activation with the peptide SFLLRN gave fewer fibrinogen-binding platelets with lower mean fluorescent intensity than maximum PAR4 activation with AYPGKF. Inhibition of any of the receptors prolonged clotting times. However, PAR1 is more important for fibrinolysis; inhibition of this receptor prolonged all the steps in the fibrinolytic process. Clot elasticity decreased significantly when the PAR4 receptor was inhibited. In the thrombin generation measurements, PAR4 inhibition delayed the thrombin generation start and peak, but did not affect the total amount of thrombin generated. PAR1 inhibition had no significant impact on thrombin generation. We found that PAR4 is most likely activated by low concentrations of thrombin during the initial phase of thrombin generation and is of importance to the clotting time. Furthermore, we suggest that the PAR4 receptor may have a physiological role in the stabilisation of the coagulum."
CD010438,0,6678359,0,Blood coagulation studies in domestic pigs (Hanover breed) and minipigs (Goettingen breed).,"Blood coagulation studies were performed on 60 Hanover domestic pigs ready for slaughter and a total of 84 Goettingen minipigs. A tendency to hypercoagulability was found in these pigs, expressed in a shortened PTT, r- and k-time in the thromboelastogram and a slightly reduced plasminogen and plasmin level. Many values were similar to those of man. Thrombin time was longer. This may be due more to enhanced formation of fibrin degradation products (anti-thrombin VI) than to greater amounts of endogenous heparin being released. The longer reptilase and thrombin coagulase times support this. The thrombocyte count differed only slightly. The findings suggest that the Goettingen minipigs and Hanover domestic pig are suitable animals for comparative blood coagulation studies."

For apheresis platelets, the concentrates were obtained using the Haemonetics MCS 3P device. For the random method, platelets were obtained by two phase centrifugation, in the Heraeus Cryofuge 8500 I device using the Kansuk 3-way bags which permit storage for five days. 1620 plateletpheresis units prepared by apheresis, and 9838 units prepared by the random method, were included in the study. Of the 11,458 PCs studied. 32 (0.27%) were false positives and 24 (0.2%) were real positives. All of the positive results occurred in platelets prepared by the random method. C. xerosis and S. epidermidis, S. hominis, Alpha-hemolytic streptococci, all flora of the skin, were isolated in the contaminated concentrates. The risk of microbial contamination of PCs, prepared both by apheresis and from whole blood, continues at a low rate although the products were collected into specific bags following rules including appropriate disinfection of the skin, correct centrifugation collection time and optimal storage conditions including temperature and agitation. These results again emphasize the importance of: obeying phlebotomy rules and hand disinfection of the person who collects the blood as well as the need for careful skin decontamination of the donor, during donation."

Baboons (n=6) were placed on a heparin-coated pediatric closed-circuit cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) system and cooled to 18 degrees C. A control group (n=7) underwent similar protocol with a non heparin-coated circuit and received systemic heparin. Either low flow at 0.5 L/min/m 2 (n=8; 4 in each group) or circulatory arrest (n=5; 2 in experimental group and 3 in control group) was used during deep hypothermia. Samples for complete blood count (CBC), hepatic and renal function tests, activated clotting time (ACT) and thrombelastogram (TEG) were obtained before, during, and after bypass. Cerebral blood flow was measured using Xenon-133 and autopsies were performed to assess end-organ damage. The ACT returned to baseline in both groups, and renal and hepatic function were within normal limits. There was no significant difference between the TEG values between the groups post bypass. Fibrin split products were absent and fibrinogen levels were normal in both groups following bypass. Cerebral blood flows were equivalent in both groups before and after bypass, although in the heparin-coated group cerebral blood flows were significantly higher during CPB. There were no brain histologic changes in the heparin-coated group and one focal cortical infarct in the control group. This study suggests that hypothermia induced a state of anticoagulation that did not result in thrombus formation or end organ dysfunction during CPB with a heparin-coated circuit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The aim of this study was i) to evaluate the procoagulant activity of human adult liver-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (hALPCs), ii) to compare it to other mesenchymal cells of extra-hepatic (bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and skin fibroblasts) or liver origin (liver myofibroblasts), and iii) to determine the ways this activity could be modulated. Using a whole blood coagulation test (thromboelastometry), we demonstrated that all analyzed cell types exhibit procoagulant activity. The hALPCs pronounced procoagulant activity was associated with an increased tissue factor and a decreased tissue factor pathway inhibitor expression as compared with hepatocytes. At therapeutic doses, the procoagulant effect of hALPCs was inhibited by neither antithrombin activators nor direct factor Xa inhibitor or direct thrombin inhibitors individually. However, concomitant administration of an antithrombin activator or direct factor Xa inhibitor and direct thrombin inhibitor proved to be a particularly effective combination for controlling the procoagulant effects of hALPCs both in vitro and in vivo. The results suggest that this dual antithrombotic therapy should also improve the efficacy of cell transplantation in humans."

CD010438,0,19171115,0,Mechanisms of antiphospholipid-induced thrombosis: effects on the protein C system.,"An acquired resistance to activated protein C (APC) has been demonstrated in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Recent studies report interactions between beta2 glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) and prothrombin-binding antibodies and the protein C system. Some aPL in patients recognize one or more conformational epitopes shared by beta2GPI and catalytic domains of APC. Both beta2GPI and anti-prothrombin antibodies are associated with APC resistance. Several clinical studies have focused on an association between aPL and APC resistance, determined by classic activated partial thromboplastin time-based tests. It has been shown in most studies that APC resistance was associated with lupus anticoagulants. APC resistance is also associated with thrombosis, especially venous thromboembolism. Several recent studies have reported a novel integrated approach of coagulation using calibrated automated thrombography. This technique allows an approach of APC sensitivity without interference with lupus anticoagulants. Clinical associations between APC resistance and thromboembolic events have been demonstrated."
CD010438,0,11030529,0,Thromboelastograph assay for measuring the mechanical strength of fibrin sealant clots.,"In order to provide sustained hemostasis or tissue sealing, fibrin sealants must generate adhesive clots with mechanical properties capable of resisting forces, such as shear, that might break or tear the clot. Commercial preparations of fibrin sealants should generate clots of adequate and consistent mechanical strength. The mechanical strength of fibrin sealants is often measured as bonding strength in in vivo or ex vivo animal wound models. These tests can be useful predictors of clinical efficacy. However, these, as well as many in vitro tensile strength tests for fibrin sealant, tend to be laboratory specific and require extensive reagent preparation time and analyst training. The thromboelastograph has historically been used to screen for plasma protein and platelet disorders that lead to defective clot formation. The authors have developed a simple in vitro test, using a standard thromboelastograph that can provide reliable, reproducible information on the rheology of clots generated by fibrin sealant preparations. Using this method, the shear strength of fibrin sealant clots was measured and shown to correlate with the fibrinogen, but not the thrombin, concentration in the sealant. Shear strength was also shown to correlate with the sealant concentration of the fibrin cross-linking proenzyme, factor XIII. Sealants containing lysine, which can act as an alternate substrate for factor XIII enzyme and prevent efficient fibrin chain cross-linking, were shown by this method to generate clots of substantially reduced shear strength. The method distinguished between thrombin-catalyzed clot formation and other fibrinogen clotting mechanisms as evidenced by the significantly lower shear strength associated with batroxobin-generated fibrin clots."

CD010438,0,16102110,0,Evaluation of the profile of thrombin generation during the process of whole blood clotting as assessed by thrombelastography.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility of linking the tracing of whole blood clotting in a thrombelastograph (TEG) hemostasis system with the generation of thrombin assessed by thrombin/antithrombin complex (TAT). Citrated whole blood containing corn trypsin inhibitor from volunteers was clotted in the presence of CaCl2 and tissue factor. Clotting was monitored with the eight channels of a TEG system. At different time points, the whole blood TEG reaction cups were kept in a cold quenching solution, centrifuged, and the supernatants were kept at -80 degrees C until assayed for TAT by ELISA. The total thrombus generation (TTG) was calculated from the first derivative of the TEG waveform and was compared with thrombin generation measured by TAT. The two vector values--the TAT thrombin generation data and the corresponding TEG TTG--were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and linear, non-linear and natural log (ln) transformation of TAT values for least-squares goodness-of-fit curves. The best least-squares fit is an exponential curve. Linearizing using the ln of the TAT thrombin generation variable produces the same r (0.94) as of the exponential curve. The prediction equation is y = 8.0465 + 0.0005x (P < or = 0.0001), where y is the TAT thrombin generation variable in the ln transformation and x is the TEG TTG variable. The high magnitude of r and the high significance of the prediction equation demonstrate the high efficacy of the prediction of TAT thrombin generation by the use of TEG TTG."

CD010438,0,2015038,0,[Preparation of leukocyte-depleted human platelet concentrates by centrifugation and filtration of a pool of sterilely connected buffy-coats].,"We describe a new method for the preparation of standardised therapeutic doses of leukocyte depleted platelets. The first step is to remove the buffy-coat from whole blood units drawn on triple Siamese ACD/SAGM bags (Maco-Pharma) by means of a Compomat (NPBI). The second step is to connect (SCD Haemonetics) six buffy-coats and one plasma to a special kit (Maco-Pharma) including a PALL PL 100 filter; after centrifugation, the supernatant platelet concentrate is extracted, filtered and recovered in a 2 litre TOTM PVC bag. The volume, the number of platelets and leukocytes of these pools are measured. A comparison of these parameters is made with therapeutic doses prepared in the same way without filtration. Besides, pH measurements up to the 6th day of storage and bacteriological checks are carried out. The results show: no platelet loss related to filtration; a synergy between the preparation process out of buffy-coats and the filtration: so each dose contains less than 10(6) leukocytes; a good pH level allowing the storage for five days as it is associated to the bacteriological safety of the functionally closed system. This technique makes it possible to transfuse only leukocyte depleted platelet concentrates. In addition, it offers new prospects for standardisation and quality improvement."
CD010438,0,8165628,0,Effect of dried ginger on human platelet function.,"Eight healthy male volunteers took part in a randomised double blind study of the effects of 2 g dried ginger or placebo capsules on platelet function. Bleeding time, platelet count, thromboelastography and whole blood platelet aggregometry were performed before, 3 h, and 24 h after the capsules. There were no differences between ginger and placebo in any of the variables measured. It is concluded that the effect of ginger on thromboxane synthetase activity is dose dependent, or only occurs with fresh ginger, and that upto 2 g of dried ginger is unlikely to cause platelet dysfunction when used therapeutically."
CD010438,0,22098495,0,Biological determinants of bleeding in patients with heterozygous factor XI deficiency.,"Bleeding risk is not predictable in patients with factor XI (FXI; F11) deficiency. In this prospective study, our objectives were to determine the biological determinants for bleeding risk in patients with heterozygous FXI deficiency. Patients were classified as either bleeding patients or non-bleeding patients by calculating the bleeding score (BS) described for von Willebrand disease. Primary haemostasis, thrombin generation, thromboelastometry, procoagulant proteins, inhibitors, fibrinolysis, and F11 gene mutations were compared between bleeding and non-bleeding patients. Thirty-nine patients were included. BS significantly correlated with clinical assessment (P=0·001), and a score over 3 discriminated between bleeding (n=15) and non-bleeding (n=24) patients (P=0·034). Despite normal values, von Willebrand factor (VWF) and thrombomodulin (TM) plasma levels were significantly lower in bleeding patients than non-bleeding patients [ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo)=80·6±29·7 iu/dl and 101·8±29·5iu/dl respectively, P=0·043; and VWF antigen (VWF:Ag)=84·0±28·0 iu/dl and 106·3±36·1 iu/dl respectively, P=0·035; and TM=17·7±11·7ng/ml and 23·6±9·7ng/ml respectively, P=0·043]. When considering BS as a continuous variable, only VWF:RCo remained significant (P=0·042), which accounted for 11% of the variability in BS."

The following parameters were studied without and with exposure to cold conditions: hemodynamics (finger photoplethysmography), red cell deformability (filtration test), various clotting variables (prothrombin activity, antithrombin III, plasma fibrinogen, partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, thrombelastogram), and clinical symptomatology. After treatment 7 of the 11 patients showed a distinct improvement of peripheral blood flow and of symptoms (decrease or removal of asphyxia attacks, pain, color change) under basal conditions, as well as after exposure to cold. Red cell filtration was significantly (p less than 0.05) improved, increasing by 35% under normal conditions and by 30% after exposure to cold. Positive changes were also found in respect to antithrombin III (increase) and plasma fibrinogen (decrease). The thrombelastogram was unchanged. Clinical and instrumental improvements were probably ascribable to better microcirculatory flow due to increased red cell deformability, reduced viscosity, and decreased fibrinogen, all capable of influencing in various degrees the blood flow at the microcirculatory level."

The current study evaluated this technique in patients undergoing repeat cardiac operations. Fifty-two patients undergoing repeat myocardial revascularization and/or valve replacement were evaluated in a prospective randomized controlled study design. Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was harvested after the induction of anesthesia in the experimental group. After reversal of heparin, each patient received his or her autologous plasma. Patients in the control group did not have plasmapheresis and received standard transfusion therapy if coagulation variables were abnormal and a coagulopathy was clinically evident. Routine coagulation tests, thromboelastography (TEG), perioperative bleeding, and transfusion requirements were compared in the two groups. Forty-four patients completed the study. A significantly larger volume of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) was transfused in the PRP group than in the control group (P = 0.03). Platelet and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions did not differ between the two groups. Mediastinal tube drainage did not differ between the two groups. During PRP infusion, 60% of the patients required treatment for moderate hypotension (mean arterial pressure [MAP] < 60 mm Hg). Only 16% of control patients required treatment for hypotension during the comparable time period (P < 0.05). No patient who completed the study returned to the operating room for postoperative bleeding. These data suggest that PRP did not reduce postbypass bleeding or transfusion requirements in repeat cardiac surgical patients. Moreover, the incidence of hypotension during PRP reinfusion introduces a potential risk to the procedure in the absence of any obvious benefit."

The information obtained from most overall assays to measure the haemostatic response to inhibitor-bypassing agents is limited to the initial phase of blood coagulation (clotting time measurement) or the formation of a solidifying clot followed by fibrinolysis (thrombelastography), and excludes the real endpoint of thrombin generation. Thrombin generation assays (TGAs) measure the whole kinetics of thrombin generation even after the clot formation, and thus assess all activating and inactivating systems of coagulation. Therefore, TGAs are not only becoming a universal tool to improve understanding of haemostasis and to investigate biochemical principles of the haemostatic system, but are also evolving as a powerful prognostic and monitoring tool for inhibitor bypassing therapies."

CD010438,0,17498072,0,Sequential therapy with activated prothrombin complex concentrates and recombinant FVIIa in patients with severe haemophilia and inhibitors: update of our previous experience.,"Haemophilia patients with inhibitors can develop bleeding episodes, which are refractory to monotherapy with either recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) or activated prothrombin complex concentrates (APCC). Management of such bleeds is often difficult. We previously reported the safety of using a combination of rFVIIa and APCC given in sequential fashion. In this report, we update our experience with sequential therapy. A retrospective review of medical records was conducted including all reports of sequential therapy defined as receiving both rFVIIa and APCC within 6 h. Data extracted included demographic data, treatment prior to and following hospital admission, clinical data including type and location of bleed, response to therapy, physical examination and laboratory data. In addition, for some patients, thromboelastography was performed to document the effect of sequential therapy on clot formation characteristics. Four patients comprising 35 admissions, 209 hospital days and 115 days of sequential therapy were included in the updated dataset. No patient developed thrombosis or overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) although elevations in the D-dimer above 5 microg mL(-1) were noted in 42% of the courses that lasted >3 days. Efficacy is suggested by the fact that patients had resolution of their bleeds after a median of 3 days of sequential therapy after failing to respond to a median of 3 days of monotherapy. Thromboelastography demonstrated an additive effect. Sequential therapy is a safe, potentially efficacious approach in the management of refractory bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia and inhibitors."
CD010438,0,22523283,0,Mechanisms of attenuation of abdominal sepsis induced acute lung injury by ascorbic acid.,"Bacterial infections of the lungs and abdomen are among the most common causes of sepsis. Abdominal peritonitis often results in acute lung injury (ALI). Recent reports demonstrate a potential benefit of parenteral vitamin C [ascorbic acid (AscA)] in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Therefore we examined the mechanisms of vitamin C supplementation in the setting of abdominal peritonitis-mediated ALI. We hypothesized that vitamin C supplementation would protect lungs by restoring alveolar epithelial barrier integrity and preventing sepsis-associated coagulopathy. Male C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with a fecal stem solution to induce abdominal peritonitis (FIP) 30 min prior to receiving either AscA (200 mg/kg) or dehydroascorbic acid (200 mg/kg). Variables examined included survival, extent of ALI, pulmonary inflammatory markers (myeloperoxidase, chemokines), bronchoalveolar epithelial permeability, alveolar fluid clearance, epithelial ion channel, and pump expression (aquaporin 5, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, epithelial sodium channel, and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase), tight junction protein expression (claudins, occludins, zona occludens), cytoskeletal rearrangements (F-actin polymerization), and coagulation parameters (thromboelastography, pro- and anticoagulants, fibrinolysis mediators) of septic blood. FIP-mediated ALI was characterized by compromised lung epithelial permeability, reduced alveolar fluid clearance, pulmonary inflammation and neutrophil sequestration, coagulation abnormalities, and increased mortality. Parenteral vitamin C infusion protected mice from the deleterious consequences of sepsis by multiple mechanisms, including attenuation of the proinflammatory response, enhancement of epithelial barrier function, increasing alveolar fluid clearance, and prevention of sepsis-associated coagulation abnormalities. Parenteral vitamin C may potentially have a role in the management of sepsis and ALI associated with sepsis."

Autologous plasma was retrieved by plasma saver post induction of anesthesia. Every patient received induced hypotensive anesthesia during the operation. Whole blood coagulation status was quantitated by using thromboelastography (TEG). Blood samples for TEG were obtained before induction of anesthesia, after closure of peritoneum, and 2 hours post autologous plasma transfusion or 2 hours post peritoneum closure. Most parameters measured by TEG showed improved coagulation status in autologous plasma transfusion group. We concluded that coagulation change was minimal during induced hypotension, and improved coagulation was obtained 2 hours post autologous plasma transfusion during radical hysterectomy with BPLND surgery."

The treatment options in GT are limited. The aim of this study was to test the effect of GT blood supplementation with fibrinogen and factor XIII on thrombin generation, blood clotting, and fibrinolysis. Whole blood samples of GT patients and normal donors treated with eptifibatide (GT model) were subjected to clotting by CaCl(2) and tissue factor. Thrombin generation was measured in platelet-rich plasma. Clot formation and tPA-induced fibrinolysis were evaluated in whole blood by rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Blood was supplemented with fibrinogen (3 g/L) and/or FXIII (2 IU/mL). Thrombin generation analysis of blood derived from GT model and GT patients revealed decreased endogenous thrombin potential and peak height and extended lag time compared to control. However, this method was not sensitive to blood spiking with fibrinogen and FXIII. ROTEM revealed lower maximum clot firmness (MCF) and area under curve (AUC) in the blood of GT model and GT patients. In the absence of exogenous tPA, blood spiking with fibrinogen markedly enhanced clot quality while FXIII had no effect. Combination of fibrinogen and FXIII did not add to the effect of fibrinogen. In contrast, by the addition of tPA, both fibrinogen and FXIII separately and, to more extent, in combination enhanced clot quality as well as resistance against tPA-induced fibrinolysis (increasing MCF, AUC, and lysis onset time). In conclusion, fibrinogen and FXIII exerted stimulation of blood clotting and inhibition of fibrinolysis. Treating normal blood with eptifibatide mimics the changes of coagulopathy in GT blood."
CD010438,0,22273511,0,The effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on platelet function in whole blood and platelet concentrates.,"Several studies report that patients who are treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for depression may have increased risk of bleeding, particularly from the gastrointestinal tract. This may be related to low intraplatelet serotonin concentrations. Several blood banks do not store platelets from donors using SSRIs for transfusion, although the possible effects of SSRIs on platelet storage are not documented. We conducted a case-control pilot study of apheresis platelet concentrates prepared from donors using SSRIs (n=8) and from donors without medication (n=10). The platelet concentrates were stored for 5 days. Light transmission aggregometry (LTA), thrombelastography (TEG), and flow cytometric analyses were preformed for in vitro measurements of platelet function. Platelet function and platelet serotonin content were investigated in whole blood and in platelet concentrates stored for up to 5 days. LTA, TEG, and flow cytometric analysis of glycoprotein expression did not reveal any significant differences between the two groups. All 18 platelet concentrates performed well according to the standards set for platelet quality in relation to transfusion. Blood donors using SSRIs had significantly lower platelet serotonin compared to blood donors without medication. The results from our pilot study indicate that platelets from donors using SSRIs may be suitable for transfusion after storage for 5 days, but further laboratory and clinical studies are necessary to confirm this."

Intraoperative bleeding can be substantial and related to both surgical and nonsurgical causes. A less common but previously reported phenomenon is intraoperative cardiopulmonary thromboembolism precipitating major patient morbidity and mortality. In this paper, we present four cases of intraoperative thromboembolism during OLT. These cases were performed without the concomitant use of antifibrinolytic drugs.

Possible causes of thromboembolism, clinical management, use of thromboelastography, and the role of antifibrinolytic drugs are discussed."
CD010438,0,15506032,0,Argatroban as an alternative to heparin in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuits.,"We investigated the anticoagulant effects of argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, versus heparin in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits. Three sham circuits were prepared according to our hospital's standard practice and run for six hours simultaneously. Two circuits were anticoagulated with argatroban (one with heparin in the wet prime and one without). One circuit had heparin in the initial prime and was then anticoagulated with heparin. We measured thrombin generation (prothrombin fragment 1+2, D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin complexes), activated clotting times (ACTs) and partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs), and monitored thrombus formation using thromboelastography. ACTs were >1000 s in each circuit throughout assessment. No clot initiation was detected by thromboelastography. Thrombin generation was decreased in circuits anticoagulated with argatroban versus heparin, despite aPTTs being less prolonged. These results suggest that argatroban may be more efficacious than heparin for anticoagulation in ECMO. Additional studies are warranted to further evaluate argatroban in this setting."

Blood specimens from 25 women with newly diagnosed gynecologic malignancies and from 21 age-matched controls were analyzed. Hypercoagulability is defined by a short R value (min), a short K value (min), an elevated maximum amplitude (MA) value (mm), and a broad alpha-angle (degrees). A two-tailed, two-sample t-test was used for statistical analysis. When compared with specimens from age-matched controls, specimens from women with gynecologic malignancies demonstrated values consistent with hypercoagulability. The specific parameters are presented as a mean (+/- SD). Patients with gynecologic malignancies were found to have a short R value (7.1 +/- 2.1 vs. 11.8 +/- 1.8 min; P < 0.001), a short K value (3.1 +/- 0.9 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.9 min; P < 0.001), a prolonged MA value (64.7 +/- 5.4 vs. 58.8 +/- 6.1 mm; P = 0.001), and a greater alpha-angle (70.6 +/- 5.3 vs. 61.6 +/- 4.9 degrees ; P < 0.001). Detection of hypercoagulability as measured by thromboelastography is statistically more common among women with gynecologic malignancies compared with age-matched controls.

CD010438,0,22552295,0,Streptococcus gordonii FSS2 Challisin affects fibrin clot formation by digestion of the αC region and cleavage of the N -terminal region of the Bβ chains of fibrinogen.,"Bacteria within endocarditis vegetations are encased in fibrin matrix that is resistant to resolution. We have previously shown that FSS2 Challisin, a serine protease from Streptococcus gordonii, is able to hydrolyse the Aα and Bβ chains of fibrinogen and has potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity. The alteration in the structure of fibrin formed from FSS2 Challisin-degraded fibrinogen may therefore contribute to the resistant fibrin matrix. To this end, we have investigated the specific interactions of FSS2 Challisin with fibrinogen. FSS2 Challisin extensively degrades the αC region of fibrinogen Aα chains, hydrolysing both the αC-domain and αC-connnector. Additionally, the N-terminal region of the Bβ chains is cleaved twice, at Leu19 and Ser28, removing the B fibrinopeptides and 'B' knobs. Substrate analysis indicates FSS2 Challisin has specific requirement for proline two residues before the cleavage point and a neutral or basic un-branched amino acid preceding the cleavage point. Fibrin formation by thrombin was modified and the initiation of fibrinolysis extended, in FSS2 Challisin-treated plasma clots. Digestion of fibrinogen by FSS2 Challisin prior to thrombin action increased fiber density and fiber branch point density. The velocity of fibrinolysis was significantly slower for fibrin formed from FSS2 Challisin-treated fibrinogen but was faster when data was normalised for the increased fibrin density. Thromboelastography of whole blood treated with FSS2 Challisin indicated reduced clot coagulation time and increased shear resistance.

We investigated the influence of coconut water on plasma coagulation in vitro. Either CNW or physiological saline (PS) was added to citrated plasma of 8 healthy volunteers. Coagulation capability of diluted plasma was evaluated by thrombelastography (TEG). Replacement of up to 50 % of citrated plasma by CNW or PS did not influence initiation of coagulation as indicated by split point and reaction time, respectively. Strength of fibrin clot as expressed by maximum amplitude (MA) of TEG recording dose dependently declined in both groups. Replacing 50 % of citrated plasma by CNW or PS reduced MA by 39% and 32%, respectively. The influence of coconut water on hemostasis as assessed by TEG does not differ from the effect caused by an identical volume of PS."

CD010438,0,6291889,0,[Effects of cimetidine and ranitidine on blood coagulation].,"The influence of cimetidine and ranitidine on blood coagulation and plasmatic fibrinolysis were assessed in vitro and in vivo. After an intravenous bolus of 200 mg cimetidine a marked prolongation of plasmatic thrombin time was observed, which however did not occur after 50 mg of ranitidine. In vitro addition of cimetidine (0.12 mg/ml) and ranitidine (0.06 mg/ml) again led to prolongation of plasmatic thrombin time only after cimetidine, reaching double the initial value. This requires application of cimetidine in acute intestinal haemorrhage not as a bolus, but only by drip infusion. Continuous application of 600 mg over 12 hours did not result in changes of coagulation values. In contrast, ranitidine may be administered as a bolus. Bolus injections of 50 to 100 mg did not result in any prolongation of plasmatic thrombin time. The antifibrinolytic effect of both H2-receptor antagonists was investigated in the streptokinase-induced fibrinolysis spindle of the thrombelastogram. Clear-cut antifibrinolytic properties were not demonstrable for either preparation with this method."

Purified fibrinogen was exposed to 0, 25, 50 or 100 μmol/l CORM-2 for 5 min at 37°C and then stored at -80°C before analyses with LC-MS/MS. In a second series of experiments, normal plasma was exposed to 0 or 100 μmol/l CORM-2 in the absence or presence of the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside and hydroquinone (an organic reductant) to compete with carbon monoxide binding to a putative heme group found on fibrinogen. Coagulation was activated with tissue factor (n=8 per condition). Thrombus growth was monitored with thrombelastography for 15 min. LC-MS/MS did not detect any direct modifications of amino acids in fibrinogen, but detection of small regions of both the alpha and gamma chains was lost following exposure to CORM-2 and endoproteinase digestion with trypsin and Glu-C. An ion with the same m/z and expected retention time as heme was found in the purified fibrinogen. Exposure of plasma to nitric oxide/hydroquinone significantly decreased CORM-2-mediated enhancement of coagulation without affecting the coagulation kinetics of plasma not exposed to CORM-2. Carbon monoxide derived from CORM-2 likely modifies fibrinogen via modulation of a fibrinogen-associated heme group(s). Whereas the precise molecular location of heme attachment and three-dimensional conformational change secondary to carbon monoxide exposure remain to be determined, fibrinogen appears to be a carbon monoxide sensing molecule."
CD010438,0,18685432,0,A comparison of kaolin-activated versus nonkaolin-activated thromboelastography in native and citrated blood.,"Thromboelastography can be performed with native or citrated blood (a surrogate to native blood in healthy controls, surgical and cirrhotic patients). Activators such as kaolin are increasingly used to reduce the time to trace generation. To compare kaolin-activated thromboelastography with nonkaolin-activated thromboelastography of native and citrated blood in patients with liver disease, patients undergoing treatment with warfarin or low-molecular weight heparin and healthy volunteers. We studied thromboelastography parameters in 21 healthy volunteers (group 1) and 50 patients, including 20 patients with liver cirrhosis with a nonbiliary aetiology (group 2), 10 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis (group 3), 10 patients on warfarin treatment (group 4) and 10 patients with enoxaparin prophylaxis (group 5). Thromboelastography was performed using four methods: native blood (kaolin-activated and nonkaolin-activated) and citrated blood (kaolin-activated and nonkaolin-activated). For all thromboelastography parameters, correlation was poor (Spearman correlation coefficient < 0.70) between nonkaolin-activated and kaolin-activated thromboelastography, for both citrated and native blood. In healthy volunteers, in patients with liver disease and in those receiving anticoagulant treatment, there was a poor correlation between nonkaolin-activated and kaolin-activated thromboelastography. Kaolin-activated thromboelastography needs further validation before routine clinical use in these settings, and the specific methodology must be considered in comparing published studies."
CD010438,0,2711748,0,"[Various aspects of the interrelations between blood phospholipids, blood coagulation and microcirculation in chronic bronchitis].","Studies of conjunctival microcirculation, thromboelastographic coagulation (as assessed by 8 parameters) and plasma phospholipid spectrum (with 8 fractions obtained), carried out in 136 patients with acute phases of chronic bronchitis, have demonstrated considerable disorders of microcirculation, hypercoagulation and shifts of blood phospholipid spectrum. Marked perivascular disorders were matched by increased levels of plasma lysophosphatidylcholines, which promote increased capillary permeability. Intravascular changes (erythrocyte aggregation and sludging, intermittent flow and stasis of blood) were accompanied by established hypercoagulation and increased phosphatidylethanolamines, producing a coagulating effect. A drop in plasma phosphatidylcholines is a symptom of disrupted synthesis of this phospholipid class in the lungs, and a disorder of pulmonary surfactant structure and function. The level of phosphatidylserins, conducive to histamine release by mast cells, rose in patients with the bronchospastic syndrome. Shifts in other phospholipid fractions, typical for different types and stages of chronic bronchitis, have also been demonstrated. Basically, the magnitude of shifts was greater prior to treatment in the majority of parameters."

Although the system removes 68.4 +/- 14 per cent of the white blood cells from liquid stored blood, the percentage wash out is an unreliable mode of evaluation. The residual number of white blood cells per unit is 6.5 +/- 2.8 x 10(8), which is independent of the unit's size, age, and initial leukocyte count. The residual number of white blood cells is also not influenced by any of the modifications used in the study. Red blood cell loss averaged 16.3 per cent. A direct correlation exists between the initial red blood cell mass and the amount of cell lost. It is recommended that packed cell units which have a volume of less than 300 ml with hematocrits of 75 per cent or less be used to minimize excessive red blood cell loss. Recommendation as to the selection of units by an ideal age or the preparation of units prior to washing are not supported by these data."

CD010438,0,9806670,0,Compromised blood coagulation: an in vitro comparison of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 and hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5 using thrombelastography.,"We compared the effects of progressive in vitro hemodilution (30% and 60%) on blood coagulation in 80 patients receiving one of two different 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions using thrombelastography (TEG). The newly developed solution has a mean molecular weight of 130 kD and a degree of substitution, defined as the average number of hydroxyethyl groups per glucose moiety, of 0.4 (HES 130/0.4); the conventional solution has a mean molecular weight of 200 kD and a degree of substitution of 0.5 (HES 200/0.5). Both HES solutions significantly compromised blood coagulation, as seen by an increase in reaction time and coagulation time and a decrease in angle alpha, maximal amplitude, and coagulation index (all P < 0.05). There was no difference between HES 130/0.4 and HES 200/0.5 diluted blood (P > 0.05 for all TEG variables). When analyzing the intrinsic HES effect by taking hemodilution with 0.9% saline into account, progressive hemodilution with both HES solutions resulted in an increasing clot lysis (P < 0.05 after 60 min). Again, there was no difference between HES 130/0.4 and HES 200/0.5 diluted blood. We conclude that HES 130/ 0.4 and HES 200/0.5 compromise blood coagulation to the same degree."

Blood losses were replaced either with heterologous erythrocyte concentrate (group I), intra- and postoperative autotransfusion of blood salvaged with cellsaver technique (group II) or predonated autologous erythrocyte concentrates together with salvaged blood (group III). Routine and functional coagulation analyses with a Sonoclot were performed preoperatively, 6 hours postoperatively (6 h), day 1-5 and 10. An early postoperative hypo- and late postoperative hypercoagulative phase could be detected with Sonoclot signs of platelet function and fibrin deposition in all groups. Sonoclot coagulation analyses better correlated to both blood loss and dextran dosage than APTT and platelet count in the routine coagulation analyses. Functional coagulation analysis has a potential use in individualizing plasmasubstitution and thromboprophylaxis regimes during autotransfusion in THR."

Unfortunately, thrombotic and bleeding complications are observed despite maintenance of therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) values. We proposed to define the effects of warfarin therapy on thrombus growth and disintegration following contact pathway protein or tissue factor (TF) initiation. Normal subject or patient plasma with INR values between 1.8 and 9.6 were exposed to TF or celite and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Thrombus growth/disintegration kinetics were determined by changes in resistance over time with the clot lifespan model (CSLM), a thrombelastographic-based methodology. Data were collected until clot lysis time was observed. Linear relationships of the difference between the CLSM parameter values obtained from paired celite and TF-activated samples and corresponding INR value were determined and reported as r. The time to clot initiation was progressively prolonged with increasing INR values in all samples, and speed of clot formation, clot strength, and time to onset of fibrinolysis decreased as INR increased. Throughout the range of INR values tested, contact activation resulted in faster growing, stronger, and longer lived thrombi when compared with matched TF-activated plasma samples. Only the time to maximum rate of lysis was correlated with INR (r=0.36, p=0.005). INR values have little correlation with the difference between contact protein and TF-activated coagulation/fibrinolysis."

For this purpose, purified α2-antiplasmin was exposed to 0 or 100 μmol/l CORM-2 for 5 min at 37°C and then placed in α2-antiplasmin-deficient plasma (25 μg/ml α2-antiplasmin and 3.3 μmol/l CORM-2 final concentrations). In a second series of experiments, α2-antiplasmin and deficient plasma were combined and then exposed to 0 or 100 μmol/l CORM-2. Coagulation was activated with tissue factor and fibrinolysis initiated with tissue-type plasminogen activator (n = 8 per condition). Thrombus growth/disintegration kinetics were monitored with thrombelastography until clot lysis time occurred. Samples containing α2-antiplasmin preexposed to 100 μmol/l CORM-2 demonstrated no changes in the velocity of clot growth, but had a significant prolongation of the time to maximum rate of lysis, clot lysis time, and a significant decrease in the maximum rate of clot lysis compared with samples preexposed to 0 μmol/l CORM-2. In sharp contrast, addition of 100 μmol/l CORM-2 to premixed α2-antiplasmin in its deficient plasma resulted in significant, marked increases in the velocity of clot growth and the strength with concurrent antifibrinolytic effects as in the first series. In conclusion, CORM-2 exerts its antifibrinolytic effects by direct enhancement of α2-antiplasmin activity. It appears that combined modification of both fibrinogen and α2-antiplasmin are responsible for the robust procoagulant/antifibrinolytic effects of CORM-2 in the fibrinolytic environment."

CD010438,0,19657316,0,Corn trypsin inhibitor decreases tissue-type plasminogen activator-mediated fibrinolysis of human plasma.,"Corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI) has been considered the molecule of choice to inhibit activated factor XII (FXIIa) during the conduct of experimentation focusing on tissue factor-initiated coagulation. However, CTI-mediated attenuation of fibrinolysis following celite activation of coagulation was observed in pilot studies with the clot lifespan model. The goal of the present study was thus to characterize the mechanism(s) responsible for CTI-mediated hypofibrinolysis. Normal plasma was exposed to 0 or 49.6 microg/ml CTI, with coagulation initiated with celite or tissue factor. Fibrinolysis was initiated with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Additional experiments utilized plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 deficient or alpha2-antiplasmin-deficient plasma. Coagulation/fibrinolysis kinetics were monitored with the thrombelastography-based clot lifespan model. In addition to delaying the initiation of coagulation, CTI prolonged clot growth time, delayed the onset of lysis, and prolonged clot lysis time in normal plasma after celite activation. Conversely, CTI increased the speed of clot growth, clot strength, and prolonged clot lysis time after tissue factor activation. Experiments with plasma deficient in antifibrinolytic proteins supported a primary inhibition of tPA by CTI. In addition to anti-FXIIa effects following celite activation, CTI likely exerts an anti-tPA effect, which contributed to hypofibrinolysis in this model."

Blood was taken from an existing central line at baseline (37 degrees C), during warming (39 and 41 degrees C) and cooling (39 and 37 degrees C). Sonoclot and TEG samples were analysed simultaneously at 37 degrees C and at the patient's temperature with a temperature-compensated unit, except at 41 degrees C for the Sonoclot (maximum temperature adjustment of 40 degrees C). TEG measurements included R time (time to initial fibrin formation [mm]), K time (mm) and alpha angle (degrees) (both reflecting fibrinogen-platelet interaction), maximum amplitude (representing qualitative platelet function [mm]) and per cent fibrinolysis at 30 and 60 min. The Sonoclot ACT (SonACT-secs), initial rate of clot formation (%), time to peak amplitude (min) and peak amplitude of the Sonoclot signature (mm) were recorded. Decreased R time of the TEG compared to a marginally elevated baseline was found at all times during warming and cooling (p < 0.05). The K time was decreased at 41 degrees C compared to a normal baseline (p < 0.05). The SonACT was decreased (from an elevated baseline) at all other times, without differences in measures at patient temperature versus 37 degrees C (p < 0.05). The data suggest acceleration of fibrin formation during WBH to 41 degrees C in patients with malignancy. Implications for defining thromboembolic risk require further investigation."

CD010438,0,21655681,1,Platelet function following trauma. A multiple electrode aggregometry study.,"Platelets play a central role in coagulation. Currently, information on platelet function following trauma is limited. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the emergency room (ER) at the AUVA Trauma Centre, Salzburg, after sustaining traumatic injury. Immediately after admission to the ER, blood was drawn for blood cell counts, standard coagulation tests, and platelet function testing. Platelet function was assessed by multiplate electrode aggregometry (MEA) using adenosine diphosphate (ADPtest), collagen (COLtest) and thrombin receptor activating peptide-6 (TRAPtest) as activators. The thromboelastometric platelet component, measuring the contribution of platelets to the elasticity of the whole-blood clot, was assessed using the ROTEM device. The study included 163 patients, 79.7% were male, and the median age was 43 years. The median injury severity score was 18. Twenty patients (12.3%) died. Median platelet count was significantly lower among non-survivors than survivors (181,000/μl vs. 212,000/μl; p=0.01). Although platelet function defects were relatively minor, significant differences between survivors and non-survivors were observed in the ADPtest (94 vs. 79 U; p=0.0019), TRAPtest (136 vs. 115 U; p<0.0001), and platelet component (134 vs.103 MCEEXTEM - MCEFIBTEM; p=0.0012). Aggregometry values below the normal range for ADPtest and TRAPtest were significantly more frequent in non-survivors than in survivors (p=0.0017 and p=0.0002, respectively). Minor decreases in platelet function upon admission to the ER were a sign of coagulopathy accompanying increased mortality in patients with trauma. Further studies are warranted to confirm these results and investigate the role of platelet function in trauma haemostatic management."

Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is a basic polypeptide stored in platelets that reverses heparin. To investigate its potential as a reversal drug, we studied recombinant PF4 on anticoagulated blood obtained during cardiac surgery. Blood was obtained from 33 different venous reservoirs, and activated clotting time (ACT), heparin concentrations, and heparinase-ACT were determined. Anticoagulation was reversed by adding incremental PF4:heparin and protamine:heparin ratios to the heparinized blood, and the ACTs were determined (n = 21). Viscoelastic analysis of anticoagulation reversal was performed by adding protamine or PF4 at reversal ratios of 1.3:1 protamine:heparin, and 3.2:1 PF4:heparin using thromboelastography (n = 12). PF4 reversal ratios of 3:1 and 3.5:1 and protamine reversal ratios of 1:1, 1.5:1, 2:1 were not statistically different from heparinase-ACT values. There were no significant differences in viscoelastic measurements of clot formation between protamine and PF4. Recombinant PF4 at a 3.0:1 ratio reverses heparin-induced anticoagulation after cardiopulmonary bypass, and represents a potential alternative, especially for the protamine allergic patient."

The prevalence and geometric mean (GM) intensity of infection before the implementation of curative chemotherapy were 28.5% and 234.4 epg, respectively, but 9 months after treatment the prevalence (6.6%) and intensity (38.3 epg) had decreased. There was no significant difference in either the prevalence or intensity of infection between males and females. Specific IgG (total), IgG4, IgG2, IgA and IgE responses to AWA, PMY and TEG were measured by ELISA. Males produced significantly (P < 0.05) more anti-AWA total IgG, IgE, IgA, IgG4 and IgG2 antibodies, and anti-TEG IgG2 antibody than their female counterparts. The OD450 levels of anti-AWA, PMY and TEG antibody isotypes did not present clear age-dependent trends except for peak levels of anti-AWA IgG4 antibodies evident among subjects 20-29 years of age. The total IgG and IgG4 antibody profiles against AWA correlated well with current S. japonicum infections while anti-AWA IgG2, IgA and IgE antibodies did not show such an association. Anti-AWA-specific IgE antibody levels were positively correlated (r = 0.55) with anti-AWA specific IgG4 antibody levels. In addition, the overall percentage of responders (using a cut-off value obtained from normal controls) to all isotypes to AWA were higher than those observed for both the recombinant antigens. Only 18.2%, 16.8% and 7.3% of the study population were IgE responders to AWA, PMY and TEG.

CD010438,0,413223,0,"Partial plasma exchange, and adjunct in therapy to complex clinical problems.","The use of therapeutic partial plasma exchange (PPE) is reviewed as an adjunct in the treatment of certain complex clinical problems. The procedure is performed with a Model 30 Haemonetics Blood Cell Separator in which the patient's plasma is partially exchanged with fresh frozen plasma, fresh frozen plasma with cryoprecipitate removed or with plasma protein fraction. The present study describes the use of PPE on 12 patients within the last 15 months as a means of altering the plasma proteins to achieve certain therapeutic goals. The study consists of six procoagulant deficient patients (five congentital and one acquired) in which five of the six patients responded by reflecting a satisfactory rise in the plasma procoagulant level following the procedure, resulting in cessation of bleeding. The sixth patient was thought to have had a procoagulant inhibitor, thus the procoagulant level was changed only minimally. The remaining six patients (five with hyperviscosity syndrome and one with platelet antibody) responded only to the degree of the intensiveness of the PPE procedure. More aggressvie, repeated PPE and/or plasmapheresis are needed if the clinical objective is to decrease the plasma viscosity or to lower a humoral antibody within the patient's plasma."
CD010438,0,3739330,0,Plasmapheresis technology.,"Manual plasmapheresis is done worldwide on both paid donors, and to a much smaller extent on volunteer donors in order to generate source plasma to be fractionated into albumin, clotting factor concentrates, and gamma globulin. Automated technology has now been developed utilizing both centrifugal, and membrane separation devices (Haemonetics PCS centrifugal, Organon Teknika PLASMAPUR-membrane, HemaScience Autopheresis-C-spinning membrane) and is much faster and safer than the manual techniques with regard to the donor. The single biggest difficulty with automated technology is the high cost of the software, making the cost of producing source plasma by this type of technology, in general, not cost efficient at this time. However, fresh frozen plasma can be generated by this technology, which is cost efficient and provides a single donor source of 500 ml plasma, making the product safer for those patients that do require fresh frozen plasma by reducing the number of donor exposures to the patient."
CD010438,0,15334755,0,Plateletworks platelet function test compared to the thromboelastograph for prediction of postoperative outcomes.,"Approximately 3.5 million units of platelets are transfused in the United States each year to patients undergoing open-heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). CPB is a known contributor to platelet loss and platelet dysfunction leading to disruption of hemostasis. Impaired hemostasis results in excess bleeding in 5-25% of all patients undergoing CPB. For this reason, it may be beneficial to measure platelet number and function in these patients. The purpose of this study was to compare the Plateletworks platelet function analyzer to the thromboelastograph (TEG) in predicting postoperatiave hemostatic outcomes as measured by blood product use and chest tube (CT) drainage. This study consisted of 35 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at Rush-Presbyterian-Saint Luke's Medical Center (RPSLMC). The Plateletworks and TEG tests were performed preoperatively, after protamine was given, and 24 hours postoperatively on all patients. Plateletworks demonstrated a statistically significant change in platelet function as shown by the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) reagent tube from the preoperative period to the removal of the aortic cross clamp (p = .011). The TEG did not demonstrate a significant change in the k-time and maximum amplitude (MA), but did show a significant change in the alpha-angle from the pre-operative to postoperatiave sample (p = .035). A correlation was found between Plateletworks collagen reagent tubes preoperatively and CT drainage (p = .048, r -0.324). No statistical correlation was established between TEG parameters and CT drainage at any time interval. TEG preoperative MA showed a correlation to receipt of blood products (p = .016). When comparing the Plateletworks to the TEG in this study, the Plateletworks system was a more useful predictor of blood product use and chest tube drainage."

A function assay that evaluates platelet reactivity and inhibition by drug therapy is beneficial for such patients. Platelet Mapping assay (PM) using the TEG analyzer was tested in surgical patients. After IRB approval, 60 patients on combined aspirin and clopidogrel therapy were consented and enrolled. The TEG maximal amplitude (MA) and the percentage (%) platelet inhibition were recorded and analyzed. Fifty-seven patients (mean age 65.7 ± 10.9 years) had preoperative data only. Distribution of preoperative ADP (43.6 ± 24.4%) and AA inhibition (52.8 ± 30.2%) was determined, as well as for the preoperative MA ADP (43.1 ± 15.9 mm) and MA AA (37.2 ± 19.6 mm), showing an offset of the effect of both medications starting from day 3. Patients with complete pre- and postoperative data were stratified depending on duration off antiplatelet therapy (≤3 days, 3-7 days and >7 days): n = 27, ADP % preop inhibition (43.2 ± 21.6%), ADP % postop inhibition (32.3 ± 18.3%), p = 0.048. Distribution of immediate pre- and post- ADP and AA % inhibitions, showing a possible reduction in Δ of inhibition for clopidogrel at 3 days, were also assessed."

CD010438,0,19572078,0,Prophylactic fibrinogen infusion reduces bleeding after coronary artery bypass surgery. A prospective randomised pilot study.,"It has been suggested that preoperative fibrinogen plasma concentration is independently associated to postoperative blood loss after cardiac surgery. Theoretically, prophylactic infusion of fibrinogen concentrate may thus reduce postoperative bleeding, but this has not previously been investigated. Twenty elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients with preoperative plasma fibrinogen levels <3.8 g/l were included in a prospective randomised pilot study. Patients were randomised to receive an infusion of 2 g fibrinogen concentrate (FIB group) or no infusion before surgery (control group). Primary endpoint was safety with clinical adverse events and graft occlusion assessed by multi-slice computed tomography. Predefined secondary endpoints were postoperative blood loss, blood transfusions, haemoglobin levels 24 hours (h) after surgery, and global haemostasis assessed with thromboelastometry, 2 and 24 hours after surgery. Infusion of 2 g fibrinogen concentrate increased plasma levels of fibrinogen by 0.6 +/- 0.2 g/l. There were no clinically detectable adverse events of fibrinogen infusion. Computed tomography revealed one subclinical vein graft occlusion in the FIB group. Fibrinogen concentrate infusion reduced postoperative blood loss by 32% (565 +/- 150 vs. 830 +/- 268 ml/12 h, p=0.010). Haemoglobin concentration was significantly higher 24 h after surgery in the FIB group (110 +/- 12 vs. 98 +/- 8 g/l, p=0.018). Prophylactic fibrinogen concentrate infusion did not influence global postoperative haemostasis as assessed by thromboelastometry. In conclusion, in this pilot study preoperative fibrinogen concentrate infusion reduced bleeding after CABG without evidence of postoperative hypercoagulability. Larger studies are necessary to ensure safety and confirm efficacy of prophylactic fibrinogen treatment in cardiac surgery."

Significant changes of hypercoagulability (low AT-III and abnormal TEG) were seen in the third-trimester bleeder and premature labor groups which also had the highest incidence of IRDS and necrotizing. Infants undergoing ""stress"" (pre-eclampsia, fetal distress) had elevated levels of factors V and VIII but were not hypercoagulable or AT-III deficient. Except for mild thrombocytopenia, infants of the diabetic mothers, a group with increased thrombotic complications, did not show any cord blood abnormalities. Offspring of third-trimester bleeders were anemic. The EBF infants were also anemic, severely hypercoagulable, and showed coagulation changes compatible with severe liver disease and/or DIC. Mild changes compatible with intravascular coagulation were seen in six infants and were not related to the the development of IRDS."

CD010438,0,19302233,0,Can Thromboelastography performed on kaolin-activated citrated samples from critically ill patients provide stable and consistent parameters?,"Thromboelastography (TEG) is a potentially useful tool but analysis within 4-6 min of collection imposes limitations on its use and access. The use of citrate blood tubes potentially increases the time frame for processing specimens. There is, however, limited research on the stability of citrate specimens, timing of processing and the accuracy of TEG results. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of early and delayed processing on TEG parameters using kaolin-activated citrated blood samples in the intensive care population. TEG analysis was performed on 61 patients. Blood was collected into two 3.2% sodium citrate (0.105 m) tubes. Kaolin-activated samples were analysed at 15, 30 and 120 min postcollection. TEG parameters analysed included reaction time (R), clot formation time (K), alpha angle (alpha), maximum amplitude, LY30, the coagulation index, time to maximum rate of thrombus generation, maximum rate of thrombus generation and total thrombus generation. Sixty-one critically ill patients were included. The results of the anova showed that time from collection was significantly associated with the TEG((R)) results (P < 0.05). On comparison of individual outcome variables, this difference in most cases was due to changes over time from 30 to 120 min. Furthermore, progressive changes in TEG parameters such as decreasing R were suggestive of a trend toward hypercoagulability of the specimens. Processing of kaolin-activated citrate TEG specimens can begin as early as 15 min postvenipuncture. However, delaying processing by more than 30 min leads to a significant change in results."
CD010438,0,8747687,0,Thromboelastography and liver transplantation.,"TEG has played an integral part in the growth of liver transplantation. The group at the University of Pittsburgh early on realized that coagulation dysfunction during liver transplantation would be both severe and dynamic. Each phase of the operation appears to have both predictable and unexpected changes in clot dynamics. The routine coagulation profile, although of great use, does not provide an overview of the interaction of stimulators, inhibitors, and available procoagulants to effect a final process, the production of a solid clot. The TEG is a unique gross test of clot strength perfectly suited to the changes during liver transplantation. The initial pioneering work during liver transplantation has inspired the work of others in related surgical fields to explore its utility. There is little doubt that its full utility has not yet been realized. Many questions still remain with regard to liver transplantation. New medications such as aprotinin will be applied to this procedure over the next few years. What effect these new medications will have on hemorrhage or thrombosis of vascular anastomoses is yet to be adequately explored. A new awareness appears to be arriving that normal or excessively hypercoagulable states could contribute to such thromboses. TEG as a technology will certainly contribute to a number of future studies and clinical care, which will enhance the conduct of liver transplantation in the future."

Three previous such mass poisonings implicated Chinese manufacturers as the origin of contaminated ingredients. No literature exists on potential DEG or triethylene glycol (TEG), a related compound, contamination of health products imported from Asian countries to the USA. Our primary objective was to quantitatively assess the amount of DEG present in a convenience sampling of these health products. The study's secondary objectives were to: (1) evaluate for, and quantify TEG levels in these samples; (2) compare DEG and TEG levels in these products directly to levels in medications implicated in previous similar mass poisonings; and (3) to estimate DEG dose (in mg/kg) based on the manufacturer's instructions and compare these values to toxic doses from past mass poisonings and the literature. A quantitative assessment of DEG and TEG was performed in a convenience sampling of over-the-counter health products imported from Asian countries. Results were converted to volume to volume (v/v) % and compared with DEG levels in medications implicated in previous mass poisonings. Estimated doses (based on the manufacturer's instructions) of each product with detectable levels of DEG for a 70 kg adult were compared to toxic doses of DEG reported in the literature. Seventeen of 85 (20%) samples were not able to be analyzed for DEG or TEG due to technical reasons. Fifteen of 68 (22%) samples successfully tested had detectable levels of DEG (mean, 18.8 μg/ml; range, 0.791-110.1 μg/ml; and volume to volume (v/v) range, 0.00007-0.01%). Two of 68 (3%) samples had TEG levels of 12.8 and 20.2 μg/ml or 0.0012% and 0.0018% TEG v/v. The product with the highest DEG% by v/v was 810 times less than the product involved in the Panama DEG mass poisoning (8.1%). The lowest reported toxic dose from a past DEG mass poisoning (14 mg/kg) was more than 150 times higher than the highest daily dose estimated in our study (0.09 mg/kg). Sixty-eight of 85 (80%) samples were able to be successfully analyzed for DEG and TEG. DEG and TEG were detectable in 15/68 (22%) and 2/68 (3%) samples, respectively. Based on current standards, these levels probably do not represent an acute public health threat. Additional research focusing on why DEG is found in these products and on the minimum amount of DEG needed to result in toxicity is needed."

Analysis of sequential 5-ml aliquots of the mononuclear cell concentrate revealed that both immunocompetent cells and granulocytic progenitor cells (CFU-C) were proportional to the cell count throughout the buffy coat. In vitro pheresis of large volumes of human bone marrow resulted in recovery of 63% of the cells, 12% of the hemoglobin, and 84% of the CFU-C in 20% of the original volume. Further centrifugation eliminated 80% of the platelets without loss of cells or CFU-C. SCFC of peripheral blood or bone marrow selectively concentrated mononuclear cells and reduced the contamination by granulocytes and erythrocytes. Large numbers of mononuclear cells can thus be collected for studies in vitro or for cryopreservation and the autologous reconstitution of immunosuppressed or myelosuppressed patients undergoing intensive antitumor therapy."

Several investigations have revealed that various components are segregated from different composite filling materials into an aqueous environment after polymerization. Most organic substances can be extracted from a set resin by organic solvents (methanol, tetrahydrofuran, ethanol). Furthermore, in most studies, the co-monomer TEG-DMA has been identified as the main compound released from polymerized resin composites into aqueous media. However, small quantities of the monomers (Bis-GMA, UDMA) and other co-monomers, as well as additives, may also be released into water. Very little data have been published about substances released from various types of glass ionomer cements (GIC), except the liberation of fluoride. Erosion studies have revealed that there is a considerable disintegration of GICs at lower pH-values. However, the nature of the eroded substances has not yet been clarified. Altogether, the data presented in this review indicate that information is comparably scarce for resin composites and GICs in comparison to the rich amount of knowledge concerning amalgams. Therefore, further studies are necessary to determine quality and quantity of substances segregated from resin composites and GICs."

Two biomedical tests were then used to study the biocompatibility properties of these nanocapsules with different surface treatments, hemolysis and thromboelastography (TEG). PEO surface modification greatly reduced the damaging interactions of nanocapsules with red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets and attenuated particle size effects. It was found that the blood toxicity of charged particles increased with the acid strength on the surface.

Recognition of potential ethnic differences in coagulation profiles would be important to a microvascular surgeon. Based on clinical observations, we hypothesize that Asian patients have a less thrombogenic coagulation profile than Caucasians. An extensive retrospective review was performed. The annual incidence of venous thromboembolism in the United States is generally accepted to range from 70 to 120 events per 100,000 people versus 16 to 17 events per 100,000 persons in Asia. Autopsy analysis of pulmonary embolism incidence was noted to be 15% in North Americans and less than 1% in Asian populations. Thromboelastography analysis of Asian and Caucasian patients undergoing cholecystectomy revealed different hemostatic mechanisms. Comparison of Asians and Caucasians undergoing the Fontan procedure revealed significantly lower postoperative factor levels in Asians than Caucasians. Baseline comparison of factor and serum levels revealed Asians with the least thrombogenic profiles compared with other ethnic groups. Asians and Caucasians demonstrate different baseline rates of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, different hemostatic responses to surgery, and different baseline levels of clotting factors. Further study may lead to better pre-, intra-, and postoperative care of the free flap patient based on their ethnic coagulation profile."
CD010438,0,22221846,0,Fibrinogen concentrate in the treatment of severe bleeding after aortic aneurysm graft surgery.,"Aortic aneurysm graft surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass is often associated with substantial coagulopathic perioperative bleeding, requiring hemostatic intervention with allogeneic blood products, such as fresh frozen plasma, platelet concentrate, and red blood cells. We conducted a pilot study to determine the effects of fibrinogen concentrate in patients with microvascular bleeding during aortic valve surgery with ascending aorta replacement. Dosing of fibrinogen concentrate was individualized based on thromboelastometry. First-line therapy with fibrinogen concentrate reduced the need for allogeneic blood product support, including transfusions of fresh frozen plasma, platelet concentrate, and red blood cells. Similar results were seen in a second cohort study conducted in patients undergoing thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery: patients who received fibrinogen concentrate required significantly less allogeneic blood product support following surgery. These results prompted the initiation of a randomized placebo-controlled trial in patients undergoing thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery, aortic valve surgery with ascending aorta replacement, or aortic arch surgery. Results are expected to be published soon. Larger, multicenter studies are needed to determine the exact role of fibrinogen concentrate in the management of perioperative bleeding following cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass."
CD010438,0,17568492,0,An approach to transfusion and hemorrhage in trauma: current perspectives on restrictive transfusion strategies.,"Hemorrhagic shock is a leading cause of death in trauma patients. Surgical control of bleeding and fluid resuscitation with both crystalloid and blood products remain the mainstay of therapy for injured patients with bleeding. However, there has been a recent re-evaluation of transfusion practice. Both the fear of transmissible disease and the costs of transfusing blood products have led to increasingly restrictive transfusion practices. A small percentage of trauma patients require massive transfusion. These patients are complex and difficult to manage, and clinicians must act quickly to save them. There is little evidence to help guide clinical transfusion decisions in these patients. A rational approach to using blood products requires an understanding of the end points of resuscitation. Resuscitation with fluids and red cells is necessary to improve perfusion and oxygen delivery to tissues. Avoiding overtransfusion is key, however, because transfusion is also associated with significant risks. This trend toward reducing allogenic blood exposure will likely continue. New technologies that have the potential of reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements in trauma patients with massive bleeding are being developed, and similar old technologies are being reapplied."

The patients were found to have signs of erythrocyte edema, their more rapid depletion, lower resistance and higher aggregation which was accompanied by increased hematocrit and normal erythrocyte count. The thromboelastograms showed that all all phases of blood coagulation were shortened and fibrinolysis was deeply depressed. There was an increase in activated partial thromboplastin and thrombin time, a reduction in the values of the prothrombin indices and antithrombin III activity and higher heparin levels. The fibrinogen level was either normal or reduced despite an increase in other acute phase reactants, followed by the appearance of large amounts of blocked fibrinogen in the blood. Analysis of the findings enabled one to regard a combination of the above changes as signs of the latent DIC syndrome. Determination of fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products in a deep and long-term inhibition of fibrinolysis loses its diagnostic significance."

However, the disadvantages of DFO surround its high toxicity and very short plasma half-life. Here, the detailed in vitro evaluation of a novel class of high molecular weight iron chelators based on DFO and polyethylene glycol methacrylate is reported. Reversible addition fragment chain transfer (RAFT) copolymerization afforded polymer conjugates (P-DFO) with well-controlled molecular weight (27-127 kDa) and substitution of DFO (5-26 units per chain) along the copolymer. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) based cell viability assays showed that the cytotoxicity of P-DFO decreased more than 100-fold at identical concentrations of DFO. The hemocompatibilities of various P-DFO samples were determined by measuring prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombelastograph parameters (TEG), complement activation, platelet activation, and red blood cell aggregation. Furthermore, the iron binding properties and chelating efficiency of P-DFO were compared to DFO by measuring the spectral properties upon binding to iron(III), while the prevention of iron(III) mediated oxidation of hemoglobin was also determined. Degradation of the P-DFO conjugates via cleavable ester linkages between the polymer backbone and the PEG side chains was evaluated using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and NMR. Since the chelating ability of DFO remains intact after conjugation to the copolymer backbone, these macromolecular, blood compatible and degradable conjugates are promising candidates as long circulating, non-toxic iron chelators."

CD010438,0,1027924,0,[Changes in thromboelastogram in women on hormonal contraception].,"The authors have analysed changes in the thromboelastogram in 411 women on oral contraceptives and in 31 women on no hormonal contraception. Comparing the results they found no statistically significant differences because the control group was too small. In the group of women on hormonal contraception, statistically significant differences were recorded in those women whose thromboelastogram was analysed several times, the differences having been more pronounced in the women that had used hormonal contraceptives for a longer time. As the appearance of thrombo-embolic complications is a very complex process, the authors' opinion is that thromboelastogram cannot be considered as a routine method for predicting these complications."

This phase 1 escalating-dose study was developed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single administration of human recombinant FXIII-A2 (rFXIII-A2) homodimer in adults with congenital FXIII deficiency. Pharmacokinetics and activity of rXIII and changes in endogenous B subunit levels were assessed. Recombinant FXIII-A2 homodimer were complexed with endogenous FXIII-B subunits to form an FXIII-A2B2 heterotetramer with a half-life of 8.5 days, similar to that of endogenous FXIII. The median dose response was a 2.4% increase in FXIII activity based on unit per kilogram rFXIII administered. After the administration of rFXIII-A2, clot solubility normalized as measured by clot lysis in urea. Clot strength and resistance to fibrinolysis, as assessed by thromboelastography, also improved. Safety reviews were conducted before each dose escalation; no serious adverse events, including bleeding or thrombosis, were noted during the study. In addition, there was no evidence of the generation of specific antibodies to rFXIII or yeast proteins. Recombinant FXIII appears to be a safe and potentially effective alternative for FXIII replacement in patients with FXIII deficiency."

The parameters mentioned in some studies are also presented in the introduction. There are still few studies by means of which it can be enlightened what happens in the human body affected by atmospheric disturbances. Therefore the basic intention of this study was to come up with answers to at least some segments of this complex problem. A group of patients with cerebrovascular symptoms and signs was chosen for examination. Tests were carried out during cold and warm front passages in anticyclonal situations and low gradient pressure fields within 47 days. In the first stage the tests were carried out only in one day and later for three consecutive days. Meteorological reports are given too. As for medical parameters, the following were controlled: the neurology status, blood pressure, blood test, ECG, REG. The coagulum was regularly checked. The examination was carried out in 12 male and 14 female patients, the age range 43-78. On the basis of the tests, the authors concluded that the most significant changes were noticed in the coagulum and thromboelastogram. According to the results, these changes are manifested during the cold front and during the cold spell caused by it. The findings point to a significant increasing of the thrombocyte aggregation and partly the aggregation index, which can be clinically manifested as the patient's health aggravation. Although other parameters of coagulation did not show significant changes, it cannot be deduced whether they are susceptible to the circumstances in the atmosphere or not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The positive postoperative results of elective treatment account for a lowered mortality rate, with life expectancy prolonged as much as twice. However, the results of the operative treatment of AAA on an emergency basis are still unsatisfactory. It is the purpose of this paper to describe hitherto experience and success of the clinic with AAA treatment, and inform the medical circles about the increased potentialities of the management of this unexplored, difficult but still curable disease. Seventy-three patients presenting AAA, operated on during the period 1989-1993, are analyzed. The clinical signs and associated diseases, frequency of clinical forms, preoperative factors influencing the risks of forthcoming operations and the long-term results are comprehensively discussed. An asymptomatic clinical form is observed in 60.5 per cent of the patients (Pt = 0.05). Operative lethality is significantly increased in the event of rupture of the aneurysm, its diameter, angina pectoris symptoms and hypertension (P = 0.01). A standard operative technique, described by Creech, is used. Haemonetics Cell Saver is also employed. Thus, the amount of donor blood is reduced by one third of the volume required without any accidents or fatalities. The causes of postoperative death include: ischemic colitis, myocardial infarction and bronchopneumonia. Thanks to the experience and skill of the surgical and anesthesiological teams, the last five years are marked by a low rate of mortality - 3.7 percent for the elective group, and 12.5 percent for the emergency cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We tested the hypothesis that tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer (CORM-2) improves the velocity of formation and strength of hemophiliac plasma thrombi as determined by thrombelastography. Plasma deficient (<1% normal activity) in factor VIII (FVIII; n = 11 individuals), factor IX (FIX; n = 5 individuals) or factor VII (FVII; n = 4 individuals) was exposed to 0 or 100 micromol CORM-2, with coagulation initiated with tissue factor. Coagulation kinetics were monitored with thrombelastography for 15 min. Paired t-tests were used to analyze FVIII-deficient plasma results; relative change was used to describe the other plasma types tested. In FVIII-deficient plasma, CORM-2 exposure significantly (P < 0.05) increased the velocity of thrombus formation (84%) and strength (48%) compared with plasma not exposed to CORM-2. FXI-deficient clots demonstrated an increase in velocity of formation (63%) and strength (43%) after CORM-2 exposure. Lastly, CORM-2 exposure increased FVII-deficient plasma velocity of formation (45%) and strength (63%). CORM-2 markedly enhanced the velocity of clot growth and strength in hemophiliac plasma. These findings serve as the rationale to determine whether CORMs could be utilized as hemostatic agents."

Recently, a new generation of implantable continuous flow axial pumps was introduced into clinical application. To study the potential thrombogenic properties of this type of pump, we applied extensive platelet monitoring was applied. In our institution, 13 patients received the MicroMed DeBakey VAD as a bridge to transplantation. Routine coagulation tests (platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, antithrombin III activity) and platelet function tests (whole blood aggregometry, thrombelastography, flow cytometry) were performed. No clinically relevant thromboembolic events were detected. No correlation was found between global function tests, platelet aggregation, and thrombelastography. No correlation was detected between platelet activation and hemolysis parameters. Platelet aggregation and coagulation index were significantly suppressed early after operation. A subsequent phase of hyper-aggregability, starting around day 6, suggested the initiation of antiaggregation therapy. Platelet activation markers were upregulated in the postoperative period but were returned to preoperative levels after initiation of aspirin. In contrast to routine coagulation monitoring, platelet function tests reflect in detail the coagulation status of blood pump recipients and the efficiency of antiaggregation therapy. Aspirin and dipyridamole therapy in addition to oral anticoagulation using phenprocoumon may contribute to platelet function and clot mechanics restoration and is, therefore, recommended for patients after VAD implantation."

The review was based on a Medline search for articles with key words related to ""platelet function tests"", ""point-of-care"", and ""anaesthesia"", published in English between January 1996 and September 2008. It was found that global assessments of 'haemostasis', such as the standard thrombelastograph, Sonoclot, Clot Signature Analyser and Hemodyne, are not specific for platelet function and are essentially insensitive to cyclooxygenase inhibitors (aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and P2Y12 antagonists (ticlopidine, clopidogrel). Global assessments of 'platelet function', such as the PFA-100 and PlateletWorks, are more specific for platelet function, but also have limited sensitivity for cyclooxygenase inhibitors and P2Y12 antagonists. The newer devices developed specifically for the assessment of antiplatelet drugs, such as Platelet Mapping, the Impact Cone and Platelet Analyser and the VerifyNow, are more promising, but are not as sensitive as laboratory platelet aggregometry. All three categories of devices detect G(p)II(b)/III(a) antagonists (abciximab, tirofiban, eptifibatide) activity, but not all provide quantitative assessments for monitoring therapy. The limitations appeared to be related to the complexity of platelet function, the multiple pathways of platelet activation, the wide interpatient variability in platelet responses and the interdependence between platelets and other aspects of coagulation. The strengths and limitations of point-of-care devices should be appreciated before they are used to assist clinical decision-making in the perioperative period."

A 21-year-old Hispanic woman with afibrinogenemia developed ascites, a distended abdomen, an enlarged liver, scleral icterus, and umbilical vein and abdominal wall vein distension. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed occlusion of the hepatic veins and the infrahepatic vena cava consistent with Budd-Chiari syndrome. These developments led to her evaluation for, and placement on, the liver transplantation waiting list. The patient's unmeasurable international normalized ratio (INR) artifactually increased her Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score to 40. Immediately before transplant surgery, an initial thrombelastogram (TEG) showed a flat line, indicating a complete lack of fibrin clot formation. Preoperatively, 20 units of cryoprecipitate were infused. The first intraoperative TEG demonstrated a tracing consistent with normal clot formation. Coagulation studies normalized with the newly functioning liver. The liver transplantation appears to have corrected the fibrinogen deficiency, presumably limiting the chance of recurrent Budd-Chiari syndrome. This case report discusses the essential role of fibrinogen in the coagulation cascade, as visualized by thrombelastography, and exposes the interplay between plasma fibrinogen and thrombin levels, which determine coagulation or fibrinolysis."

However, this latter effect may be less conspicuous with low molecular weight (LMW) solutions than with high molecular weight (HMW) solutions. Therefore, LMW- and HMW-HES solutions were evaluated as priming solutions for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with respect to their effect on haemostasis. Forty-five patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting were prospectively randomised to three groups and received in a double-blind manner as their CPB prime either 20 ml.kg-1 LMW-HES (Mw 120,000), 20 ml.kg-1 HMW-HES (Mw 400,000) or Ringer's acetate 2000 ml. The final volume of the prime was completed to 2000 ml with Ringer's acetate in the HES groups. Anaesthesia and CPB management were standardised. Plasma levels of von Willebrand factor antigen and factor VIII procoagulant activity were significantly more depressed after CPB in both HES-groups as compared with the crystalloid prime group. In addition, APTT was more prolonged and the maximal amplitude of thromboelastographic tracing was more decreased in the HES-groups. It is concluded that it may be advisable to avoid HES solutions in the CPB prime, especially in patients with an increased risk for bleeding after cardiac operations."

Three of the patients had recurrent attacks of transient global amnesia, and another three had a stroke, although at some distance from the amnesia attack. Association was noted with certain risk factors including high blood pressure, and angiopathic changes of the eye fundus (in 50% of the patients), dyslipidemia (in 30%), diabetes (in 10%), and essential polyglobulia (in 7%). Coagulation studies including thrombelastograms were carried out in 22 patients, and demonstrated hypercoagulability in 50% of them. Changes in the arterial wall were noted in 85% of the 14 patients in whom carotid sphygmograms were recorded. The presence of these risk factors could explain the occurrence of cerebrovascular accidents in patients with transient global amnesia. Electroencephalograms performed immediately or a short time after the amnesia attack have evidenced in 18 patients rapid-type dysrhythmia, or diffuse theta waves, predominantly located in the deep layers of the left and right temporal areas. The EEG tracings were either flat or normal in the remaining 12 patients. Of the 30 patients presenting with global transient amnesia only two had migraine in antecedents, and another six had headache during the evolution of amnesia.

Microdialysis studies have revealed that lactate levels are very high inside contusions, corresponding to significant acidosis. The current study was performed in an effort to investigate whether the lactate accumulation inside cerebral contusions may be a contributing factor to the prolonged bleeding inside contusions. We have investigated the effects of lactic acidosis on the coagulation system with rotational thromboelastometry. It was a laboratory study involving 6 healthy volunteers. Blood was drawn and the pH was adjusted by addition of lactic acid in vitro. The pH levels studied were 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, and 6.8. The pH was also readjusted to 7.4 by addition the buffer THAM to blood initially adjusted to a pH of 6.8 to study the reversibility of potential adverse effects induced by the lactic acidosis. We found the coagulation to be significantly impaired by lactic acidosis (P = 0.000l). The impairment found was reversible after correction of the acidosis by a buffer. In conclusion, we found that lactic acidosis impaired the coagulation system. The impairment caused by lactic acidosis may be one factor causing the progressive hemorrhage in posttraumatic cerebral contusions, known to have high levels of lactate and correspondingly low pH. It may also be important to consider in bleeding trauma patients."

The flow rate was selected for a range of 40-70 ml/min and the centrifuge speed was established at 4,800 and 4,400 rpm. The PWC factor was chosen between 0 and 4. 162 procedures could be statistically evaluated. 34 apheresis were accompanied with technical complications. The mean yield was (4.3 +/- 1.05) x 10(11) platelets, and the average of extraction efficiency (EE) was 53.9 +/- 8.2%. An analysis of variance confirmed that a higher flow rate decreased the EE (p < 0.002) and also the leukocyte counts (p < 0.0005). Increasing the PWC factor led to a higher EE; however, the leukocyte counts of the platelet concentrate were also increased (p < 0.0005). The g force has an essential effect. A high g force of the centrifuge permits to obtain a large quantity of platelets which is combined with a higher leukocyte contamination. Decreasing the centrifuge speed to 4,400 rpm by using PWC factors of 0 and 4 with different flow rates (50 and 60 ml/min) decreased the EE and the leukocyte counts in the product."

This review discusses another coagulation model system--the clot lifespan model (CLSM)--that has been designed to compliment the CBM-based approach to elucidating the mechanisms responsible for a variety of hemostatic disorders/phenomena. The CLSM is a thrombelastograph-based approach that utilizes a standardized clotting stimulus (e.g., celite, tissue factor) and a fibrinolytic stimulus (e.g., tissue type plasminogen activator) to assess clot growth and disintegration via changes in clot resistance. The CLSM utilizes parametric, elastic modulus-based parameters to document these phenomena. The CLSM has recently been employed to discern the effects of protamine and hydroxyethyl starch on key fibrinolytic-antifibrinolytic protein interactions, as well as demonstrating differences in fibrinolytic kinetics dependent on whether contact pathway proteins or tissue factor is used to initiate coagulation. The CLSM is presently being utilized to investigate the effects of ventricular assist device placement on fibrinolysis, and it is anticipated that this model system will be employed in both basic science and clinical investigations in the future."
CD010438,0,6755331,0,[Coagulation disorders in tumors and hemoblastoses].,"Thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications are not rarely seen in the course of malignant diseases. The underlying coagulation disorders were investigated by means of coagulation analysis in 61 patients with solid tumors and 60 control persons as well as 51 patients with leukemia and 50 control persons. As a cause for the thrombotic diathesis in patients with solid tumors and leukemias can be demonstrated a hypercoagulability (shortened PTT and raised factor VIII activity). In addition we found a raised level of fibrinogen, a hypofibrinolysis (prolonged euglobulin lysis time) and in increased platelet aggregation in patients with solid tumors. Predominantly bleeding complications in leukemias are caused by thrombopenia. Another reason, however, may be an activated fibrinolysis or a clot instability because of the reduction of factor XIII. Pathogenetic mechanisms, underlying the tumor induced coagulation disorders, as for example the release of tumor cell thromboplastins from malignant cells are discussed."
CD010438,0,18718092,0,[Application of thrombelastography in evaluation of platelet function during storage].,"This study was aimed to explore changes of platelet function in vitro during storage by thrombelastography (TEG). 12 units plateletpheresis were randomly selected and stored at 20 to 24 degrees C with agitation. Thrombelastography variable parameters R, K values and maximal amplitude (MA) were measured on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days of platelet storage. Platelet concentration, mean platelet volume (MPV), hypotonic shock response (HSR), CD62p expression and CD62p reexpression on platelet surface were detected at the same time. Changes of platelet function in virto were systematically evaluated by above-mentioned indexes. The results showed that MPV augmented slightly with prolongation of preserved time (p > 0.05), and CD62p expression on platelet surface increased remarkably (p < 0.01), while CD62p reexpression decreased gradually (p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in HSR level of platelets during storage (p > 0.05). R value increased with prolongation of preserved time (p < 0.01). There were no obvious changes on K value and alpha Angle during storage (p > 0.05). There were no obvious changes in MA from 1 to 4 days, and MA decreased slightly on day 5 (p < 0.05). It is concluded that there was no significant change in MA and HSR which reflects comprehensive coagulation of platelets during storage. Platelets on the end of storage have excellent function of hemostasis; Thrombelastography parameter MA value can be used as a valuable indicator for evaluation of platelet function in vitro during storage."

Our aim was to assess the presence of a heparin effect on heparinase I-modified TEG in patients before and after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Our hypothesis was that, given the presence of a portosystemic gradient of endotoxaemia, and the role of endotoxaemia on the release of heparinoids, the inflow of portal blood after TIPS might reveal heparinoids through a heparin effect on TEG."
CD010438,0,17003921,0,A direct thrombin inhibitor studied by dynamic whole blood clot formation. Haemostatic response to ex-vivo addition of recombinant factor VIIa or activated prothrombin complex concentrate.,"Direct thrombin inhibitors have proven efficacious in prevention of venous thromboembolism. Bleeding complications are rare, but in case of acute serious bleeding, an effective and instant haemostatic intervention may be required. In the present study it was demonstrated that the direct thrombin inhibitor melagatran induces dose-dependent abnormalities in whole blood (WB) clotting profiles as recorded by a recently described modified thrombelastographic model, and that rFVIIa or APCC are capable of improving the haemostatic capacity. Experiments were performed using WB from 30 healthy males. In-vitro titration experiments (n = 10) with addition of melagatran to WB corresponding to plasma concentrations ranging from 0 to 5.0 microM (12 steps) showed a dose-dependent prolongation of the clot initiation and characteristic decrease of the maximum rate of clot propagation. In-vitro intervention studies (n = 20) were completed with four different concentrations of melagatran as well as addition of four different levels of rFVIIa or APCC. At all tested concentrations of melagatran, rFVIIa significantly shortened the melagatran-induced prolonged clot initiation but induced only minor improvements of the reduced clot propagation. In contrast, APCC significantly and dose-dependently shortened the clot initiation and accelerated the clot propagation. In conclusion, our thrombelastographic model appears useful for evaluating the effect of direct thrombin inhibitors on dynamicWB clot formation and rFVIIa, but especially APCC significantly improved theWB clot formation. The pronounced stabilizing effect of APCC may be caused by its content of prothrombin and activated coagulation factors."

CD010438,0,2665575,0,Intraoperative coagulation changes in children undergoing liver transplantation.,"Intraoperative changes in blood coagulation were observed in eight children undergoing liver transplantation using a simplified coagulation profile (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], and platelet count) and thrombelastography. Preoperatively, PT and aPTT were moderately prolonged (1.5 times control), and platelet count was greater than 100,000/mm3 in all patients but one (91,000/mm3). During the preanhepatic and anhepatic stages, PT, aPTT, reaction time, and coagulation time improved toward normal values, but platelet count and maximum amplitude did not change. Significant changes in coagulation occurred on reperfusion of the grafted liver: PT, aPTT, reaction time, and coagulation time were prolonged, and platelet count, maximum amplitude, and clot formation rate decreased. A heparin effect, which did not require treatment, was seen on reperfusion in four patients. Fibrinolysis occurred during the operation in five patients and was treated with Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) in one. Blood coagulation improved slowly, and values were close to baseline 90 min after reperfusion. In general, the coagulation changes seen in these children are similar to those in adults but less severe, possibly because of the preponderance of cholestatic disease in children compared with the more common hepatocellular disease in adults."
CD010438,0,6655007,0,[Coagulation and the general surgeon. Its physiology and laboratory tests].,"Mechanisms of coagulation and appropriate laboratory tests necessary for general surgical procedures are outlined. Physiologic features discussed include: platelet coagulation (with a brief analysis of the release and the role of prostaglandins); the equilibrium between plasma coagulation and lysis, each dependent on activators and inhibitors (a total of 4 enzymatic systems); and finally the role of the liver, lungs, and reticuloendothelial system. However, the two types of coagulation are narrowly intricated. Vessel endothelium prevents or assists platelet adhesion, coagulation, and lysis. An important feature is that total blood coagulates more rapidly than plasma. Physiopathological features described are activation of platelets or their inhibition by anti-aggregants, and induction of coagulation by endothelial lesions or eruption of an autologous or heterologous protease, as well as a brief outline of consumption coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation, and the concept of hypercoagulability. With respect to laboratory tests it is suggested that an overall picture of coagulation of total blood and not of plasma should be obtained before individual examinations for certain coagulation or lysis elements. Minimum data necessary preoperatively are the coagulation and bleeding times, completed by questioning the patient, the costs of these procedures being insignificant. If laboratory tests are necessary, these should involve a thromboelastogram of total blood, sometimes combined with a test of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Certain plasma tests can provide complementary confirmatory data. These remarks are obviously applicable to general and digestive surgery only, and not to research investigations or the study of rare phenomena."

CD010438,0,19903188,0,Gender and responses to aspirin and clopidogrel: insights using short thrombelastography.,"There is significant variability in both baseline clotting tendency and response to antiplatelet therapy. Responses are associated with outcome. We have investigated whether differences could explain the increased risk observed in women presenting with coronary artery disease. We have utilized short thrombelastography to assess (i) baseline clotting responses, (ii) response to aspirin and clopidogrel, and (iii) post-treatment platelet reactivity in 48 young volunteers, 22 older patients and 18 patients with previous stent thrombosis. Baseline responses were significantly higher in young women than in men. While there was no difference in response to aspirin, platelet reactivity on aspirin remained higher in women (area under curve at 15 min [AUC15] of arachidonic acid channel 332 +/- 122 vs. 172 +/- 80, P= 0.04). Young women had less response to clopidogrel (% reduction in AUC15 with adenosine diphosphate [ADP] 36.4 +/- 12.4 vs. 64.0 +/- 13.2, P < 0.01) in addition to higher post-treatment reactivity (AUC15 of ADP 714 +/- 161 vs. 311 +/- 146, P < 0.01) compared to men. There were no such differences between male and female patients over 50. However, young women with previous stent thrombosis had among the highest platelet reactivity observed. Compared to men, young women have greater baseline clotting tendency, reduced response to clopidogrel, and greater post-treatment reactivity while on both aspirin and clopidogrel. Differences in clotting tendency and response to antiplatelet therapy may contribute to the excess risk observed in young women but are not observed in older female patients."

However, several clinical complications, such as thrombosis, frequently occur in these prostheses when implanted in humans. In this work, an original strategy was developed to improve the hemocompatibility of ePTFE prostheses, based on glow-discharge surface modification followed by chemical grafting of phosphorylcholine, known for its hemocompatible properties. This procedure leads to a covalent attachment of the molecules, therefore preventing their removal by shear stress induced by blood flow at the implant wall. The improvement of the blood compatibility properties of the modified ePTFE arterial prostheses have been investigated by in vitro tests such as thromboelastography, neutrophil adsorption, platelet aggregation, and cell cultures. These in vitro tests put in evidence that thrombogenicity index, platelet aggregation, and neutrophil adhesion were decreased by the molecule grafted on the prostheses. Moreover, the cell growth on the surface of the PRC-grafted prostheses was greatly enhanced in comparison to the virgin prosthesis. Based on these results, it could be concluded that PRC grafting on ePTFE prostheses permit to improve in vitro hemocompatibility and biocompatibility in comparison with their virgin counterpart."

These are frequently given for mild thrombocytopenia (platelets: 50-100 × 10(9) L(-1)), largely because of the known hyporeactivity of neonatal platelets.

CD010438,0,17581317,0,Blood coagulation activation and fibrinolysis during a downhill marathon run.,"Prolonged physical exercise is associated with multiple changes in blood hemostasis. Eccentric muscle activation induces microtrauma of skeletal muscles, inducing an inflammatory response. Since there is a link between inflammation and coagulation we speculated that downhill running strongly activates the coagulation system. Thirteen volunteers participated in the Tyrolean Speed Marathon (42,195 m downhill race, 795 m vertical distance). Venous blood was collected 3 days (T1) and 3 h (T2) before the run, within 30 min after finishing (T3) and 1 day thereafter (T4). We measured the following key parameters: creatine kinase, myoglobin, thrombin-antithrombin complex, prothrombin fragment F1 + 2, D-dimer, plasmin-alpha(2)-antiplasmin complexes, tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen, plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-1 antigen and thrombelastography with ROTEM [intrinsic pathway (InTEM) clotting time, clot formation time, maximum clot firmness, alpha angle]. Thrombin generation was evaluated by the Thrombin Dynamic Test and the Technothrombin TGA test. Creatine kinase and myoglobin were elevated at T3 and further increased at T4. Thrombin-antithrombin complex, prothrombin fragment F1 + 2, D-dimer, plasmin-alpha(2)-antiplasmin complexes, tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen and plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-1 antigen were significantly increased at T3. ROTEM analysis exhibited a shortening of InTEM clotting time and clot formation time after the marathon, and an increase in InTEM maximum clot firmness and alpha angle. Changes in TGA were indicative for thrombin generation after the marathon. We demonstrated that a downhill marathon induces an activation of coagulation, as measured by specific parameters for coagulation, ROTEM and thrombin generation assays. These changes were paralleled by an activation of fibrinolysis indicating a preserved hemostatic balance."
CD010438,0,18555151,0,Epidural anesthesia? No of course.,"Although the contraindications for thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) are well defined, the debate continues about whether TEA improves outcomes. Pro and con trials and a metaanalysis in the past have yielded equivocal results; they did not deal with new vascular intervention or drugs. The benefit of TEA in surgery is to provide analgesia. In subgroups, TEA can decrease the mortality and morbidity. In contrast, the cost can increase in the situation of a complication that is opposite to the side effects is rare, but the impairment caused by them is out of proportion to the benefits. Primary or secondary prophylaxis with antithrombotic drugs is increasing in developed countries because of the increasing cardiovascular interventions and aging of the population. The neuroaxial guidelines are useful, but the changing of the coagulation profile after hepatectomy is not included in them. The decision to use TEA in liver surgery must be individualized with steps planned from the beginning. TEA suitability is based on an evaluation of the contraindications, comorbidities, coagulation profiles, hepatic reserve, and balance of benefits and risks. The insertion or withdrawal of the epidural catheter should be made with care according to the neuroaxial guidelines and in the presence of a normal TEG. The decreasing level of prothrombin content and platelet counts after hepatectomy should be closely monitored every 2 to 5 days."

The etiology of the hypercoagulability is multifactorial, involving various clotting factors or pathways (for example platelets, fibrinogen, individual components of the clotting system and/or fibrinolysis in different studies). The development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with the uremia-related platelet effect has the potential to protect from the existing hypercoagulable state. This has important implications for surgery, particularly simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation, where the pancreas has historically been prone to thrombosis.

CD010438,0,23247121,0,Functional fibrinogen assay indicates that fibrinogen is critical in correcting abnormal clot strength following trauma.,"Thromboelastography (TEG) is emerging as the standard in the management of acute coagulopathies in injured patients. Although TEG is sensitive in detecting abnormalities in clot strength, one shortcoming is differentiating between fibrinogen and platelet contributions to clot integrity. Current American algorithms suggest platelet transfusion, whereas European guidelines suggest fibrinogen concentrates for correcting low clot strength. Therefore, we hypothesized that a TEG-based functional fibrinogen (FF) assay would assess the contribution of fibrinogen and platelets to clot strength and provide insight to transfusion priorities. Blood samples were obtained from trauma patients on arrival to the emergency department or who were admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (n = 68). Citrated kaolin TEG, FF, and von Clauss fibrinogen levels (plasma-based clinical standard) were measured. Correlations were assessed using linear regression models. In vitro studies were also performed with adding fibrinogen concentrates to blood collected from healthy volunteers (n = 10). Functional fibrinogen and citrated kaolin TEG parameters were measured. Functional fibrinogen strongly correlated with von Clauss fibrinogen levels (R = 0.87) and clot strength (R = 0.80). The mean fibrinogen contribution to clot strength was 30%; however, there was a direct linear relationship with fibrinogen level and percent fibrinogen contribution to clot strength (R = 0.83). Traditional TEG parameters associated with fibrinogen activity (α angle and kinetic time) had significantly lower correlations with FF (R = 0.70 and 0.35). Furthermore, platelet count had only a moderate correlation to clot strength (R = 0.51). The addition of fibrinogen concentrate in in vitro studies increased clot strength (MA) (60.44 ± 1.48 to 68.12 ± 1.39) and percent fibrinogen contribution to clot strength (23.8% ± 1.8% to 37.7% ± 2.5%). Functional fibrinogen can be performed rapidly with TEG and correlates well with the standard von Clauss fibrinogen assay. Both fibrinogen and platelet contribution of clot strength can be derived from FF. Moreover, FF had a stronger correlation to clot strength, and increased levels were directly associated with increased percent contribution to clot strength. In vitro studies also demonstrated an increase in FF, clot strength, and percent fibrinogen contribution to clot strength with the addition of fibrinogen concentrate. These data suggest that fibrinogen should be addressed early in trauma patients manifesting acute coagulopathy of trauma."

CD010438,0,8785143,0,Haemodilution induces a hypercoagulable state.,"It has been suggested that haemodilution with saline may increase whole blood coagulation. This study was conducted in two parts. First, we investigated the effect of in vitro dilution of blood with saline on whole blood coagulation as measured by the thrombelastogram (TEG). Blood (4 ml) was diluted with 0.9% saline 1 ml and coagulation compared with that of an undiluted control specimen obtained concurrently from the same subject. In the second part, the study was repeated using a modified gelatin colloidal solution (Haemaccel) as the diluent. The r time, k time and r + k time were decreased relative to control in both diluent groups. The alpha angles were increased compared with control in both groups while maximum amplitude was unchanged in the Haemaccel diluted group. We conclude that haemodilution per se increases the coagulability of whole blood in vitro, but that saline haemodilution has a more marked effect on final clot strength."

In a randomized, blinded, prospective trial, we studied cardiac surgical patients at moderate to high risk of transfusion. Patients were randomly assigned to either a thromboelastography (TEG)-guided transfusion algorithm (n = 53) or routine transfusion therapy (n = 52) for intervention after cardiopulmonary bypass. Coagulation tests, TEG variables, mediastinal tube drainage, and transfusions were compared at multiple time points. There were no demographic or hemostatic test result differences between groups, and all patients were given prophylactic antifibrinolytic therapy. Intraoperative transfusion rates did not differ, but there were significantly fewer postoperative and total transfusions in the TEG group. The proportion of patients receiving fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) was 4 of 53 in the TEG group compared with 16 of 52 in the control group (P < 0.002). Patients receiving platelets were 7 of 53 in the TEG group compared with 15 of 52 in the control group (P < 0.05). Patients in the TEG group also received less volume of FFP (36 +/- 142 vs 217 +/- 463 mL; P < 0.04). Mediastinal tube drainage was not statistically different 6, 12, or 24 h postoperatively. Point-of-care coagulation monitoring using TEG resulted in fewer transfusions in the postoperative period. We conclude that the reduction in transfusions may have been due to improved hemostasis in these patients who had earlier and specific identification of the hemostasis abnormality and thus received more appropriate intraoperative transfusion therapy.

The infusion-transfusion therapy (ITT) contained transfusion media about 1/3 of the total volume, fresh-frozen plasma and erythrocyte-containing media were used 1:1. Infusion solutions consisted of balanced polyelectrolytic solutions, hydroxyethylated starches 130/0.4, hyperchaes. Intraoperative normovolemic hemodilution and reinfusion of wound blood were made (CellSaver). ITT target markers were standard hemodynamics control tests. Hemostasis monitoring was conducted with thromboelastography. Complex ITT based on modern principles of clinical transfusiology provided a complete and safe compensation of massive intraoperative blood loss in a patient with severe hemophilia."

Haemodilution with HES, GEL and ALB significantly (P < 0.05) compromised coagulation time (k), angle alpha and maximal amplitude (MA), with HES having the most negative effect at 30% and 60% haemodilution (P < 0.05). Haemodilution with saline significantly affected all variables of blood coagulation and clot lysis measured by thrombelastography, resulting in an increased coagulability at 30% haemodilution. To specifically assess the intrinsic effect of plasma expander molecules on blood coagulation and clot lysis, we analysed the difference between saline diluted blood (same degree of haemodilution) and plasma expander diluted blood. Prolongation of reaction time (r) was found for HES at 30% and 60% haemodilution and for ALB at 60% haemodilution and an increase in clot lysis by HES, GEL and ALB became evident. We conclude that HES, GEL and ALB compromised blood coagulation, while the maximum effect was found with HES."

Therefore we tested the hypothesis that the use of a rapid infusion device, which was originally designed for liver transplantations, can prevent hypovolemic shock. We studied 20 patients: in one group (n = 10) the iv volume was given in a conventional way (37 degrees C) by use of pressure infusion bags. Patients of the second group (n = 10) received the iv volume via the Rapid Infusion system (Haemonetics Corp., Braintree, MA).

Significant increases in adrenaline, factor VIII and fibrinogen were found only after exercise to exhaustion at 1500 kpm min-1 whereas the euglobulin lysis time was inversely proportional to the excercise load. There was no change in platelet adhesiveness. These findings support the results of studies using adrenaline infusions or adrenergic blockade which suggest that stress-induced increases in factor VIII are mediated via adrenergic stimulation but that activation of fibrinolysis is not dependent on adrenaline."

Recently, we demonstrated moderate activation of coagulation after a long-haul flight. At present the single contributing factors (i.e. hypoxia and low humidity on board an aircraft and prolonged sitting in an aircraft, car or bus inducing venous stasis) have not yet been investigated. Therefore we measured markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis as well as functional parameters of coagulation using activated thrombelastography in 19 healthy volunteers before, during and after a real 10-h bus journey. In addition, changes in leg volume were measured. Thrombelastography revealed moderate activation of coagulation in all travelers, which was accompanied by a significant increase in prothrombin fragment F1 + 2. Thrombin-antithrombin III complexes and D-dimer remained unchanged, and tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1 decreased after travel. After the travel we found a significant increase in leg volume that was exclusively distributed in the calf. We conclude that beside long-haul flights also long-distance bus travel induces a certain activation of the coagulation system. Thus, it is questionable whether hypoxia is the crucial risk factor for thromboembolic events after long-haul flights."
CD010438,0,19408191,0,Diagnostic evaluation of platelet function disorders in neonates and children: an update.,"Investigation of platelet function disorders in infants and small children requires the collaborative efforts of clinicians and clinical laboratories. A detailed personal, family, and medication history, and a search for additional clinical phenomena may help to direct diagnostic laboratory investigations. Testing for these disorders in young children presents several challenges: the requirement of relatively large volumes of blood, lack of standardization, and the absence of well-established age-specific reference ranges. Neonates show the most notable differences in platelet function compared to older children and adults; the decreased platelet activation responses persist for the first 2 to 4 weeks after delivery. Small studies of normal postneonatal pediatric populations have provided data on platelet function assays, including bleeding times, PFA-100 closure times, thromboelastography, aggregation, secretion, and flow cytometry. The majority of these studies, comparing normal children with adults, found only minor differences in platelet responses measured by these assays."

CD010438,0,15572250,0,The ultrastructure of fibrinogen-420 and the fibrin-420 clot.,"Fibrinogen-420 is a minor subclass of human fibrinogen that is so named because of its higher molecular weight compared to fibrinogen-340, the predominant form of circulating fibrinogen. Each of the two Aalpha chains of fibrinogen-340 is replaced in fibrinogen-420 by an Aalpha isoform termed alphaE. Such chains contain a globular C-terminal extension, alphaEC, that is homologous with the C-terminal regions of Bbeta and gamma chains in the fibrin D domain. The alphaEC domain lacks a functional fibrin polymerization pocket like those found in the D domain, but it does contain a binding site for beta2 integrins. Electron microscopy of fibrinogen-340 molecules showed the major core fibrinogen domains, D-E-D, plus globular portions of the C-terminal alphaC domains. Fibrinogen-420 molecules had two additional globular domains that were attributable to alphaEC. Turbidity measurements of thrombin-cleaved fibrinogen-420 revealed a reduced rate of fibrin polymerization and a lower maximum turbidity. Thromboelastographic measurements also showed a reduced rate of fibrin-420 polymerization (amplitude development) compared with fibrin-340. Nevertheless, the final amplitude (MA) and the calculated elastic modulus (G) for fibrin-420 were greater than those for fibrin-340. These results suggested a greater degree of fibrin-420 branching and thinner matrix fibers, and such structures were found in SEM images. In addition, fibrin-420 fibers were irregular and often showed nodular structures protruding from the fiber surface. These nodularities represented alphaEC domains, and possibly alphaC domains as well. TEM images of negatively shadowed fibrin-420 networks showed irregular fiber borders, but the fibers possessed the same 22.5-nm periodicity that characterizes all fibrin fibers. From this result, we conclude that fibrin-420 fiber assembly occurs through the same D-E interactions that drive the assembly of all fibrin fibrils, and therefore that the staggered overlapping molecular packing arrangement is the same in both types of fibrin. The alphaEC domains are arrayed on fiber surfaces, and in this location, they would very likely slow lateral fibril association, causing thinner, more branched fibers to form. However, their location on the fiber surface would facilitate cellular interactions through the integrin receptor binding site."

CD010438,0,15281516,0,The impact of factor XIII on coagulation kinetics and clot strength determined by thrombelastography.,"Fibrinogen has been shown to be responsible for most protein-mediated clot strength via thrombelastography. However, factor XIII (FXIII) activity also plays a prominent role in the development of clot strength. Thus, we hypothesized that changes in FXIII activity would significantly increase clot strength. FXIII (0%, 1%, 6.25%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, and 100% normal activity) was placed in a fixed volume of citrated FXIII-deficient plasma with 1% tissue factor and calcium chloride and underwent thrombelastography for 10 min. We measured the variables reaction time (R; a measurement of clot initiation), alpha (a measure of the rate of clot formation), amplitude (A; a measure of clot strength), and shear elastic modulus (G; a measure of clot strength). FXIII activity significantly decreased R in a pattern of exponential decay (R2 = 0.77; P < 0.001). FXIII activity significantly increased alpha, following a sigmoidal pattern (R2 = 0.88; P < 0.001). Finally, increases in FXIII activity significantly increased A and G in a sigmoidal pattern (R = 0.89; P < 0.001). We concluded that FXHI significantly affects R, alpha, A, and G. Thus, transfusion decision making with protein-mediated thrombelastographic patterns must account for the contribution of both fibrinogen and FXIII."

Two crematories located in southern Taiwan were investigated, including the one (C1) with no air pollution control device installed and the other (C2) installed with a bag filter. Results show the mean PCDD/F emissions (11% oxygen) from the stacks of Cl and C2 were 2.36 and 0.322 ng I-TEQ Nm(-3), respectively. The mean emission factors for C1 and C2 were 13.6 and 6.11 microg I-TEQ body(-1), respectively. The removal efficiency of the bag filter on PCDD/Fs was 55.1%. The estimated PCDD/F emission rate for all crematories in Taiwan was 0.838 g I-TEG yr(-1) accounting for 227% and 112% of the annual emissions from all medical waste incinerators and municipal waste incinerators, respectively. The above results indicate that PCDD/F emissions from crematories were quite significant. To assess the impact of PCDD/F emissions from a crematory to the surrounding environment, ambient air samples were collected from the downwind site of C1 with the maximum ground concentration. We found the estimated maximum ground concentration at the downwind site of C1 (= 0.521 pg I-TEQ Nm(-3)) was much higherthan thatfound atthe background, rural area, residential area, urban area, and industrial area (= 0.006, 0.023, 0.052, 0.093, and 0.190 pg I-TEG Nm(-3), respectively). The above results suggestthat PCDD/F emissions from a crematory did significantly affect its surrounding environment. In conclusion, a proper control strategy should be taken immediately in order to eliminate PCDD/F emissions from crematories."

We evaluated the ability of TEG to assess the effects of antiplatelet therapy on clot formation using a novel assessment parameter (the area under curve). Forty healthy volunteers were divided into four groups of 10. Group A took aspirin 75 mg once daily for 7 days followed by aspirin 75 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg once daily in combination for 7 more days. Blood samples were taken for analysis at day 0 and days 7 and 14. Group B took a single 300 mg dose of aspirin. Group C took 600 mg of clopidogrel only. Group D took 300 mg of aspirin and 600 mg of clopidogrel at the same time. For groups B, C and D blood was taken prior to drug administration and at 2, 6 and 24 h afterwards. Each sample was tested by TEG in four channels following activation using (1) kaolin, (2) activator F (Act F), a direct activator of fibrin, (3) Act F + arachidonic acid (AA) and (4) Act F + adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Parameters measured included the maximum amplitude (MA) of the clot and the area under the TEG-generated curve at 1 h. Significant, time-dependent reductions in MA and area were seen in the AA-activated samples following administration of aspirin in all groups as compared to baseline. By contrast, there were no significant differences in MA or area in the AA-activated samples with clopidogrel alone. Significant reductions were also seen in MA and area in ADP-activated samples from volunteers treated with clopidogrel as compared to baseline. Three out of 10 subjects receiving 600 mg clopidogrel had a reduction in their responses of 30% or less, thus identifying them as relatively resistant to the drug. This study identifies a rapid, reliable method for assessing the time-dependent effects of antiplatelet therapy on clotting using a novel parameter of area of the TEG trace, which could have an important clinical application as a point of care test of efficacy, particularly in the context of acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary intervention."
CD010438,0,16973498,0,Platelet-dependent coagulation assays for factor VIII efficacy measurement after substitution therapy in patients with haemophilia A.,"FVIII therapy for haemophilia A is safe and effective, with the problem of individually sufficient efficacy unsettled. Routine one-stage clotting assays and tests employing chromogenic substrates poorly detect individual haemostatic effects of FVIII due to artificial test conditions. In particular, the use of cell-free and diluted plasma samples neglect the crucial role of platelets for thrombin and fibrin formation. To optimize FVIII substitution therapy, we measured in 40 patients with severe to mild haemophilia A before and after FVIII substitution the FVIII activity in cell-free plasma samples using a one-stage clotting assay as well a chromogenic substrate assay and compared the data with those obtained with cell-based coagulation tests, i.e. thrombin generation in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and thromboelastography (TEG) in samples of citrated whole blood (WB). To determine the maximum ex vivo haemostatic effect we added 1 unit/ml of FVIII to samples of PRP and WB and measured the maximum thrombin generation in the thrombin generation test (TGT) and the maximum clot firmness (MCF) in TEG. After FVIII substitution we observed a nearly linear relation between the individual FVIII activities administered to the patients and the activities measured in the plasma samples. However, data obtained with TGT and TEG revealed a high inter-individual variation and a very poor correlation to the administered FVIII activity. Actually, it could be shown that FVIII substitution yielding in a FVIII plasma activity of about 30% is sufficient to get an ex vivo haemostatic effect of more that 90% as measured by maximum thrombin generation and MCF. FVIII substitution up to a plasma activity of more than 90% did not further enhance the haemostatic effect. Our data clearly demonstrate that the haemostatic effect of FVIII is not only dependent on the activity that is measured in plasma but also depends on the interplay between coagulation and blood cells, in particular with platelets. The use of cell-based coagulation tests such us TGT or TEG may help to optimize FVIII therapy by determining the individual FVIII dosage that produces a maximum haemostatic effect."

Because of the growing demand for autologous platelet gel (APG) in cardiac surgery, many open heart teams are faced with the choice of using their existing ABRS or purchasing a dedicated PRP device. This study was conducted to address the issues we had about our use of the Haemonetics Cell Saver 5 (CS5) to collect PRP during open heart surgery at our institution. PRP and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) were collected on 20 ""first-time"" elective open heart surgical patients. Baseline, PRP, and PPP platelet counts, as well as modified thrombelastograms (TEGs), were performed on all study patients. The mean baseline, PRP, and PPP platelet counts were 232,450, 1,348,850, and 18,100/mm3, respectively. We found a strong positive correlation (r = +0.7142) between the maximum amplitude (MA) of our modified PRP TEG and the platelet count of the PRP. Using the CS5, we achieved a mean platelet multiple of greater than six times baseline, which compares favorably with the multiple produced using dedicated PRP devices. These data support the conclusion that we achieved a high platelet multiple with the CS5, and our use of a modified TEG showed that platelet function of the collected PRP was preserved."

Given the potential for thrombotic complications to result from hypercoagulable states, we sought to determine whether postoperative blood analysis using thromboelastography could predict the occurrence of thrombotic complications, including myocardial infarction (MI). We prospectively enrolled 240 patients undergoing a wide variety of surgical procedures. A cardiac risk score was assigned to each patient using the established revised Goldman risk index. Thromboelastography was performed immediately after surgery and maximum amplitude (MA), representing clot strength, was determined. Postoperative thrombotic complications requiring confirmation by a diagnostic test were assessed by a blinded observer. Ten patients (4.2%) suffered a total of 12 postoperative thrombotic complications. The incidence of thrombotic complications with increased MA (8 of 95 = 8.4%) was significantly (P = 0.0157) more frequent than that of patients with MA < or =68 (2 of 145 = 1.4%). Furthermore, the percentage suffering postoperative MI in the increased MA group (6 of 95 = 6.3%) was significantly larger than that in the MA < or =68 group (0 of 145 = 0%) (P = 0.0035). In a multivariate analysis, increased MA (P = 0.013; odds ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.20) and Goldman risk score (P = 0.046; odds ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-5.61) both independently predicted postoperative MI.

Our aim was to investigate cord blood clot formation of pre-term versus full-term infants and adults, using rotating thromboelastogram (ROTEM), Pentafarm, Munich, Germany). ROTEM was investigated in cord blood of 184 full-term and 47 pre-term infants. Measurements of the clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT) and maximal clot firmness (MCF) were obtained in order to asses reference values for this age group, and compare between full-term and pre-term neonates and compared to adult controls. For each infant demographic information and data regarding pregnancy and delivery were gathered. Infants were prospectively followed until discharge. CT and CFT were significantly shorter among pre-term and term infants as compared to adults [median CT: 185, 194, 293 seconds respectively, p pound0.001, CFT: 80, 76, 103 seconds respectively, p pound0.001). MCF was lower in pre-term and term as compared to adults (p pound0.001) with significantly lower values in pre-term as compared to full-term neonates (p=0.004). Clotting time and MCF correlated with gestational age (R=0.132, p=0.045, R= 0.259, p<0.001, respectively). No association was found between any ROTEM values and the occurrence of post-natal complications in infants of our study group. This is the first study assessing clot formation by ROTEM in pre-term infants. Clot formation parameters of term and premature infants correlated with gestational age.

These results agreed with the platelet aggregation tests, showing a degree of platelet inhibition, but it was the overall clotting profile (basic thrombelastograph), showing a borderline hyper-coagulable state, that was of most interest and commonly seen in pregnancy. We believe a TEG result within acceptable limits could help re-adjust the risk of spinal haematomas following regional anaesthesia, thereby, reducing the risks of difficult intubation and general anaesthetic exposure to the baby. The case study describes both basic and platelet mapping thrombelastographs and their potential role in not only this patient with Gray Platelet Syndrome, but any obstetric patient where there are bleeding concerns."
CD010438,0,3662735,0,[Ultrastructural differences of fibrin coagulation before and after cardiovascular arrest].,"The reconstruction of killing offences often requires the differentiation between vital and postmortal blood traces at the sites of action and finding. Earlier investigations seemed to imply the possibility of such a differentiation depending on the different clot structure. We therefore examined clots prior and after 10 minutes of complete occlusion of the upper extremity morphologically and morphometrically with the REM. The morphologic comparison of these clots revealed narrow, round shaped fibrin fiber networks for clots of native blood, whereas clots after occlusion showed linear, rarely connected long fibrin fibers. The morphometry of the fibrin free spaces revealed a significant enlargement of the single fibrin free spaces as well as of the total fibrin free space after occlusion. For capillary blood a significant decrease in fiber diameter was observed after occlusion. The examination of clinical clotting parameters revealed alterations of thrombocyte aggregation for the collagen induction, a slightly reduced thrombocyte retention and slightly steeper flanks in the thromboelastogram after occlusion. The reason for these changes was interpreted as lack of high energetic phosphates in the retraction process as the clotting cascade itself requires a very high amount of these phosphates. Use of these results in the forensic practice will have to take factors as temperature, drying out, surface-structure and many others into account."
CD010438,0,1725638,0,[Experiences with autologous donation and transfusion equipment].,"For autologous plasma predeposit there are commonly two types of cell-separators in use: 1. Discontinuous centrifugation (Plasma Collection System PCS, Haemonetics Company). 2. Discontinuous membrane filtration (Plasmapur-Monitor, Organon Teknika Company). Normally donation volume is 900 ml. The rate of undesired secondary effects does not exceed those numbers known of regular homologous donors. Shed wound blood processing by a wash-centrifuge cell separator (Type Cell-Saver, Haemonetics Company) stands for optimal quality of the refusable red blood cells. Depending on the type of operation and the accuracy of wound blood suction, up to 75% of the red blood cells lost may be harvested. In order to achieve more widespread mechanical autotransfusion, one issue is to lower the rather high costs of the disposables by simplifying the too highly sophisticated systems. From clinical experience with orthopedic patients, at least practical advice is given on how to use the single autologous transfusion methods in a comprehensive strategy."

CD010438,0,16676074,0,The influence of fibrin polymerization and platelet-mediated contractile forces on citrated whole blood thromboelastography profile.,"Thromboelastography analysis providing a global assessment of coagulation is gaining new interest in clinical practice. MinimalTF triggered whole blood thromboelastography provides a valuable tool for studying the kinetics of clot formation (expressed by the parameters R, K and alpha-angle) and the physical characteristics of the clot, such as its firmness and the elastic modulus shear (expressed by the parameters maximal amplitude MA and G). We studied the influence of fibrin polymerization and platelet functional status on each parameter of thromboelastographic trace obtained by minimalTF activation inWB by employing increasing concentrations of a fibrin polymerization inhibitors (the tetrapeptide Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro-OH.AcOH; Pefabloc-FG) and an inhibitor of actin polymerization (Cytochalasin D). Pefabloc-FG at concentrations higher than 5 mg/ml prolonged the R and K times and decreased the alpha-angle in a concentration-dependent manner but it did not modify MA and G parameters. At the concentration of 5 mg/ml, Pefabloc-FG completely inhibited clot formation. Cytochalasin D had no effect on R time but decreased the alpha-angle, MA and G parameters by reaching a plateau at the concentration of 5 microM. The effect of cytochalasin D was more pronounced on MA and G than on the alpha-angle. A combination of both Pefabloc-FG (0.5 mg/ml) and cytochalasin D (50 microM) significantly decreased alpha-angle compared to control as well as their single effect. However, G value was dramatically reduced in the presence of cytochalasin D exposure, without any additional effect when both inhibitors were combined. This study confirms the importance of fibrin polymerisation on the kinetics of thrombus formation and demonstrates the close association between the quality of the thrombus and the functional status of platelets. Normal platelet contractile forces are of major importance for the maximum amplitude of TEG which is related to the strength and elastic modulus of the thrombus."

The effect of profound haemodilution (50%) on coagulation profile was measured in vitro by thromboelastography. Blood samples were taken from 11 ASA grade 1 patients prior to induction of anaesthesia for elective surgery. Each sample was simultaneously tested in four different preparations: undiluted blood (control sample); blood diluted with hydroxyethyl starch 6%; blood diluted with modified fluid gelatin 4%; blood diluted with dextran 40 10%. There was a significant decrease in reaction time in the preparations treated with hydroxyethyl starch 6% and modified fluid gelatin 4%, reflecting activation of initial fibrin formation. A significant increase in clot formation time was noted in the hydroxyethyl starch 6%-treated preparations. There was also a significant decrease in clot formation rate and maximum amplitude in the hydroxyethyl starch 6% group. Clot formation time, clot formation rate and maximum amplitude did not change in the modified fluid gelatin 4% group.

CD010438,0,19135193,0,Exsanguination in trauma: A review of diagnostics and treatment options.,"Trauma patients with haemorrhagic shock who only transiently respond or do not respond to fluid therapy and/or the administration of blood products have exsanguinating injuries. Recognising shock due to (exsanguinating) haemorrhage in trauma is about constructing a synthesis of trauma mechanism, injuries, vital signs and the therapeutic response of the patient. The aim of prehospital care of bleeding trauma patients is to deliver the patient to a facility for definitive care within the shortest amount of time by rapid transport and minimise therapy to what is necessary to maintain adequate vital signs. Rapid decisions have to be made using regional trauma triage protocols that have incorporated patient condition, transport times and the level of care than can be performed by the prehospital care providers and the receiving hospitals. The treatment of bleeding patients is aimed at two major goals: stopping the bleeding and restoration of the blood volume. Fluid resuscitation should allow for preservation of vital functions without increasing the risk for further (re)bleeding. To prevent further deterioration and subsequent exsanguinations 'permissive hypotension' may be the goal to achieve. Within the hospital, a sound trauma team activation system, including the logistic procedure as well as activation criteria, is essential for a fast and adequate response. After determination of haemorrhagic shock, all efforts have to be directed to stop the bleeding in order to prevent exsanguinations. A simultaneous effort is made to restore blood volume and correct coagulation. Reversal of coagulopathy with pharmacotherapeutic interventions may be a promising concept to limit blood loss after trauma. Abdominal ultrasound has replaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage for detection of haemoperitoneum. With the development of sliding-gantry based computer tomography diagnostic systems, rapid evaluation by CT-scanning of the trauma patient is possible during resuscitation. The concept of damage control surgery, the staged approach in treatment of severe trauma, has proven to be of vital importance in the treatment of exsanguinating trauma patients and is adopted worldwide. When performing 'blind' transfusion or 'damage control resuscitation', a predetermined fixed ratio of blood components may result in the administration of higher plasma and platelets doses and may improve outcome. The role of thromboelastography and thromboelastometry as point-of-care tests for coagulation in massive blood loss is emerging, providing information about actual clot formation and clot stability, shortly (10min) after the blood sample is taken. Thus, therapy guided by the test results will allow for administration of specific coagulation factors that will be depleted despite administration with fresh frozen plasma during massive transfusion of blood components."

Hemostatic changes were apparent within 3 months of OC use. Hematocrit (Hct) was not affected, but hemoglobin (Hb) concentration decreased by 18 months. Shortened prothrombin time (PT) and activated plasma thromboplastin time (APTT) were associated with elevated fibrinogen within the 12-month use of both OCs. Factor VII was reduced only in Micro 30 during the 18 months of use. Enhanced thrombin-antithrombin (TAT)-complex level was seen at 18 months of Gynera use. Prothrombin fragment1+2 (F1+2) rise was seen at 3 months with Micro 30. Reduced antithrombin III (ATIII) activity was seen at 18 months with Gynera and at 24 months with Micro 30. Increased protein C activity was seen at 3 months and reduced protein S occurred at 18 months of Gynera use. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity was enhanced for 6 months in both OCs with raised D-dimer levels for 12 months with Gynera and 6 months with Micro 30. Decreased t-PA antigen was seen at 18 months and decreased urokinaselike plasminogen activator (u-PA) antigen occurred throughout the 24 months of both OCs use. Enhanced u-PA activity was only seen in Gynera users. Elevated plasminogen levels were apparent throughout both OCs use. PAI-1 levels were significantly decreased with Micro 30. With Gynera, the decreased PAI-1 activity was seen only at 18 months and PAI-1 antigen at 12 months. No change in platelets and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were seen in long-term OC use except that beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) showed decreased trends reaching statistical significance by 18 and 24 months of Micro 30 use and by 24 months of Gynera use. A further significant decrease in beta-TG, u-PA antigen, ATIII, and protein S levels were seen 3 months after pill stoppage compared with pretreatment levels. Activated protein C resistance (APCR) was negative in all subjects before and during OC use. The study indicated dynamic balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis with no endothelial activation. However, because some hemostatic markers showed wide fluctuations during OC use, a longer term study is warranted to investigate any adverse hemostatic changes that might enhance the risks of venous thromboembolism in Asian subjects known to be less prone to thrombosis."

To assess the effects of different glycosaminoglycans on thrombelastography parameters and the reversibility of these effects by heparinase-I-modified thrombelastography. Twenty volunteers were enrolled. Solutions of heparan sulphate, dermatan sulphate, and chondroitin-4-sulphate were prepared at 'equivalent' concentrations, based on the composition and anticoagulant activity of danaparoid. Serial dilutions of each glycosaminoglycan were prepared to achieve 1.0, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05 U/ml. Native and heparinase-modified thrombelastography, anti-activated factor X activity and heparin cofactor II activity were evaluated at each concentration. A statistically significant heparin-like effect was seen with 1 and 0.5 U/ml heparan sulphate, and 1 and 0.5 U/ml dermatan sulphate, which was completely reversed by heparinase-modified thrombelastography. Anti-activated factor X activity was significantly increased in samples containing heparan and dermatan sulphates. The heparin cofactor II activity decreased with 1.0 and 0.5 U/ml dermatan sulphate and chondroitin-4-sulphate, but not with heparan sulphate. Heparan and dermatan sulphates affect haemostasis when added to whole blood in vitro, detectable by native thrombelastography and completely reversed by heparinase-I-modified thrombelastography. They may therefore be responsible for the heparin-like effect seen by thrombelastography in patients with cirrhosis and bacterial infection."

These assays allow to observe and conclude that: 1) The agglutination phenomena are almost constant except with red blood cells. The agglutinates are dissociable by shaking. The agglutination appears to be nonspecific of a niosome component but is not observed with ""classical"" DPPC-chol-DCP liposomes. 2) Albumin and eventually transferrin are adsorbed at the surface of niosomes but without destabilizing them. 3) The vesicules show no important effects on coagulation factors, the enhancement of clotting time appearing essentially the consequence of blood dilution. 4) Niosomes phagocytosis is important but all the measurements fail to show any cellular metabolism activation: cell oxygen consumption, oxygenated metabolites generation and oxydases activity are not enhanced whatever the ""electric"" charge or the niosomes/phagocytes ratio used."

Predonation of autologous blood generally reduces the need for homologous blood by about 30% to 40%, but relatively few coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) patients predonate blood. Drug products to decrease blood use include 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP), tranexamic acid, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, and aprotinin. A recent study suggests that a subgroup of patients with abnormal platelet function may benefit from a platelet therapy such as DDAVP. The prophylactic use of tranexamic acid reduces cardiac surgery postoperative blood loss, as measured by chest-tube output, by about 30%; unfortunately, data demonstrating a reduction in transfusion requirements are not available. Aprotinin use is associated with major reductions in blood transfusion requirements. Aprotinin provides platelet protection during cardiopulmonary bypass. Duration of stay in the intensive care unit was not increased by use of aprotinin, thus alleviating some concerns that aprotinin might promote coronary thrombosis. A recent report cites early graft closure as a major concern with aprotinin therapy, but data from other studies show no significant differences in rates of graft closure between patients receiving and those not receiving aprotinin. Routine use of a thromboelastogram with all cardiopulmonary bypass surgery at the University of Washington Hospital has reduced use of blood products by 30%."

The values obtained from the TEG were: R phase (indicative of thrombokinase and thrombin formation disorders), K phase (indicative of fibrinogenesis) and MA phase (providing information on clot stability and platelet function). The patients were divided into two groups based upon 24 h blood loss; Group 1 - blood loss less than 0.7 ml/kg/h and Group 2 - blood loss greater than 0.7 ml/kg/h. In Group 2 there was a highly significant correlation between post-protamine MA phase and platelet number (r = 0.93, p less than 0.001) but there was no correlation in Group 1 (p greater than 0.1). Furthermore, in Group 2 elevated postoperative blood loss was associated with a prolonged K phase (mean [SD] 12.0 [6.0] versus 6.3 [2.1] min, p less than 0.05) and diminished MA phase (37 [12.5] versus 56 [4.9] mm, p less than 0.01) relative to preoperative values. In Group 1, K and MA phase did not alter significantly (p greater than 0.5 and p greater than 0.2, respectively). TEG predicted with 100% (8/8) accuracy increased post-operative bleeding.

The anticoagulant properties of the LMW heparin are characterized by a doubled half life of factor Xa activity, smaller influence on aPTT and thrombin after intravenous (i.v.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) injection, and higher bioavailability of factor Xa activity after s.c. administration (90% versus 15%). Protamine chloride completely neutralizes the effect on aPTT and thrombin and reduces the anti factor Xa activity by 60%. The bleeding time is prolonged by both normal and LMW heparin by 20%. This effect is normalized by protamine chloride, too. Thrombelastography with recalcified whole blood demonstrates that protamine chloride shortens but not completely normalizes the coagulation time in presence of either unfractionated or LMW heparin. The half life of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity is 60 min after i.v. administration of unfractionated heparin and 120 min with LMW heparin. Although the release of lipases (LPL and HTGL) is higher after i.v. and s.c. administration of the LMW heparin they do not induce higher releases of free fatty acids. This indicates that the lipolytic activity of this LMW heparin and unfractionated heparin is similar. The results show an improved anticoagulant pharmacological profile of this LMW heparin as compared to unfractionated heparin. Protamine normalizes the anticoagulant effects of LMW heparin with exception of a residual anti factor Xa activity and normalizes the changes of bleeding time and thrombelastography."

Thus, my goal was to elucidate how colloids decrease plasma coagulation function. Plasma was diluted 0% or 40% with 0.9% NaCl, three different hydroxyethyl starches (HES, mean molecular weight 450, 220 or 130 kDa), or 5% human albumin. Samples (n=6 per condition) were activated with celite, and diluted samples had either no additions or addition of fibrinogen (FI), thrombin (FIIa) or activated Factor XIII (FXIIIa) to restore protein function to prediluted values. Thrombelastographic variables measured included clot propagation (angle, alpha), and clot strength (amplitude, A; or shear elastic modulus, G). Dilution with 0.9% NaCl significantly decreased alpha, A and G-values compared to undiluted samples. Supplementation with FI, but not FIIa or FXIIIa, resulted in 0.9% NaCl-diluted thrombelastographic variable values not different from those of undiluted samples. FI supplementation of HES 450, HES 220, HES 130 and albumin-diluted samples only partially restored alpha, A and G-values compared to undiluted samples. FIIa addition only improved clot propagation and strength in albumin-diluted samples. FXIIIa supplementation improved propagation in samples diluted with HES 450, HES 220 and albumin, and clot strength improved in HES 450 and albumin-diluted plasma. Considered as a whole, these data support compromise of FIIa-FI and FXIIIa--fibrin polymer interactions as the mechanisms by which colloids compromise plasma coagulation. Investigation to determine if clinical enhancement of FXIII activity and/or FI concentration (e.g. fresh-frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate) can attenuate colloid-mediated decreases in hemostasis is warranted."

The studies presented here investigate the relationship between the structure (conformation) and function (activation of hemostasis) of glucosamine-based materials. Several polymer systems were studied, including fibers isolated from a microalgal source containing poly-N-acetyl glucosamine polymers that are organized in a parallel, hydrogen-bonded tertiary structure and can be chemically modified to an antiparallel orientation; and gel formulation derivatives of the microalgal fibers consisting of partially deacetylated (F2 gel) and fully deacetylated (F3 gel) polymers. Comparison of the properties of the poly-N-acetyl glucosamine fiber-derived materials with chitin, chitosan, and commercial chitosan-based products are presented. Several studies were performed with the glucosamine-based materials, including (1) an analysis of the ability of materials to activate platelets and turnover of the intrinsic coagulation cascade, (2) an examination of the viscoelastic properties of mixtures of platelet-rich plasma and the glucosamine-based materials via thromboelastography, and (3) scanning electron microscopic studies to examine the morphology of the glucosamine-based materials. The results presented demonstrate that hemostatic responses to the glucosamine-based materials studied are highly dependent on their chemical nature and tertiary/quaternary structure. The unique natural microalgal fibers were found to have strongly prohemostatic activity compared to the other materials studied."

However, their relative contributions in this population are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of enzymatic and cellular abnormalities in ESRD patients on haemodialysis as assessed by thromboelastography (TEG®). Whole blood samples were analysed by TEG in ESRD patients (n=70) and in a control group (n=70) of subjects with coronary artery disease. Profiles were constructed considering the maximum amplitude (MA), a marker of platelet function, and reaction time (R), a marker of thrombin generation, values. R values were higher in ESRD patients compared with the control group (8.2 ± 2.8 vs. 5.7 ± 1.9 minutes [min], p <0.0001), while there were no differences in MA (66.7 ± 8.1 vs. 66.2 ± 6.6 mm, p=0.562). Normal manufacturer defined coagulation (2-8 min) and aggregation (51-69 mm) parameters were present in 31% of ESRD patients compared with 56% of controls (p=0.006). A hypocoagulable status was observed in 42.9% of ESRD patients compared with 8.9% in the control group (p<0.0001). There were no differences in platelet function, which showed a hyperaggregable status in 41.4% versus 35.7% of cases (p=0.603). Abnormalities in both parameters were observed in 15.7% of ESRD patients versus 1.4% in the control group (p= 0.004), which were more common among older patients (p= 0.005). In conclusion, patients with ESRD have an elevated prevalence of abnormal haemostatic profiles, which may contribute to their elevated risk of bleeding and thrombotic complications."

The stiffness/elasticity and strength of fibrin clots formed with EVICEL and TISSEEL were assessed using applied mechanical force and thromboelastography (TEG). The factor XIII content of the fibrin clots was also evaluated. Mean Young modulus and tensile strength of the fibrin clots produced by EVICEL were significantly higher than those of clots produced by TISSEEL (P < 0.05 for both). The mean time to initial clot formation and mean time to the predefined level of clot formation were numerically shorter for EVICEL compared with TISSEEL. Furthermore, mean maximal amplitude of the clots formed with EVICEL was significantly greater than that for the clots formed with TISSEEL. Mean concentration of factor XIII for the EVICEL fibrinogen samples tested was 9 IU/ml compared with undetectable concentrations of factor XIII for the TISSEEL fibrinogen samples. Fibrin clots formed with EVICEL have a much higher resistance to stretching and tensile strength and are more capable of maintaining their structure against applied force than those formed with TISSEEL. EVICEL also allows more rapid development of fibrin clots than TISSEEL. This superior clot strength and resilience obtained with EVICEL relative to TISSEEL may be due in large part to the presence of factor XIII."

All oral lesions were characterized by a dense and deeply infiltrative lymphoproliferation, showing epitheliotropism and massive eosinophilia. They contained atypical large lymphoid cells, which expressed T-cell markers and CD30. PCR analysis showed a monoclonal rearrangement of the TCR gamma chain gene in all lesions and, in 1 patient, the same rearrangement in the oral and cutaneous specimens. The lesions in these patients seem to be the oral counterpart of the spectrum of primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders and should be recognized as such to avoid a diagnosis of large T-cell lymphoma and possible consequent overtreatment.

We evaluated plasma units collected on six apheresis systems: Dideco Excel, Haemonetics-MCS+, Fresenius-AS-Tech 204, Baxter-Amicus, Gambro BCT COBE Spectra and Gambro BCT-Trima. Collected plasma volumes averaged 300-350 ml for the various systems. Plasma samples were analyzed for platelet (PLT) content (Technicon H3, Bayer) and residual WBC (Imagn 2000). Results are given below. Platelet levels were consistently low for MCS+, COBE Spectra and Trima (all <50 x 10(3) microl(-1)), and were highest with AS204. Residual WBC levels were relatively low in all systems except MCS+. Extremely low levels were observed in Trima plasma. All of the Trima and Spectra units contained <1 x 10(6) WBC per product. With Excel, AS-Tech 204 and Amicus, 1 to 2 units were found to have >1 x 10(6) WBC, while almost all units from MCS+ exceeded this limit. Different levels of plasma purity were obtained with different apheresis systems. The Gambro BCT COBE Spectra and Trima systems were found to achieve consistently low levels of both platelets and WBC."

Twenty patients were entered in the study, all had received mobilising chemotherapy and daily G-CSF (5 microg/kg subcutaneously). The first leucapheresis was performed when the peripheral blood absolute CD34+ cell count was > or = 20 cells/microl. All patients underwent two leucaphereses on consecutive days. The patients were randomised to undergo either the first or second leucapheresis using the COBE Spectra Version 4.7 and then randomised to either the COBE Spectra Version 6 or Haemonetics MCS+ for the other leucapheresis. The target durations of the procedure on the COBE Spectra Version 4.7 and Version 6 were 180 min or two total blood volumes (TBV), and for the Haemonetics MCS+ was 20 cycles with four recirculations. All machines were operated on the 1997 software supplied by the respective manufacturers. The time taken for the procedure was significantly longer with both the Haemonetics MCS+ and the COBE Spectra Version 6 than the COBE Spectra Version 4.7.

CD010438,0,21962085,0,Tethered bilayer lipid membranes on mixed self-assembled monolayers of a novel anchoring thiol: impact of the anchoring thiol density on bilayer formation.,"Tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) are designed on mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of a novel synthetic anchoring thiol, 2,3-di-o-palmitoylglycerol-1-tetraethylene glycol mercaptopropanoic acid ester (TEG-DP), and a new short dilution thiol molecule, tetraethylene glycol mercaptopropanoic acid ester (TEG). tBLM formation was accomplished by self-directed fusion of small unilamellar vesicles of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. The influence of the dilution of the anchoring thiol molecule in the SAM on the vesicle fusion process and on the properties of the resulting tBLMs is studied. It is observed by quartz crystal microbalance that vesicle fusion is a one-step process for a pure TEG-DP SAM as well as for mixed SAMs containing a high concentration of the anchoring thiol. However, upon dilution of the anchoring thiol to moderate concentrations, this process is decelerated and possibly follows a pathway different from that observed on a pure TEG-DP SAM. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is used to qualitatively correlate the composition of the SAM to the electrical properties of the tBLM. In this paper we also delineate the necessity of a critical concentration of this anchoring TEG-DP thiol as a requisite for inducing the fusion of vesicles to form a tBLM."
CD010438,0,11515614,0,Red cell apheresis in autologous preoperative blood donation.,"Preoperative autologous blood donation (PAD) is a commonly used technique for elective surgical procedures with a predictable blood loss. The conventional method is to collect one unit whole blood weekly several times within the shelf-life of red cell concentrates. Erythrapheresis with the Haemonetics cell separator MCS-3p or plus makes it possible to collect two units of red cells in one single session and with this option the time interval and operation can be prolonged to three weeks to improve erythropoiesis. 295 patients, who were scheduled for hip replacement or knee endoprothesis were evaluated retrospectively calculating the net profit of red cells after donating two units of red cells by erythrapheresis. The median net profit of red cells was 140 ml red cells but with a wide range. The patients who profit most of PAD were those with a predonation hct below 42% who had net profits up to 300 ml red cells due to an increased erythropoiesis, which compensate for the withdrawal of the red cells. Thus erythrapheresis with the Haemonetics MCS-3p or Haemonetics MCS plus is recommended for patients with a predonation hct lower than 42% and who can be scheduled for PAD at least 3 weeks before operation when two units of red cells are the target for PAD."

The liposomes were synthesized using the reversed-phase evaporation method and tagged with DNA oligonucleotides by adding cholesteryl-modified DNA reporter probes to the initial lipid mixture. Liposomes were prepared using probe coverages of 0.0013-0.103 mol% of the total lipid input, several hydrophobic and poly(ethylene glycol)-based spacers between the cholesteryl anchor and the probe, and liposome diameters ranging from 200 nm to 335 nm. Their signal enhancement functionality was compared by using them in microtiter plate sandwich-hybridization assays for the detection of single-stranded DNA sequences. In these assays, an optimal reporter probe concentration of 0.103 mol%, a liposome diameter of 274 nm, and a phospholipid concentration of 0.3 mM were found. The length between the cholesteryl anchor and the probe was optimal when a spacer composed of TEG+(CH2O)3 was used. Under optimal conditions, a detection limit of 0.5 nM for a truncated synthetic DNA sequence was found with a coefficient of variation of 4.4%. A 500-fold lower limit of detection using fluorescence was found using lysed dye-encapsulating liposomes versus a single fluorescein-labeled probe. Finally, when this method was applied to the detection of atxA RNA extracted from E.coli SG12036-pIu121 and amplified using NASBA, a minimum extracted concentration of RNA of 1.1x10(-7) microg/microL was found."

We conducted a study of the influence of the new HES specification on coagulation and compared it with another colloidal intravascular volume replacement regimen using gelatin. According to a prospective, random sequence, 42 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery received either HES 130/0.4 (n = 21) or gelatin (n = 21) until the first postoperative day (POD) to keep central venous pressure between 10 and 14 mm Hg. From arterial blood samples, standard coagulation variables were measured, and modified thrombelastogram (TEG) measurements using different activators were performed. A total of 2830 +/- 350 mL of gelatin and 2430 +/- 310 mL of HES 130/0.4 were administered until the morning of the first POD. The use of allogeneic blood/blood products and standard coagulation variables did not differ significantly between the two groups. After induction of anesthesia, all TEG data for both groups were within normal range. Coagulation time and maximum clot firmness did not change significantly in any TEG measurements during the study period. The kinetics of clot formation (clot formation time) significantly increased immediately after surgery, but without showing significant group differences. On the morning of the first POD, the clot formation time returned to almost normal levels, except for aprotinin-activated TEG(R). We conclude that administration of moderate doses of the new HES 130/0.4 preparation in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery results in similar coagulation alterations as those after using an established gelatin-based volume-replacement regimen."

Both 1,2,3-triazole and PEGylated Percec-type dendrons are required in the dendrimer structure for the stabilization of AuNPs upon NaBH(4) reduction of HAuCl(4) in methanol. On the other hand, in the absence of other reductant in water, only PEGylated Percec-type dendrons in dendrimers were found to be indispensable, because of their semicavitand shape, for the spontaneous reduction of HAuCl(4) and stabilization of DSAuNPs."

On admission, 25-35% of trauma patients present with coagulopathy, which is associated with a several-fold increase in morbidity and mortality. The recent introduction of haemostatic control resuscitation along with emerging understanding of acute post-traumatic coagulability, are important means to improve therapy and outcome in exsanguinating trauma patients. This change in therapy has emphasized the urgent need for adequate haemostatic assays to monitor traumatic coagulopathy and guide therapy. Based on the cell-based model of haemostasis, there is emerging consensus that plasma-based routine coagulation tests (RCoT), like prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), are inappropriate for monitoring coagulopathy and guide therapy in trauma. The necessity to analyze whole blood to accurately identify relevant coagulopathies, has led to a revival of the interest in viscoelastic haemostatic assays (VHA) such as Thromboelastography (TEG) and Rotation Thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Clinical studies including about 5000 surgical and/or trauma patients have reported on the benefit of using the VHA as compared to plasma-based assays, to identify coagulopathy and guide therapy. This article reviews the basic principles of VHA, the correlation between the VHA whole blood clot formation in accordance with the cell-based model of haemostasis, the current use of VHA-guided therapy in trauma and massive transfusion (haemostatic control resuscitation), limitations of VHA and future perspectives of this assay in trauma."

Patients were allocated randomly to receive one of the three blood substitutes to obtain moderate intraoperative haemodilution. Blood loss and packed red cell infusion was the same in each group. A greater amount of gelatin was given (1.5 times the measured blood loss) because of its shorter half-life. There was a statistically significant but clinically negligible decrease in platelets count, prothrombin time and fibrinogen, and an increase in bleeding time in all groups. Platelets were slightly but significantly lower after HES. Haemodilution was comparable between groups. TEG showed a state of hypercoagulability in the gelatin group with a significant decrease in r, r + k and an increase in alpha angle."
CD010438,0,8204807,0,"Systemic heparinization during peripheral vascular surgery: thromboelastographic, activated coagulation time, and heparin titration monitoring.","Fifteen patients (9 male, 6 female) undergoing peripheral vascular surgery were monitored during surgery for evidence of subclinical anticoagulation using the activated coagulation time (ACT), thromboelastography (TEG), and heparin titration monitoring. Assessments were made at 30-minute intervals before and after the occlusion clamp. Mean (+/- SD) ACT values preoperatively were 111 (17) seconds, and 10 minutes after 5,000 IU of heparin, the ACT was 264 (57) seconds (P < 0.001). Intraoperatively, there was a significant decline in ACT values at 30 minutes (ACT 228 [50] sec, P < 0.005) and 60 minutes (200 [46] sec, P < 0.001) postheparin. No significant difference in ACT was observed between samples drawn distally and proximally to the clamp. TEG profiles were abolished in all patients immediately following heparinization. However, in 2 patients nearly complete return of the TEG coagulation profile was observed prior to the termination of the procedure and was associated with ACT values less than 160 seconds. The heparin device was unable to accurately monitor heparin elimination at these low doses. Variability of patient response to heparinization necessitates the use of intraoperative monitoring of anticoagulation during peripheral vascular surgery."

Although it is widely accepted that LAO alters platelet function, the effects of LAO on human blood coagulation remain largely unknown. The present study demonstrated, for the first time, that M-LAO, LAO purified from the venom of Agkistrodon halys blomhoffii (Japanese mamushi), possesses an anticoagulant activity. Thrombelastography (TEG) showed that M-LAO significantly delayed the onset and the progress of the coagulation process. In addition, the enzyme prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) dose-dependently, but had little effect on the prothrombin time (PT), suggesting that its principal activity was mediated in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Furthermore, M-LAO reduced factor IX procoagulant activity in a dose-dependent manner and did not affect other coagulation factors. These results indicate that M-LAO has an anticoagulant activity that impairs the intrinsic clotting by inhibiting factor IX."
CD010438,0,17123394,0,Basic aspects of bypassing agents.,"Bypassing agents consist of activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC) and recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa). Their main utilization is for prevention and treatment of bleeding complications, which may occur in inhibitor-developing haemophiliacs, although new indications for rFVIIa (e.g. trauma-related and cerebral bleeds) are now under evaluation in clinical trials. The mechanisms of action for these agents are still not fully understood. The relative complexity of the composition of aPCC suggests the possibility of multiple modes of action for achieving haemostasis. Among those possibilities, the contributions of activated factor X and prothrombin have been demonstrated in recent years both in vitro and in animal models for the only aPCC which remains on the market. rFVIIa also exhibits a complex mode of action, improving coagulation through both tissue factor-dependent and -independent pathways. The various mechanisms that occur at the cellular surfaces, particularly on the outer leaflet of the platelet membrane, primarily contribute to Xase complex formation and thrombin generation. The ways in which these agents affect the complex kinetics of fibrin formation at the site of vascular damage need further clarification, although significant progress has been achieved in the last 10 years. In addition, the ex vivo monitoring that would reflect achievement of haemostasis in vivo is still not standardized, although several attempts using thromboelastography, thrombin generation and the kinetics of fibrin formation have been initiated."

CD010438,0,20958275,0,Use of thromboelastometry in the assessment of coagulation before epidural insertion after massive transfusion.,"A British soldier presented to the UK Field Hospital, Afghanistan with bilateral traumatic lower limb amputations. Resuscitation and surgery followed accepted damage control principles. Blood component therapy was in keeping with UK military guidelines and included platelets and cryoprecipitate. The patient's trachea was extubated following insertion of an effective epidural. Ten days later, in the UK, he developed neurological symptoms and the presence of a subdural haematoma was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging. Conventional laboratory coagulation results in this patient were above accepted limits for epidural insertion; however, thromboelastometry before insertion was suggestive of reduced platelet function. This case highlights the risk of relying solely on platelet count as a marker of platelet function following massive transfusion. Thromboelastometry provides additional information for the assessment of coagulation and should form part of the assessment of coagulation following massive transfusion before epidural insertion."

CD010438,0,8747696,0,Perspectives on thromboelastography.,"The knowledge of these sources of error together with strict methodology assure reliable results and avoid what some authors consider limitations of the test. These so-called limitations are actually due to incomplete information or insufficient experience. It is our opinion that the key for success when using TEG is to use the test in those cases for which it has been indicated. Also, the fact that TEG is a global test of coagulation should be kept in mind and therefore the need for additional hemostatic tests should be evaluated when applicable (Fig.3). According to this review, the established applications of TEG are as follows: (1) detection of hypercoagulable states, particularly in the postoperative period and for patients with malignancies; (2) management of patients who are administered intravenous heparin; (3) monitoring the coagulation state during liver transplantation; (4) monitoring the coagulation state and management of patients during cardiopulmonary bypass; and (5) diagnosis and treatment of hematologic dysfunctions, particularly hemophilia. Management of patients under warfarin administration, as well as monitoring of the adjustment of subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis in several surgical procedures, should probably belong to this list, but further studies are needed to confirm these roles. Used by experienced hands, TEG is a valuable hemostatic test, the future of which is already present."

Herein, we report the case of a patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura who required urgent coronary artery bypass grafting and intra-aortic balloon pump support. Rotational thromboelastometry was used as a point-of-care test of the patient's coagulation status. No preoperative prophylactic transfusion of allogeneic platelets was necessary, and in fact the patient required no allogeneic blood products during his hospitalization. We believe that point-of-care coagulation tests such as thromboelastometry warrant further evaluation regarding their usefulness in the clinical decision of whether to transfuse platelets and other blood products."
CD010438,0,17097417,0,Current options in platelet function testing.,"The variable response to antiplatelet therapy has led to the use of platelet function tests to monitor the effects of antiplatelet drugs in cardiovascular diseases. The goal is to guide antiplatelet therapy to the optimal dose for the prevention or treatment of thrombosis while minimizing hemorrhagic side effects. The bleeding time is no longer recommended for use because of its nonspecificity and lack of clinical correlations. The current de facto ""gold standard"" test of platelet function is turbidometric platelet aggregometry. Although this method has been successful in measuring the aggregation of platelets in a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa (integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3))-dependent manner, it has several limitations, including poor reproducibility, high sample volume, requirement for sample preparation, length of assay time, requirement for a skilled technician, and cost. Therefore, new options for platelet function testing have been developed to address these disadvantages and to meet the need for point-of-care testing that can be performed at or near a patient's bedside without requiring a high degree of technical expertise. The new tests include VerifyNow (Accumetrics, San Diego, CA); Plateletworks (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX); Thrombelastograph PlateletMapping System (Haemoscope Corporation, Niles, IL); Impact cone and plate(let) analyzer (DiaMed, Cressier, Switzerland); and Platelet Function Analyzer 100 (PFA-100; Dade Behring, Newark, DE).

An increased activity of the coagulation factors was observed except of the factors V, IX and XIII. Factor VIII activity in plasma increased slightly during stage II of labour, probably related to stress. Fibrinogen as well as the factors II, VII and X exhibited congruently slight post partum decrease, which can be interpreted as the result of an increased turnover of these factors. Plasminogen levels as well as antiplasmin activity increased; the total fibrinolysis activity was not significantly changed. The increase of fibrin-fibrinogen degradation products, however, indicated the occurrence of discrete fibrinolytic or fibrinogenolytic reactions. The thrombelastograms demonstrated a shift of the balance of pro- and anticoagulatory factors in favour of an increased blood coagulation activity during labour."

CD010438,0,20922353,0,[Management of complex thrombocytopenia with thrombelastometry : a case of simultaneous posttransfusion purpura and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia].,"The case presented describes the combined onset of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia II (HIT) and post-transfusion purpura (PTP) 5-10 days following exposure to heparin and blood transfusion during aortic dissection repair. On day 4 the platelet count decreased by 40% and D-dimers started to increase again. Despite a low clinical probability for HIT-II at this time (4T score of 3) serological testing was done the next day and yielded a negative test result. Following a transient rise after platelet transfusion another 40% decrease in platelet count occurred on day 8. To increase precision of the 4T score, screening ultrasonography was performed and identified a clinically unapparent jugular vein thrombosis. As this increased the 4T score to 6 points, serological testing was repeated and now showed the presence of HIT-II antibodies. Despite switching from heparin to argatroban the platelet count continued to decrease to <5×10(3)/µl. Conventional clotting tests showed a prolonged prothrombin time and severe hypofibrinogenemia. Because of the female sex, age >50 years, history of pregnancy and transfusion 8 days before, PTP was suspected. The alteration of the plasmatic coagulation, however, could not be explained by PTP. Therefore, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and interference of argatroban with conventional clotting tests were considered as alternative diagnoses. In order to differentiate between the two alternatives rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM®) was performed and revealed an increased functional fibrinogen level without signs of hyperfibrinolysis. This argued for an interference of argatroban with the Clauss method of fibrinogen measurement and rendered DIC unlikely. Under suspicion of PTP, treatment with immunoglobulin was initiated and blood transfusions were avoided. Detection of PTP antibodies 1 day later confirmed the combined presence of PTP and HIT-II. As hyperfibrinogenemia compensated for the effects of thrombocytopenia on clot firmness in ROTEM®, anticoagulation with lepirudin was started at 9×10(3) platelets/µl only. The next day the platelet count increased to 32×10(3)/µl and clot firmness returned to normal. No thromboembolic complications and no relevant bleeding were observed. In summary, this case shows for the first time that HIT-II and PTP can occur in parallel in patients with simultaneous exposure to heparin and blood transfusions. Confounding effects of argatroban on conventional clotting tests may mimic DIC under these circumstances and make diagnosis difficult. Careful evaluation of the time-related magnitude in platelet decrease, patient history, course of D-dimers, screening ultrasonography and ROTEM® seem to be helpful to initiate early appropriate therapy before serological test results become available. In contrast to the Clauss method of fibrinogen measurement, assessment of clot firmness in ROTEM® is not influenced by argatroban. Moreover, ROTEM® reveals the compensatory effects of increased functional fibrinogen on clot firmness during severe thrombocytopenia as an important variable for anticoagulation therapy during thrombocytopenia with increased thromboembolic risk."

A two-step procedure of buffy coat isolation followed by Ficoll-diatrizoate separation was used. Buffy-coat cells were isolated primarily either using the COBE 2991 Blood Cell Processor or Haemonetics 30 Cell Separator. All density-gradient separations were performed using the COBE 2991. The nucleated cell recoveries after buffy-coat isolation were 44.3 +/- 10.4% and 85.1 +/- 10.5% (+/- standard deviation, P less than 0.001) for the Haemonetics 30 and COBE 2991 isolated grafts, respectively. The final nucleated cell recoveries after density-gradient separation for these two buffy-coat techniques were 24.2 +/- 10.1% and 29.5 +/- 14.7% (p = 0.30). Compared to manual density-gradient separation, the techniques using the COBE 2991 recovered slightly higher numbers of nucleated cells and CFU-GM. The red blood cell concentration of the 4-HC incubation mixture was 1.0 +/- 0.6% and the CFU-GM survival after treatment was 2.4 +/- 2.6%. The variability in CFU-GM survival after 4-HC incubation of the density-gradient separated grafts appears less than previous experience treating buffy-coat cells. Density-gradient separation of autologous bone marrow appears to provide a more uniform treatment with 4-HC and may improve the clinical transplant course of the autograft recipient."

CD010438,0,21718668,0,Patients with liver cirrhosis suffer from primary haemostatic defects? Fact or fiction?,"Patients with cirrhosis can have abnormalities in laboratory tests reflecting changes in primary haemostasis, including bleeding time, platelet function tests, markers of platelet activation, and platelet count. Such changes have been considered particularly relevant in the bleeding complications that occur in cirrhosis. However, several studies have shown that routine diagnostic tests, such as platelet count, bleeding time, PFA-100, thromboelastography are not clinically useful to stratify bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, treatments used to increase platelet count or to modulate platelet function could potentially do harm. Consequently the optimal management of bleeding complications is still a matter of discussion. Moreover, in the last two decades there has been an increased recognition that not only bleeding but also thrombosis complicates the clinical course of cirrhosis. Thus, we performed a literature search looking at publications studying both qualitative and quantitative aspects of platelet function to verify which primary haemostasis defects occur in cirrhosis. In addition, we evaluated the contribution of qualitative and quantitative aspects of platelet function to the clinical outcome in cirrhosis and their therapeutic management according to the data available in the literature. From the detailed analysis of the literature, it appears clear that primary haemostasis may not be defective in cirrhosis, and a low platelet count should not necessarily be considered as an automatic index of an increased risk of bleeding. Conversely, caution should be observed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia where its correction is advised if bleeding occurs and before invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures."

This study was designed to examine the efficacy of the Haemonetics Cell Saver (CS) during elective aortic reconstructions and identify predictors of clinically significant (> or = 500 cc) and cost-efficient (> or = 1250 cc) salvage volumes. The medical records of all patients undergoing elective infrarenal aortic reconstructions between January 1991 and June 1995 were retrospectively reviewed to determine blood loss, CS return, predictors of clinically significant/ cost-efficient CS returns, blood products transfused, and estimated cost per unit CS return. The CS was used for 138 (82.1%) of all reconstructions during the study period. Estimated blood loss (2127 +/- 1467 vs 1415 +/- 1047) and CS return (927 +/- 790 vs 515 +/- 408) were significantly greater in patients with aneurysms (AAA, N = 63) compared to those with aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD, N = 75). CS returns > or = 500 cc were common (79.4% AAA, 52.0% AIOD) and predictors of > or = 500 cc CS returns were large aneurysms (6.79 +/- 1.84 vs 5.72 +/- 0.71 cm) and male sex (82.0 vs 46.2%) in AAA patients and lower preoperative platelet counts (262 +/- 93 vs 311 +/- 113 K/mm3), concomitant renal revascularizations (20.5 vs 0%), and prolonged operative time (7.9 +/- 2.4 vs 6.9 +/- 2.1 hr) in AIOD patients. In contrast, CS returns > or = 1250 cc were relatively uncommon (28.6% AAA, 5.3% AIOD), and predictors of these CS returns were found only for AAA patients and included any concomitant vascular procedures (38.8 vs 15.6%) and the need for suprarenal aortic clamping (27.8 vs 6.7%). Despite the use of the CS, 73.8% of all patients required allogenic packed red blood cells with a mean of 3.0 +/- 3.1 units transfused in the perioperative period; no difference was seen between AAA and AIOD patients. The calculated cost for a unit of CS return was +128.77 for the AAA patients and +231.91 for the AIOD patients.

CD010438,0,7357249,0,The saline dilution test--a preoperative predictor of DVT.,"In vitro dilution of blood with normal saline produces an increase in coagulability which can be accurately measured by the thrombelastograph. The degree to which the coagulability of an individual patient's blood is increased by such dilution appears to be directly related to that patient's risk of developing a postoperative deep venous thrombosis. In a small group of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, a preoperative test based on the coagulability increase after in vitro saline dilution successfully predicted all those who subsequently developed a postoperative deep venous thrombosis on 125I-fibrinogen scanning."

CD010438,0,2524627,0,New haemocompatible polymers assessed by thrombelastography.,"Mimicry of the nonthrombogenic surface of the erythrocyte has been advocated as the starting point for the development of nonthrombogenic biomaterials. Phosphorylcholine forms 88% of the outer surface of the erythrocyte, and so materials containing it should be nonthrombogenic. We have evaluated the thrombogenicity of such materials and compared them with Dacron and PTFE. Three materials containing phosphorylcholine were used: a naturally occurring phospholipid (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC), a polymerized phospholipid (diacetylenic phosphatidylcholine, DAPC) and a polyester polyurethane (Polyester G). The thrombogenic potential of these materials was assessed by material thrombelastography (MTEG). This technique uses human whole blood at 37 degrees C, without an air interface, and records the elasticity of the blood clot produced. Since each material is evaluated with a control surface, extraneous differences due to factors other than the test material are eliminated. Analysis, and examples of the MTEG traces are shown and discussed. The phosphorylcholine containing materials were found to have a reduced amount of clotting factor activation, but only DPPC was better than Dacron and PTFE. MTEG demonstrated the known thrombogenicity of Dacron towards platelets. A striking reduction in platelet activation was shown for the three phosphorylcholine containing materials. These three materials show only 25% of the platelet activation of PTFE. These materials warrant further investigation as potentially very useful biomaterials."
CD010438,0,22868797,0,Effect of acceleration forces during transport through a pneumatic tube system on ROTEM® analysis.,ROTEM® is considered a helpful point-of-care device to monitor blood coagulation in emergency situations. Centrally performed analysis is desirable but rapid transport of blood samples is an important prerequisite. The effect of acceleration forces on sample transport through a pneumatic tube system on ROTEM® should be tested at each institution to exclude a pre-analytical influence. The aims of the present work were: (i) to investigate the effect of pneumatic tube transport on ROTEM® parameters; (ii) to compare blood sample transport via pneumatic tube vs. manual transportation; and (iii) to determine the effect of acceleration forces on ROTEM® parameters.
CD010438,0,9358079,0,Monitoring platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa-fibrin interaction with tissue factor-activated thromboelastography.,"Computerized thromboelastography (TEG) was used to study platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa function, characterize the consequences of the interaction between polymerizing fibrin and activated platelets, and establish a quantitative assay of platelet function. The ability of platelets to augment the shear elastic modulus of blood clots was measured by TEG under conditions of maximal platelet activation during ex vivo clot formation accelerated by recombinant human tissue factor (TF). Under these conditions, platelets significantly enhance clot strength eightfold (relative to platelet-free fibrin clots). This effect, inhibited by cytochalasin D and c7E3 Fab, appears to be dependent on the transmission of platelet contractile force to fibrin, through glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors. The c7E3 Fab dose response of TF-TEG clot strength is identical to results with platelet aggregation induced by the thrombin receptor agonist peptide (50% inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 3.6 microg/ml); adenosine diphosphate-induced aggregation is easier to inhibit (IC50 = 1.2 microg/ml). The results obtained with this system are reproducible (coefficient of variation for clot strength 4%; intraclass correlation coefficient 0.96). As a clinical assay, TF-triggered computerized TEG is easy to perform at the bedside, provides on-line results within 30 minutes, and may offer advantages over conventional measures of platelet function."
CD010438,0,3044206,0,[Treatment of fulminant falciparum malaria with erythrapheresis].,"Ten days after his return from Cameroon, a twenty-six year old Frenchman, serving on voluntary service overseas, presented with fulminant falciparum malaria: shock, altered consciousness, haemolytic anaemia, threatening disseminated coagulation (platelets less than 150 X 10(-6).l-1; prothrombin time and Stuart factor less than 50%; fibrinogen less than 1.5 g.l-1). In spite of quinine therapy, parasitaemia increased from 4 to 35% within 24 h. Using an Haemonetics V50, the exchange of one and a half red blood cell masses was carried out with 17 red blood cell packs. Calcium gluconate was used to prevent the hypocalcaemia induced by the anticoagulant solution. The patient's platelets and plasma were completely reinjected. The result was very satisfactory. This kind of exchange, well tolerated clinically and biologically, would seem better than the classical exchange transfusion. When 10% of the red blood cells are infected by Plasmodium falciparum, it is necessary to exchange from one and a half to two blood masses. Lesser exchanges are always associated with important relapses and quinine therapy must be carried on during and after the exchange. Restricting this exchange only to red blood cells enabled the patient to benefit from his own coagulation factors, antibodies and platelets, and consequently to reduce the number of blood donors involved. However, metabolites (especially bilirubin and circulating immune complexes) were not eliminated. Partial plasmapheresis may be associated with erythropheresis using human albumin as plasma substitute. This technique needs to be assessed, in order to optimize immediate efficiency and post-transfusion infectious risk."
CD010438,0,18001200,0,Platelet dysfunction in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.,"Coagulopathy is a common phenomenon in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a major contributor to a poor outcome. Thrombocytopenia is a strong negative prognostic factor in TBI, but bleeding tendency can be present even with a normal platelet count. We investigated platelet function in patients with TBI by means of modified thromboelastography (i.e., platelet mapping [TEG-PM]). Four groups were studied: (1) patients with severe isolated TBI (n = 20), (2) patients with general trauma without TBI (the ICU group, n = 10), (3) patients with chronic alcohol abuse (n = 7; as alcohol abuse is common in patients with TBI), and (4) healthy volunteers (n = 10). We measured platelet counts in venous blood (Plt), Ivy bleeding time, standard TEG parameters, and platelet responses to arachidonic acid (AA) and adenosindiphosphate (ADP), using TEG-PM. TBI patients had a lower Plt (180 +/- 68 x 10(9) ; mean +/- SD) and a longer bleeding time (674 +/- 230 sec) than healthy controls, (256 +/- 43 x 10(9), p < 0.01) and (320 +/- 95 sec, p < 0.005), respectively. TBI patients had dramatically lower platelet responses to AA (0-86%, mean 22%) compared to healthy controls (57-89%, mean 73%), the ICU group (4-75%, mean 49%), and the alcohol abusers (17-88%, mean 64%; p < 0.001). Responses to ADP did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients with low responsiveness to AA at admittance to the hospital were likely to develop bleeding complications later. Patients with TBI develop platelet dysfunction, which most likely contributes to bleeding complications. The observed platelet dysfunction appears to involve the cyclooxygenase pathway. TEG-PM analysis can be used to identify patients with a high risk of bleeding complications."

CD010438,0,660699,0,Disseminated intravascular multiple systems activation (DIMSA) following thermal injury.,"Seventy-seven major thermal injury victims were studied with a number of hematologic and immunologic tests initially and sequentially during the first postburn month. The patients were grouped by initial prognostic index as well as by ultimate survival. Pairs were grouped by initial prognostic index as well as by ultimate survival. Pairs of test data from subjects studied at successive time intervals were compared with prognostic index and ultimate survival. Statistically significant changes in coagulation, fibrinolytic, complement, and kinin tests all occurred within these groups. These findings strongly suggest that intravascular contamination occurs following thermal injury in proportion to the extent of the burn, because of the occurrence and persistence of statistically significant multiple system changes. Regrouping all of the blood data according to ultimate death or survival reinforced the concept of intravascular contamination and provided the basis by which one can compute laboratory prognostic indices. The combination of plasminogen, C'3 complement, C'H50, one-minute kinin, and TEG index discriminated between death and survival with 91% accuracy by the end of the first postburn week. These data offer the potential for select blood measurements in refining current prognostic indicators. This may provide an objective data base for the analysis of new treatment programs in thermal injury victims."
CD010438,0,4002308,0,Factors that influence lymphocyte yields in lymphocytapheresis.,"The recent use of lymphocytapheresis to treat immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis prompted a study of factors that influence the cell composition of lymphocytapheresis concentrates. Following single cytapheresis procedures, using protocols recommended by manufacturers, lymphocyte yields were significantly higher with the model 2997 (IBM) and CS-3000 (Fenwal) cell separators as compared to the model 30 (Haemonetics) separator (9.8 +/- 1.1 and 7.1 +/- 1.2 X 10(9) lymphocytes, respectively, versus 4.6 +/- 1.1 X 10(9); p less than 0.01). The lymphocyte concentrate obtained with the CS-3000 separator contained the smallest number of monocytes (0.6 +/- 0.4 X 10(9) versus 1.4 +/- 1.6 and 1 +/- 0.3 X 10(9) for the model 2997 and 30 cell separators, respectively). Platelet contamination of the lymphocyte concentrate was highest with the CS-3000 (6.5 +/- 2.4 X 10(11], and erythrocyte contamination was highest when the model 30 was used (21 +/- 3.0%). Studies using the model 2997 indicated that lymphocyte yields were significantly influenced by donor pre-apheresis absolute lymphocyte counts, and for this cell separator by specific operating variables, such as channel centrifugation speed and positioning of the red cell interface during lymphocyte collection. Maximal yields were obtained when the channel centrifugation speed was 800 to 1000 rpm (equivalent to 100-150 X g) and the red cell interface was adjusted to yield a cell concentrate with a hematocrit less than 4 percent. These results suggest that it will be necessary to standardize lymphocytapheresis collection protocols in future studies to assess the role of lymphocytapheresis in the management of immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis."

Here, we describe a case in which thromboelastometry [rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM)]-guided administration of prothrombin complex concentrate and fibrinogen concentrate was effective in correcting coagulopathy in a 68-year-old man with serious craniofacial trauma and massive haemorrhage. The patient, a cyclist who collided with a car, was transferred to the emergency department of our hospital with signs of shock and significant bleeding from multiple fractures and soft tissue injuries to the face. Blood gas analysis and standard laboratory tests revealed the presence of anaemia and acidosis, and our massive haemorrhage protocol was initiated. E-FAST and total-body computed tomography scans excluded the possibility of bleeding from other sites. All efforts were directed towards stopping bleeding from craniofacial lesions, but the surgeon experienced difficulty in maintaining haemostasis. ROTEM analysis revealed severe coagulopathy and was indispensable in guiding transfusion: 2 g tranexamic acid, followed by 1000 IU prothrombin complex concentrate, 5 g fibrinogen and 2 U platelet concentrate. Two hours later, ROTEM analysis showed that coagulopathy had been corrected, and haemostasis was confirmed by cessation of bleeding. This report highlights the potential for using ROTEM to guide treatment with fibrinogen and prothrombin complex concentrates in the presence of profuse multifocal bleeding and severe coagulopathy."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in platelet reactivity in response to cardiac surgery, both OPCAB and CABG. Platelet reactivity was monitored pre- and postoperatively (days 1 and 4) in elective OPCAB (n = 29) and CABG (n = 24) patients using the maximal amplitude (MA) parameter obtained with thrombelastography. Platelet reactivity was also examined at 1 month in 30 of the 53 patients. Twenty-three percent of the patients (12/53) had a preoperative MA value above normal reference value (MA > 69 mm). By postoperative day 4, 88% of the patients presented with an MA > 69 mm, and significant increases in MA were shown in both groups (p < .0001). Of the 30 patients examined at 1 month after surgery, 75% of the patients with high preoperative MA (6/8) remained at this level. In contrast, only 4.5% of patients with normal preoperative MA (1/22) presented with high MA at day 30. MA has previously been shown to correlate with the incidence of thrombotic and ischemic complications and this study identified 23% of patients needing coronary bypass surgery to be at high risk for recurrent ischemic events at 1 month after surgery, based on the MA. These results suggest that a more aggressive antithrombotic treatment might be warranted for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, both OPCAB and CABG, presenting with a high MA pre- and postsurgery."

CD010438,0,3250634,0,Analysis of thromboelastogram on coagulation and fibrinolysis.,"Hartert's thromboelastography has been used in the diagnosis of abnormal blood clotting for more than 20 years. From a thromboelastogram three parameters are obtained, viz, the reaction time 'r', the rate of formation of fibrin clot 'k', the maximum elasticity of thrombus 'amax'. It is desirable, however, to know the equation that describes the thromboelastogram both in the period in which the complex modulus increases with time because of coagulation, and in the period in which the complex modulus decreases with time because of fibrinolysis. The parameters of the equation could then be used as a diagnostic criterion; yielding information on the mechanism of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Based on our experimental results on human blood in normal and abnormal subjects, we found that the complex modulus of thromboelastograms can be expressed by the sum of two terms, one describing the increase of the complex modulus during coagulation, G1 = G'1 Exp (-tau 1/t), the other describing the decrease of the complex modulus during fibrinolysis, G2 = G'2 Exp (-tau 2/(t-D) when t greater than D. G2 = 0 when t less than D. The compound complex modulus from coagulation to fibrinolysis is G = G1 - G2. Here t is the clotting time, and G'1, G'2, tau 1, tau 2, and D are five constants to be identified. These five constants can be used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes."

When CRP and SAP were similarly evaluated in whole blood using the thromboelastograph (TEG), CRP delayed the onset of coagulation and the initial rate of fibrin formation/polymerization; final clot patency was unaltered. SAP suppressed the anticoagulant activity of heparin in the TEG assay, unlike results obtained in heparinized cell free plasma, by facilitating a more rapid onset of coagulation, increasing the rate of fibrin formation/polymerization, and correcting clot patency.

The purpose of this study was to investigate platelet function changes during a standardized spinal anesthetic and surgery, as well as after a single intraoperative dose of intravenous (IV) ketorolac. The study comprised 30 ASA physical status I patients undergoing spinal anesthesia for knee arthroscopy. Subjects were randomized to receive either ketorolac 60 mg IV 15 min after skin incision or placebo IV. Platelet function testing consisted of an Ivy bleeding time, platelet aggregometry with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen, thromboelastography (TEG), and serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2) assays. Platelet function testing was performed: 1) 15 min prior to the performance of spinal anesthesia; 2) 10 min after surgical skin incision; and 3) 45 min after administration of study drug. The placebo group demonstrated no changes in any platelet function variable during spinal anesthesia and surgery relative to preoperative values. The ketorolac group, however, demonstrated a significant increase in bleeding time from postincision to poststudy drug data points (213 +/- 60s to 275 +/- 85s, mean +/- SD; P < 0.01). Further, platelet aggregometry to collagen was diminished in the ketorolac group from preoperative to poststudy drug data points (90.8% +/- 7.6% to 60.5% +/- 32.5%; P < 0.01). Platelet aggregometry with ADP, however, was unchanged in the ketorolac group. Platelet TxB2 production decreased dramatically in the ketorolac group from preoperative to poststudy drug data points (157.2 +/- 129.4 to 0.3 +/- 0.3 ng/mL; P < 0.01). Platelet function does not appear to be accentuated during spinal anesthesia as it is during general anesthesia. Unlike during general anesthesia, platelet function during spinal anesthesia is impaired, with respect to bleeding time and platelet aggregometry to collagen, by a single intraoperative dose of IV ketorolac."
CD010438,0,2007109,0,Thrombelastography as an aid to regional anesthesia: preliminary communication.,"Thrombelastography (TEG), a less commonly available technique used to assess hemostatic function, has recently gained popularity. Analysis of TEG yields qualitative information about platelet function, thromboplastin generation and their interaction with the intrinsic cascade to form a stable clot. Additional information is obtained about fibrinogen and Factor XIII levels as well as the fibrinolytic system. TEG has been shown to be more sensitive and accurate than traditional coagulation tests at both predicting and treating coagulopathies. We report here three cases in which TEG was used to assess hemostatic function in patients at risk for bleeding prior to the induction of regional anesthesia. In all three cases, traditional tests were inadequate to predict the safe practice of regional anesthesia. TEG provided this information and regional anesthesia was successfully employed."

CD010438,0,19995349,0,Use of rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM) to achieve successful treatment of polytrauma with fibrinogen concentrate and prothrombin complex concentrate.,"Goal-directed coagulation therapy is essential in the management of trauma patients with severe bleeding. Due to the complex nature of coagulation disorders in trauma, a quick and reliable diagnostic tool is essential. We report a severely injured multiple trauma patient who received haemostatic therapy with coagulation factor concentrates, guided by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Initial therapy consisted of fibrinogen concentrate (Haemocomplettan P), as maximum clot firmness in the ROTEM analyses was low, whereas clotting time was normal. Later on, prothrombin complex concentrate was given to optimise thrombin generation. This approach enabled extended emergency hemihepatectomy to be performed without using fresh frozen plasma. As the EXTEM maximum clot firmness showed good clot quality, no platelets were transfused despite low platelet counts. This case shows the potential success of treatment using both fibrinogen concentrate and prothrombin complex concentrate, not only in restoring haemostasis but also in minimising requirement for transfusion of allogeneic blood products."

In the present ex vivo study we investigated the influence of fibrinogen and rFVIIa, alone or in combination, on whole blood coagulation thromboelastometry using pre- and postoperative blood samples from 18 consecutive adult patients undergoing CPB surgery. Dynamic thromboelastometric clotting profiles were recorded using citrated whole blood activated with trace amounts of tissue factor (Innovin, final dilution 1:17000). Blood samples were collected before surgery (control) and postoperative samples were obtained following in vivo neutralization of heparin with protamine sulphate. All blood samples were treated with heparinase to ensure neutralization of possible residual heparin effect. The post-operative blood samples were spiked with buffer, rFVIIa (2 microg/mL), fibrinogen (1 mg/mL), or the combination of rFVIIa and fibrinogen. Despite neutralization of heparin, CPB surgery left a measurable coagulopathy that was thromboelastometrically characterized by prolonged onset of clotting, reduced maximum velocity of clot formation (MaxVel), and decreased maximum clot firmness (MCF). Ex vivo spiking of the postoperative samples with rFVIIa shortened the clotting time. Fibrinogen also shortened the clotting time and, in addition, improved the MaxVel, and MCF. Finally, adding the combination of rFVIIa and fibrinogen to the postoperative samples corrected all thromboelastometric parameters to the preoperative range. In conclusion, the correction of whole blood clotting abnormalities that occurs with rFVIIa and/or fibrinogen suggests that future clinical trials on treatment of bleeding during CPB surgery should study the haemostatic effect of fibrinogen or possibly the combination of rFVIIa and fibrinogen."

CD010438,0,20214450,0,Beyond cell capture: antibody conjugation improves hemocompatibility for vascular tissue engineering applications.,"Antibody-conjugated surfaces are being studied for cardiovascular implant applications to capture endothelial progenitor cells and promote endothelialization. However, despite the large amount of literature on endothelial progenitor cell capture efficiency, little effort has been made to understand acute blood responses to the modified surfaces. We hypothesize that CD34 antibody conjugation passivates surfaces against procoagulatory events, and thus improves hemocompatibility. To test this hypothesis, we subjected the modified films to hemocompatibility tests to evaluate contact activation, platelet adhesion and activation, as well as whole blood clotting response to the films. Here, we demonstrate the alteration of blood responses due to polyacrylic acid (PAAc) engraftment and subsequent antibody conjugation on biaxially stretched polycaprolactone (PCL) films. Compared to PCL, PAAc-engrafted PCL (PCL-PAAc) and CD34-antibody-conjugated films (PCL-PAAC-CD34) resulted in a four- to ninefold (p < 0.001) reduced platelet activation. PCL-PAAc, however, resulted in an increased contact activation on thromboelastography, and a poorer blood compatibility index assay (43.4% +/- 2.3% vs. 60.9% +/- 2.5%, p < 0.05). PCL-PAAC-CD34, on the other hand, resulted in delayed clot formation (r = 19.3 +/- 1.5, k = 6.8 +/- 0.6 min) and reduced platelet adhesion and activation, and yielded the highest blood compatibility index score, indicating least thrombogenicity (69.3% +/- 3.2%).

Aspirin inhibits the platelet-endothelial interaction that is part of the coagulation process. We investigated the role of aspirin in the phenomenon of haemodilution-induced coagulability to identify if the platelet-endothelial system is involved in the process. Previous work showed that the TEG is not altered by oral ingestion of aspirin. Blood from 20 volunteers was divided into two aliquots of 4 ml each. One sample was diluted by 20% by addition of 0.9% saline 1 ml while the other was not diluted and served as a control. Coagulation studies were performed using the TEG and enhanced coagulation was seen in the saline diluted samples. Subjects then received soluble aspirin 375 mg daily for 3 days, after which the tests were repeated. There was no difference in the control TEG values and saline enhancement of coagulation was preserved in all subjects after 3 days of aspirin administration. We conclude that aspirin had no effect on the observation that haemodilution with saline enhances the coagulability of whole blood."

However, cells passaged using EDTA, without trypsin, acquired an isochromosome p7 in three replicates of one experiment. In all of the TEG, collagenase and EDTA-treated cultures, cells retained consistent telomere length and potentiality, demonstrating that single cell dissociation can be used to maintain karyotypically and phenotypically normal hESCs. However, competitive genomic hybridization revealed that subkaryotypic deletions and amplifications could accumulate over time, reinforcing that present culture regimes remain suboptimal.

CD010438,0,18950467,0,Differential clot stabilising effects of rFVIIa and rFXIII-A2 in whole blood from thrombocytopenic patients and healthy volunteers.,"The haemostatic effect of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa;NovoSeven) in thrombocytopenic patients has been a matter of controversy. Haemostasis by rFVIIa occurs via FVIIa-mediated thrombin generation in a platelet-dependent manner and may therefore be suboptimal in patients without functional platelets. Under such conditions, a clot-stabilizing agent, such as factor XIII (FXIII), may supplement the effect ofrFVIIa and improve haemostasis. Recombinant factor XIII (rFXIII-A2) is produced as an A2 homodimer of the FXIII A subunit and is equivalent to cellular FXIII normally found in platelets. The combined effects of rFVIIa andrFXIII-A2 were evaluated in clot lysis assays using factor XIII-deficient plasma and by whole blood thrombelastography (TEG) analysis from normal donors and thrombocytopenic stem cell transplantation patients. Clotting time was shortened by rFVIIa (0.6-10 microg/ml). rFVIIa only modestly improved anti-fibrinolysis,whereas rFXIII-A2 (0-20 microg/ml) enhanced anti-fibrinolysis without effect on clotting time. TEG analysis showed rFVIIa shortened the clotting time, and enhanced clot development, maximal mechanical strength and resistance to fibrinolysis, whereas, rFXIII-A2 enhanced clot development,maximal mechanical strength and markedly enhanced resistance to fibrinolysis. These data illustrate that rFVIIa and rFXIII-A2 contribute to clot formation and stability by different mechanisms suggesting enhanced haemostatic efficacy by combining these agents."

However, higher hypercoagulation evidenced by significantly raised prothrombin formation and clot elasticity together with higher levels of D-dimer, uPA antigen and PAI-1 than observed in normal pregnancy suggests a hyperfibrinolytic/inhibitor state in hydrops fetalis pregnancy associated with bad obstetric outcome. In IUGR pregnancy associated with good outcome further enhanced clot elasticity was seen whilst no significant differences were observed in pregnancy with chromosomal anomalies when compared to uncomplicated normal pregnancy. Our study suggests that in hydrops fetalis pregnancy, further enhanced prothrombin formation and hyperfibrinolysis/inhibitor at late mid-trimester is associated with a poor obstetric outcome."

In the first part of the study we compared different testing modalities (thrombelastography (TEG), platelet aggregometry, and whole blood aggregation) to assess platelet ADP receptor inhibition. Because clopidogrel is a pro-drug, we used an in vitro model of ADP inhibition with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA). FSBA at final concentration of 80 microM completely inhibited platelet aggregation but had no effect on TEG maximum amplitude (MA). In the second part of the study, antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel were clinically assessed and correlated to postoperative bleeding in 18 coronary bypass surgery patients. Preoperative TEG results were normal or hypercoagulable in clopidogrel-treated patients, although platelet aggregation responses to ADP were inhibited. Clopidogrel-treated patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass had a high incidence (84.6%) of platelet transfusion therapy due to increased chest tube drainage. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that normal preoperative TEG-MA does not preclude clopidogrel-induced ADP receptor blockade; however, TEG can be a reliable monitor for CPB-induced platelet dysfunction related to GPIIb/IIIa. For monitoring clopidogrel, it is necessary to perform more specific platelet function tests (aggregometry or platelet count ratio) using ADP as an activator."

CD010438,0,10825314,0,Rapid evaluation of coagulopathies after cardiopulmonary bypass in children using modified thromboelastography.,"Complex coagulopathies follow cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in children. However, objective laboratory data that can be acquired rapidly to guide their management are lacking. Because thromboelastography has proven useful in this regard, we evaluated the use of celite or tissue factor (TF) activation and heparinase modification of blood samples to allow rapid determination of thromboelastogram data in children younger than 2 yr undergoing CPB. Celite or TF activation shortened the initiation of clotting and, thus, the time required for the important thromboelastogram alpha and maximum amplitude values to begin evolving. Although thromboelastogram alpha and maximum amplitude values were increased with these activators, correlations persisted between platelet count or fibrinogen level and each of these values. The additional use of heparinase allowed thromboelastograms to be obtained during CPB with values not different from those obtained without heparinase after protamine administration. Therefore, celite- or TF-activated, heparinase-modified thromboelastograms begun during CPB allow objective data to be available by the conclusion of protamine administration to help restore hemostasis after CPB in children. Thromboelastography identified transient fibrinolysis during CPB in some children that resolved by the conclusion of protamine administration. Future investigations of the effectiveness of modified thromboelastography-guided coagulopathy management after CPB in children are needed."
CD010438,0,6613270,0,[Intraoperative autotransfusion in extensive orthopedic interventions].,"In large orthopaedic operations massive blood losses sometimes can hardly be avoided. Apart from other autotransfusion methods (repeated preoperative withdrawal of blood or isovolaemic haemodilution) the intraoperative autotransfusion (IAT) has proved particularly useful. By means of the autotransfusion system Haemonetics Cell Saver, whose functional performance is described in the following, there was a decrease in homologous erythrocytes of 60.5 l, that is more than 300 erythrocyte concentrates. With regard to the intraoperative period the average reduction in donor blood for each patient was between 68.0 and 94.8%. Considering the compensation of postoperative blood losses there was a decrease in donor blood of between 55.6 and 66.2%. The importance of this reduction in donor blood (decreased hepatitis risk and better quality of the autologous erythrocytes) is discussed. On close and critical examination of advantages and disadvantages concerning the intraoperative autotransfusion, we have to give the preference to the Haemonetics Cell Saver, especially in the orthopaedic range."

CD010438,0,8985070,0,Autotransfusion utilization in abdominal trauma.,"The purpose of this review is to investigate the utility of autotransfusion in trauma patients in the past 3 years. A retrospective review was conducted of the charts for whom the Haemonetics Cell Saver autotransfusion device (Haemonetics Corp., Natick, MA) was utilized between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 1995. The estimated blood loss and quantity of blood transfused were noted for abdominal trauma patients. Costs of autotransfusion were then compared to estimated blood bank costs for this group. The Haemonetics Cell Saver autotransfusion device was requested for 592 cases from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 1995. Nonorthopedic trauma cases comprised 25 per cent of all autotransfusion cases. One hundred twenty-six patients had isolated abdominal trauma and had a mean estimated blood loss of 4864 +/- 6070 cc. The average volume of intraoperatively salvaged autologous blood transfused (autotransfusion) per patient was 1547 +/- 2359 cc, or a bank blood equivalent of 6.9 units of packed red blood cells. The total cost of autotransfusion in these patients was $63,252.00. Had bank blood been used instead of salvaged autologous blood, the cost would have been $114,523.00; thus, autotransfusion resulted in a savings of $51,271.00. The use of salvaged autologous blood comprised 45 per cent of total blood transfused. On a case-by-case basis, 75 per cent of cases were cost-effective compared to blood bank costs for an equivalent transfusion. Transfusion of intraoperatively salvaged autologous blood (autotransfusion) is a cost-effective, efficient way to provide blood products to operative trauma patients."

After thawing and deglycerolization the RBC should have a residual glycerol concentration of about 1%. We conducted three studies to measure the supernatant osmolality and supernatant refraction in RBC frozen with 40% w/v glycerol and stored at -80 degrees C for as long as 16 years. The measurements were made before and after deglycerolization.

CD010438,0,1813694,0,Hemostatic studies of ex situ hepatic surgery.,"Ex situ hepatic surgery, in which a diseased liver is resected from outside the body, was first reported in 1988. This study investigates the hemostatic changes occurring during such surgery in two cases. During the anhepatic period of more than 5 hours, veno-venous bypass without heparin was performed. The tests included platelet count, prothrombin activity (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen (Fbg), factor II (F.II), factor V (F.V), and thromboelastography (TEG). Three to 4 hours after entering the anhepatic phase, marked fibrinolysis and a fall in the values of PT, Fbg and F.V. were observed. Every parameter temporarily deteriorated immediately after revascularization of the graft, however, all returned to almost normal values within 1-2 hours after hepatic reperfusion except for F.V and platelets. In conclusion, the coagulopathy during ex situ hepatic surgery is caused by the marked fibrinolysis and depletion of hemostatic factors which develop 3-4 hours after the onset of the anhepatic phase."

CD010438,0,15183043,0,A critical role for thrombin in platelet aggregation under high shear stress.,"The serine protease, thrombin, plays a crucial role in both coagulation and platelet activation. Anhydrothrombin (AhT) is a catalytically inactive derivative of thrombin in which dehydroalanine replaces the active-site serine. AhT retains affinity for natural substrates of thrombin and may be a competitive inhibitor of thrombin-mediated coagulation and platelet reactions. In the present study, thrombelastography showed that AhT not only delayed the onset and the progress of the coagulation process but impaired clot strength, indicating that AhT may have both anticoagulant and antiplatelet activity. In addition, AhT prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time dose-dependently, but had little effect on the prothrombin time, suggesting that its principal activity was mediated in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. AhT inhibited thrombin-induced aggregation of platelet-rich plasma. Complete inhibition of aggregation was evident at a concentration of 1.85 microM AhT. Furthermore, 3.7 microM of AhT almost completely abolished shear-induced platelet aggregation in PRP. Interpretation of this in vitro study requires confirmation in vivo, but the findings suggest that thrombin plays a critical role in shear related platelet mechanisms. AhT may be a useful tool for investigating platelet-based coagulation reactions and may provide the basis for a novel class of antithrombotic agents."
CD010438,0,20731638,0,The effect of low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) on enhanced coagulation induced by crystalloid haemodilution.,"The purpose of this study was to establish whether a low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) attenuated or abolished the enhanced coagulation induced by crystalloid fluid therapy. Twenty young, healthy male volunteers were injected subcutaneously with either enoxaparin 40 mg or saline on two separate occasions one week apart, in a randomised, blinded study. Twelve hours later, a blood sample was taken for thrombelastography analysis and haematocrit. Saline 14 ml.kg⁻¹ was then infused over thirty minutes and thrombelastography and haematocrit measurements repeated. There was a significant post-dilutional difference in the alpha angle (p = 0.002) and k-time (p = 0.001) between the two groups. There was a trend towards reduced shortening of r-time in the enoxaparin group compared to the saline control (p = 0.18). The findings suggest that enoxaparin diminished acceleration of clot formation due to haemodilution."
CD010438,0,12015682,0,[Thrombelastographic coagulation analysis following in vitro and in vivo haemodilution with hydroxyethyl starch (HES)].,"In the study presented the effects of in vitro hemodilution with HES on coagulation are compared with the effects of in vivo hemodilution using thrombelastography (TEG). The in vivo hemodilution was performed by the i. v. infusion of 1000 ml 6 % solution of hydroxyethyl starch HES (2 formulations with HES 130/0.4 and one formulation with HES 200/0.5) in healthy volunteers during 30 min. The in vitro hemodilution was performed with blood samples taken from the volunteers before the infusion was started. These samples were diluted with HES-solution until the same hemoglobin concentration measured at the end of the infusion was attained. The in vivo TEG-parameters remained in the reference range of the method, however all in vitro TEG-parameters are out of the range of normal values. The isolated interpretation of the in vitro data shows an impairment of blood coagulation. The shortening of the reaction time as an indicator for the initiation of blood clotting points to activated coagulation by in vivo hemodilution with HES, whereas in vitro the prolongation of the reaction time is indicative for retardation of clotting. The evaluation of the TEG-parameters and of other clotting parameters determined prior to the beginning of the infusion, at the end of the infusion and four hours after termination of the infusion of HES 130/0.4 and of HES 200/0.5 to healthy volunteers show alterations of blood coagulation parameters caused mainly by dilutional effects. The more pronounced alterations found in vitro cannot be interpreted as impairment of haemostasis in vivo. On the other hand, the likewise haemodilution in vitro causes an impairment of coagulation. Therefore, the effects of in vitro hemodilution with HES on coagulation differ qualitatively and quantitatively from the effects of in vivo hemodilution."
CD010438,0,9620500,0,Conjugated estrogen reduces transfusion and coagulation factor requirements in orthotopic liver transplantation.,"We conducted a prospective, randomized study to determine the efficacy of conjugated estrogen in reducing blood product transfusion during orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Patients undergoing OLT were included in the study. Only those having a reaction time of more than 30 mm or 15 min (19 -28 mm) on computed thromboelastography (CTEG) at the beginning of surgery were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized to receive either conjugated estrogen (CE) or placebo. Every patient received a first dose of CE (100 mg i.v.) (20 mL) or placebo (20 mL of isotonic sodium chloride solution) at the beginning of the procedure and a second dose of CE (100 mg i.v.) or 20 mL of placebo (20 mL of isotonic sodium chloride solution) just after reperfusion of the new graft. The two groups were similar in age, weight, requirement for veno-veno bypass, time on veno-veno bypass, CTEG measurement, and preoperative hemoglobin and platelet values. Blood products were given in relation to hematocrit and coagulation (CTEG) variables, which were measured every hour during the surgery. The amount of transfused blood products did not differ in terms of units of cryoprecipitate, but the intraoperative requirements for red blood cells (6 +/- 3 vs 9 +/- 6 U; P = 0.05), platelets (12 +/- 8 U vs 18 +/- 10 U; P = 0.05) and fresh-frozen plasma (3 +/- 3 U vs 6 +/- 4 U; P = 0.001) was significantly less in the estrogen group than in the control group. We conclude that CE is associated with a significant decrease in use of fresh-frozen plasma, platelets, and red blood cells during OLT."

Many in vitro studies in which blood is exposed to contrast media suggest that nonionic contrast medium (NICM) has a weaker anticoagulant effect than ionic contrast medium (ICM) and some studies suggest that NICM can lead to activation of coagulation thus increasing the risk of thrombotic events where it is employed. We have looked at the changes in coagulation adjacent to the site of contrast injection/potential angioplasty to determine the magnitude of change locally.

Blood was obtained from 11 healthy male volunteers before and 2.5 h after oral administration of 10 mg rivaroxaban. In addition to standard coagulation tests clot formation was measured by ROTEM™ analyzing extrinsic (Extem) and intrinsic thrombelastometry (Intem). Significant differences to the baseline values were found in the Extem clotting time (Extem-CT, 58 ± 9 s and 87 ± 17 s, p < 0.01), Intem-CT (194 ± 26 s and 239 ± 43 s; p = 0.02), prothrombin time (PT, 86 ± 9% and 67 ± 7%; p < 0.01) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT, 28 ± 1 s and 35 ± 2 s; p < 0.01). There was a low correlation between Extem-CT and PT as well as between Intem-CT and aPTT before and after rivaroxaban intake. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis determined aPTT to be the most appropriate parameter for the prediction of rivaroxaban-induced anticoagulation, Intem-CT and Extem-CT proved to be moderate tests and PT had no significance in the prediction of rivaroxaban-induced anticoagulation. Of utmost clinical importance was the fact that rivaroxaban treated patients could still show normal ROTEM™ values. Thus, ROTEM™ cannot be a suitable test method to exclude inhibition of blood coagulation by rivaroxaban."
CD010438,0,20413127,0,Synthesis and characterization of calcite and aragonite in polyol liquids: control over structure and morphology.,"An innovative precipitation process, achieved through the thermal decomposition of urea in polyols containing hydrated calcium salts, was used to prepare calcite and aragonite at elevated temperatures (120-180 degrees C). The effect of various experimental conditions, such as the media of different polyols (ethylene glycol, EG; diethylene glycol, DEG; and tetraethylene glycol, TEG), the temperature, the reaction time, and the addition of magnesium salts, on the structure, size, and morphology of the obtained solids is described. It was found that the formation of calcium carbonate polymorphs, i.e., calcite or aragonite, their morphology and their size was predominantly influenced by the type of polyols used, and by the diverse growing mechanisms occurring in the different polyol systems. Structurally and morphologically different calcite precipitates were formed in the DEG and TEG solvents via classical crystallization processes, while colloidal and nanostructured aragonite particles were assembled in the EG through a recently reaffirmed mechanism based on the role of nanoscale aggregation processes in the formation of carbonate solids. This study highlights the importance of the presence and concentration of magnesium ions in the inhibition of the crystal growth of nanosized aragonite, and in the stabilization of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) precipitates in polyol solutions."

We retrospectively reviewed the preoperative Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, baseline coagulation laboratory results, and intraoperative transfusion of red blood cells and component therapy for 27 living donation transplants and 69 cadaveric donation transplants during a 3-yr period (2001-2004). Patients undergoing living donation transplantation had significantly lower MELD scores and preserved coagulation function compared with cadaveric donation transplantation recipients (P < 0.001). The living donation transplant patients also received significantly fewer transfusions of red blood cells and component therapy compared with the cadaveric donation transplant patients (P < 0.001). For the combined population of both cadaveric donation transplant and living donation transplant patients, there were significant associations between MELD score and preoperative coagulation tests (P < 0.001) and intraoperative transfusion of blood and component therapy. MELD score and preoperative fibrinogen concentration were identified as independent predictors of transfusion exposure. In conclusion, we detected significant differences in severity of disease at time of transplantation, degree of impairment of coagulation function, and need for transfusion of red blood cells and component therapy between patients undergoing living donation transplantation compared with patients undergoing cadaveric donation transplantation."
CD010438,0,7517108,0,[Monitoring of hemostasis during liver transplantation: contribution of thromboelastography].,"Monitoring of coagulation is mandatory during liver transplantation (LT). Standard coagulation tests may be routinely used. However, they give static information and may be inadequate in case of severe coagulation defect. Interest has been recently focused on thromboelastography (TEG) which could give more suitable and rapid information in these cases. Few studies have evaluated the clinical interest of TEG compared to conventional tests. This comparison was the aim of the present study, performed in 89 patients scheduled for LT. The anaesthetic management as well as procedure of transfusion were similar in all patients. Before unclamping, 5000 KIU.kg-1 of aprotinin were injected. Routine tests and TEG were performed at the beginning and end of both pre-anhepatic and anhepatic phases, and 5, 30, 60, and 120 min after the revascularisation of the new liver. A phase of hypocoagulability was observed after unclamping. Biological signs included an increase in activated thromboplastin time, a reduction of alpha angle and maximum amplitude on TEG with a lengthening of its r + k component. A strong correlation existed between maximum amplitude and platelets, maximum amplitude and fibrinogen, alpha and fibrinogen at each time of the surgical procedure. Euglobulin lysis time decreased significantly after clamping, whereas fibrin degradation products increased at the same time. However, typical fibrinolysis with a clot lysis index (CLI) below 55% was only observed in 15 patients. Twelve of them had a CLI value reaching 0%, associated with severe generalized oozing. Aprotinin (200,000 to 600,000 KIU) corrected these abnormalities. These results show that TEG may not be very helpful to determine whether platelets or fibrinogen are involved in the phase of hypocoagulability detected after unclamping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010438,0,19581801,0,Thromboelastometry in patients with severe sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation.,"Severe sepsis induces coagulopathy, which may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Thromboelastometry is a point-of-care whole blood coagulation monitor, which has been validated in human endotoxemia model. We assessed thromboelastometry in severe sepsis and overt DIC and investigated its applicability in differentiating sepsis-related coagulation disturbances. Thromboelastometry (EXTEM and FIBTEM tests) and traditional coagulation assays were analyzed in 28 patients with severe sepsis, 12 of who fulfilled the criteria of overt DIC on admission. Ten healthy persons served as controls. Coagulation parameters, clotting time, clot formation time (CFT), alpha angle, maximal clot firmness (MCF) and lysis index at 60 min, were registered. In patients with overt DIC, EXTEM MCF, CFT and alpha angle differed from that in both healthy controls and patients without DIC, indicating hypocoagulation (MCF 52, 63 and 68 mm; CFT 184, 88 and 73 s; and alpha angle 58, 72 and 76 degrees , respectively, P < 0.01 for all). In patients without DIC, the trend was toward hypercoagulation in EXTEM and FIBTEM MCF (68 vs. 63 mm, P = 0.042 and 23 vs. 15 mm, P = 0.034, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that MCF, CFT and alpha angle discriminated patients with overt DIC moderately (area under curve 0.891, 0.815 and 0.828, respectively, P < 0.001 for all). Traditional coagulation assays showed progressively worsening coagulopathy from controls to septic patients without DIC and further to those with overt DIC. We conclude that thromboelastometry may be a valuable tool in assessing whole blood coagulation capacity in patients with severe sepsis with and without overt DIC."
CD010438,0,9249100,0,Continuous small-dose tranexamic acid reduces fibrinolysis but not transfusion requirements during orthotopic liver transplantation.,"Tranexamic acid (TA) is a synthetic drug that inhibits fibrinolysis. It has been administered to decrease the use of blood products during cardiac surgery and orthotopic liver transplantation when infused in larger doses. A small-dose infusion of aprotinin causes a reduction in fibrinolysis and blood product requirement during orthotopic liver transplantation without apparent risk of intravascular thrombosis. This prospective study was designed to investigate whether a small-dose infusion of TA would be equally effective in reducing fibrinolysis and blood product transfusions during orthotopic liver transplantation. A double-blind, controlled study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of a small-dose TA infusion with that of a placebo. Thirty-two consecutive patients were randomized either to the TA group (n = 16), which received an intravenous infusion of 2 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1), or to the control group (n = 16), which received an identical volume of normal saline. Coagulation values were measured, a field rating was made by the surgeon, and a thromboelastogram was produced at four predetermined intervals throughout the case-before TA infusion was started, after portal vein ligation, 10 min after reperfusion, and at the end of surgery. Intraoperative transfusion requirements were recorded during the procedure and for the first 24 h postoperatively. A record was kept of any intraoperative epsilon-aminocaproic acid administered for uncontrolled fibrinolysis. The thromboelastogram clot lysis index was significant for lysis in the control group during both the anhepatic and the neohepatic phases (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) when compared with the TA group. Fibrin degradation products were significantly increased (>20 microg/mL) in the control group at reperfusion (P < 0.03) and at the end of surgery (P < 0.01). D-dimers were also significantly increased (>1 mg/L) in the control group at the end of surgery (P < 0.04). Nine of the 16 control patients versus 3 of the 16 TA patients required epsilon-aminocaproic acid rescue for fibrinolysis. There were no other significant differences between groups. Transfusion requirements during surgery and for the first 24 h postoperatively did not differ significantly between the two groups. We conclude that the use of small-dose TA reduces fibrinolysis but not transfusion requirements during orthotopic liver transplantation."

We hypothesized that potential differences in procoagulant and fibrinolytic actions of aPCC and rFVIIa may lie in the clot stability against fibrinolytic activation. We used thrombin generation, fluorescence detection and thromboelastometry in anti-factor IXa (FIXa) aptamer-treated whole blood (WB) and plasma to evaluate: (i) generation of thrombin and activated factor X (FXa) and (ii) viscoelastic properties of blood clots in the presence of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) after addition of aPCC (0.4 U mL(-1)) or rFVIIa (60 nm). Peak thrombin generation increased from 85 +/- 19 nm in aptamer-treated plasma to 276 +/- 83 nm and 119 +/- 22 nm after addition of aPCC and rFVIIa respectively (P < 0.001). FXa activity increased within 20 min by 87 +/- 6% and by 660 +/- 97% after addition of aPCC and rFVIIa respectively (P < 0.001). TPA-induced lysis time increased from 458 +/- 378 s in aptamer-treated WB to 1597 +/- 366 s (P = 0.001) and 1132 +/- 214 s (P = 0.075), after addition of aPCC and rFVIIa respectively. In this haemophilia model using the anti-FIXa aptamer, the larger amount of thrombin was generated with aPCC compared with rFVIIa, while FXa generation was more rapidly increased in the presence of rFVIIa. Furthermore, clot formation in anti-FIXa aptamer-treated WB was less susceptible to tPA-induced fibrinolysis after adding aPCC compared with rFVIIa."
CD010438,0,21111429,0,"Nanostructuring of CyPLOS (Cyclic Phosphate-Linked OligoSaccharides), novel saccharide-based synthetic ion transporters.","Ionophores are an important class of synthetic molecules which mimic natural ion channels or carriers. Here we report the aggregation behavior in pseudo-physiological environment of three Cyclic Phosphate-Linked Oligosaccharides (CyPLOS) derivatives, synthetic ion transporters based on cyclic, phosphate-linked disaccharide skeleton differing for the nature of the tails (tetraethylene-TEG glycol and/or n-undecyl chains) attached to the C-2 and C-3 of the constitutive monosaccharides. Their aggregation behavior has been studied by a combined use of dynamic light scattering (DLS), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) and Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS). DLS measurements were performed to reveal the formation and size distribution of the CyPLOS aggregates. EPR measurements, by using 5-doxyl stearic acid (5-DSA) as spin-probe, showed that the aggregates are mainly due to the formation of double layers and allowed to analyze the local fluidity. Finally, SANS measurements allowed estimating the layer thickness of the double layers. Our results indicate that the three CyPLOS analogs show self-aggregation properties that depend on the different nature of the inserted tails."
CD010438,0,22578369,0,Plasma transfusion for patients with severe hemorrhage: what is the evidence?,"The following review will detail the current knowledge in massive hemorrhage with regard to the pathophysiology of the coagulation disturbance, the role of plasma, the role of alternatives to plasma, and the clinical value of having a massive transfusion protocol. The coagulation disturbance in trauma patients is more than just the result of consumption of clotting factors at sites of injury and dilution from the infusion of intravenous fluids and red blood cells (RBCs). Even before substantial amounts of fluid resuscitation and RBC transfusion, one-quarter of trauma patients already have abnormal coagulation variables. There is an apparent role for the activation of protein C, hypofibrinogenemia, and fibrin(gen)olysis in the coagulation disturbance after trauma and massive hemorrhage. None of these three disturbances would be completely mitigated by the use of plasma alone, suggesting that there may be an opportunity to improve care of these patients with alternative strategies, such as fibrinogen concentrates and antifibrinolytics. Despite numerous retrospective cohort studies evaluating 1:1 plasma to RBC formula-driven resuscitation, the overall clinical value of this approach is unclear. Studies have even raised concerns regarding a potential increase in morbidity associated with this approach, particularly for patients overtriaged to 1:1 where a massive transfusion is unlikely. We also do not have sufficient evidence to recommend either goal-directed therapy with thromboelastography or early use of fibrinogen replacement, with either cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrates. We have high-quality data that argue against the role for recombinant Factor VIIa that should prompt removal of this strategy from existing protocols. In contrast, we have high-level evidence that all bleeding trauma patients should receive tranexamic acid as soon as possible after injury. This therapy must be included in hemorrhage protocols. If we are to improve the care of massively bleeding patients on a firm scientific ground, we will need large-scale randomized trials to delineate the role of coagulation replacement and the utility of laboratory monitoring. But even until these trials are completed, it is clear that a massive transfusion protocol is needed in all hospitals that manage bleeding patients, to ensure a prompt and coordinated response to hemorrhage."

The anticoagulant action was investigated in common test assays such as thrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and thrombelastography. In human plasma 1 caused a concentration-dependent prolongation of coagulation times and influenced the recalcification measured by thrombelastographic recording. In different models of experimental thrombosis in rats the antithrombotic effectiveness of 1 was shown. I.v. infusion of the thrombin inhibitor reduced or prevented the formation of stasis-induced venous thrombi and of arterial thrombi after electrically induced damage of the vessel wall as well as prolonged the time of a thrombotic occlusion of an extracorporeal arterio-venous shunt. At low doses 1 was also effective in thrombin-induced microthrombosis."

In the first 14 patients (phase 1), biochemical, hematologic, coagulation, and semiquantitative bacteriologic studies were performed from the collected blood, processed blood, and patients' blood before and after 500 mL of autotransfusion. The acid-citrate-dextrose solution produced adequate anticoagulation, and the system effectively removed most of the potassium, red blood cell fragments, plasma free hemoglobin, bilirubin, coagulation factors, platelets, and fibrin degradation products. Autotransfusion (500 mL) did not alter coagulation, electrolyte balance, and hematologic findings in recipients except for a clinically insignificant increase in plasma free hemoglobin. Seventeen of 56 samples of the collected blood or processed blood were positive for coagulase (-) Staphylococcus (occasional or rare), but blood cultures before and after autotransfusion were negative in all patients. In the next 11 patients (phase 2), a quantitative bacteriologic study was performed from the collected blood, processed blood, skin, bile duct stump, peritoneal cavity, and room air using a mock reservoir. The processed blood was not transfused. All blood cultures from the patients were sterile. However, coagulase (-) Staphylococcus or Bacillus sp was seen in two cultures from skin, three from the processed blood, and three from air, suggesting that room air and skin were the sources of contamination. When the patients of the two phases of study were compared, postoperative blood cultures were all sterile, and renal function was similar. Therefore, autotransfusion appears to be clinically acceptable during liver transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010438,0,22510861,0,Monitoring prohemostatic treatment in bleeding patients.,"Acutely bleeding patients are commonly found in the trauma and major surgery scenarios. They require prompt and effective treatment to restore an adequate hemostatic pattern, to avoid serious and sometimes life-threatening complications.Different prohemostatic treatments are available, including allogeneic blood derivatives (fresh frozen plasma, platelet concentrates, and cryoprecipitates), prothrombin complex concentrates, specific coagulation factors (fibrinogen, recombinant factor XIII, recombinant activated factor VII), and drugs (protamine for patients under heparin treatment, desmopressin, antifibrinolytics).For decades, prohemostatic treatment of the acutely bleeding patient was based on empirical strategies and clinical judgment, both in terms of a correct diagnosis of the mechanism(s) leading to bleeding, and of an assessment of the effects of the treatment. This empirical strategy may lead to excessive or unnecessary use of allogeneic blood products, as well as to an incorrect, inefficacious, or even dangerous treatment. Different monitoring devices are nowadays available for guiding the diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making process in an acutely bleeding patient. This review addresses the available tools for monitoring prohemostatic treatment of the bleeding patient, with a specific respect for point-of-care tests (thromboelastography, thromboelastometry, platelet function tests, and heparin monitoring systems) at the light of the existing evidence."

In vitro studies were performed using freshly drawn whole blood (WB) from 14 patients with severe haemophilia A and two patients with inhibitory antibodies to FVIII, comparing NN1731 and rFVIIa against a buffer control. Fourteen healthy males served as controls. Dynamic WB coagulation profiles were recorded, quantitatively illustrating the initiation [clotting time = CT (s)], propagation [maximum velocity = MaxVel (mm*100/s)] and termination [maximum clot firmness = MCF (mm*100)] as determined by thromboelastography with minute amounts of tissue factor (TF, Innovin - final dilution 1:50 000, c. 0.12 pM) serving as activator. WB clot stability was assessed using a separate set-up including TF plus tissue plasminogen activator (final concentration 2 nmol/l), evaluating the MCF as well as the area under the elasticity curve (AUEC) after 60 min (mm*100*s). NN1731 shortened the CT more markedly than rFVIIa. At the dose tested, NN1731 even shortened CT in haemophilia below the value of healthy males. NN1731 accelerated MaxVel giving a value indistinguishable from that in healthy males. Furthermore, NN1731 increased clot stability more markedly than rFVIIa. Altogether, these in vitro studies on WB revealed a favourable haemostatic potential of NN1731 compared with rFVIIa in severe haemophilia A, both in the absence and presence of enhanced fibrinolytic activity."

CD010438,0,11679989,0,"Aprotinin in orthotopic liver transplantation: evidence for a prohemostatic, but not a prothrombotic, effect.","Aprotinin reduces blood transfusion requirements in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Concern has been voiced about the potential risk for thrombotic complications when aprotinin is used. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of aprotinin on the two components of the hemostatic system (coagulation and fibrinolysis) in patients undergoing OLT. As part of a larger, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we compared coagulation (fibrinogen level, activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], prothrombin time, and platelet count) and fibrinolytic variables (tissue-type plasminogen activator [tPA] antigen and activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, and D-dimer), as well as thromboelastography (reaction time [r], clot formation time, and maximum amplitude) in 27 patients administered either high-dose aprotinin (2 x 10(6) kallikrein inhibitor units [KIU] at induction, continuous infusion of 1 x 10(6) KIU/h, and 1 x 10(6) KIU before reperfusion; n = 10), regular-dose aprotinin (2 x 10(6) KIU at induction and continuous infusion of 0.5 x 10(6) KIU/h; n = 8), or placebo (n = 9) during OLT. Blood samples were drawn at seven standardized intraoperative times. Baseline characteristics were similar for the three groups. During the anhepatic and postreperfusion periods, fibrinolytic activity (plasma D-dimer and tPA antigen levels) was significantly lower in aprotinin-treated patients compared with the placebo group. Interestingly, coagulation times (aPTT and r) were significantly more prolonged in aprotinin-treated patients than the placebo group. No difference was seen in the incidence of perioperative thrombotic complications in the entire study population (n = 137). Aprotinin has an anticoagulant rather than a procoagulant effect. Its blood-sparing (prohemostatic) effect appears to be the overall result of a strong antifibrinolytic and a weaker anticoagulant effect. These findings argue against a prothrombotic effect of aprotinin in patients undergoing OLT."

CD010438,0,17200777,0,Inhibition of clot formation process by treatment with the low-molecular-weight heparin nadroparin in patients with carotid artery disease undergoing angioplasty and stenting. A thromboelastography study on whole blood.,"Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have become the corner stone of antithrombotic treatment but their administration protocol needs to be optimized for certain groups of patients. In this paper, we studied the influence of nadroparin treatment on clot formation process assessed by thromboelastography in patients with carotid artery disease undergoing angioplasty and stenting. Standard thromboelastography assays (in-TEM and ex-TEM) and minimal TF-triggered thromboelastography assay in citrated whole blood were performed in normal volunteers (n = 20), in patients with carotid artery disease receiving only antiplatelet treatment (n = 30), and in patients undergoing angioplasty receiving nadroparin 5750 anti-Xa IU s.c. twice daily (n = 60). Blood samples were collected four hours after a second injection of nadroparin. In a subgroup of LMWH-patients (n = 18) blood samples were also obtained prior to first injection of LMWH. Antiplatelet treatment had no effect on any parameter of the thromboelastographic pattern. Nadroparin treatment resulted in significant prolongation of clotting time (CT) and clot formation time (CFT) and significantly reduced a -angle in minimal TF-triggered thromboelastography and 30 - 38% of nadroparin treated patients had thromboelastographic parameters beyond the normal maximum limit. In-TEM test revealed a significant prolongation of clotting time while ex-TEM was not modified, and 20 to 30% of the patients had thromboelastographic parameters beyond the normal maximum limit. Anti factor-Xa activity in platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was also measured, and statistical analysis showed that prolongation of CFT of minimal TF-triggered TEM was significantly correlated to the levels of anti-Xa activity in patients ' plasma (p = 0.04; r (2) = 0.7). There was no statistical correlation for any other parameter in all tests. In conclusion, the present study shows that nadroparin treatment in patients with carotid artery disease undergoing endovascular procedures induces significant modification of the thrombus kinetics assessed by minimal TF-triggered whole blood thromboelastography. The clinical relevance of these findings has to be evaluated in future studies."

CD010438,0,20401285,0,Antithrombotic therapy for the CardioWest temporary total artificial heart.,"The CardioWest temporary total artificial heart serves as a viable bridge to orthotopic heart transplantation in patients who are experiencing end-stage refractory biventricular heart failure. This device is associated with a low, albeit still substantial, risk of thrombosis. Platelet interactions with artificial surfaces are complex and result in continuous activation of contact proteins despite therapeutic anticoagulation. We searched the medical literature (publication dates, January 1962-October 2009) in order to evaluate means of mitigating adverse events that have occurred after implantation of the CardioWest temporary total artificial heart.We conclude that the use of a multitargeted antithrombotic approach, involving anticoagulation (bivalirudin and warfarin) and antiplatelet therapy (dipyridamole and aspirin), can mitigate the procoagulative effects of mechanical circulatory assist devices, particularly those that are associated with the CardioWest temporary total artificial heart. Careful monitoring with use of a variant multisystem approach, involving efficacy tests (thrombelastography and light transmittance aggregometry), safety tests (laboratory analyses), and warfarin genomics, may maximize the therapeutic actions and minimize the bleeding risks that are associated with the multitargeted antithrombotic approach. The development and monitoring of individualized antithrombotic regimens require that informed health professionals appreciate the complexities and grasp the hazards that are associated with these therapies."

CD010438,0,19839992,0,Comparative assessment of coagulation changes induced by two different types of heart-lung machine.,"The cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) used in heart surgery has a deleterious effect on hemostasis. The aim of our study was to assess by means of standard laboratory and point-of-care methods changes induced by CPB in coagulation parameters, particularly in platelet function, and to determine whether these changes differ depending on the type of heart-lung machine (HLM) used: minimal extracorporeal circulation system (MECC) and standard HLM. The study enrolled 88 patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery performed on pump. Forty-four interventions were performed with MECC and 44 with standard HLM. Blood was sampled preoperatively, after 30 min on CPB, after weaning from CPB, and 24 h postoperatively. Coagulation and platelet function were assessed using multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA), rotation thromboelastometry, as well as standard laboratory tests. Rotation thromboelastometry and standard laboratory reflected significantly impaired hemostasis after weaning from CPB but no significant differences between the two groups at different time points. Aggregation decreased significantly in both groups as early as 30 min after the institution of CPB (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test) and recovered within the first 24 h postoperatively, without reaching the preoperative level. Intraoperatively, aggregometry values reflected a significantly more severe reduction of platelet function in standard HLM group than in the MECC group (P < 0.01, ProcMixed test). Our findings suggest that MEA and thromboelastometry reflect impairment of coagulation in cardiac surgery performed on different types of HLM and that platelet function is less affected by MECC than by standard HLM."

Is it cost effective?,"A total of 284 patients undergoing myocardial revascularization were prospectively studied to determine if the use of intraoperative autotransfusion or intraoperative autotransfusion plus postoperative reinfusion of shed mediastinal blood decreased transfusion requirements and the use of one or both techniques was cost effective. The Haemonetics Cell Saver System was used for intraoperative autotransfusion and the Sorenson Receptaseal autotransfusion system for postoperative reinfusion of shed mediastinal blood. During Phase 1, the Cell Saver System was used for 57 patients and 93 patients served as a control group. During Phase 2, the Cell Saver System plus the autotransfusion system were used in 43 patients and 91 patients were in the control group. Separate parallel analyses to compare the blood conservation groups to control groups were conducted for each phase of the study. The patient groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, preoperative red cell mass, preoperative hematocrit value, number of bypasses, and use of internal mammary grafts. Blood conservation techniques resulted in significant reductions in the use of bank blood. During Phase 1, Cell Saver System patients received an average of 2.8 units of packed cells versus 4.7 units for control patients. Transfusion was avoided entirely in 14% of Cell Saver System patients compared to 3% of control patients. During Phase 2, patients subjected to both the Cell Saver System and the autotransfusion system received an average of 1 unit of packed red cells versus 3 units for control patients. Transfusion was required in only 42% of patients subjected to both the Cell Saver System and the autotransfusion system compared to 85% of control patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed that the use of the Cell Saver System in Phase 1 and the Cell Saver System and autotransfusion system in Phase 2 were each independently predictive of decreased transfusion requirements. The total ""blood-related costs"" (including cost for all bank blood products plus Receptaseal and Cell Saver System equipment) was slightly lower for the blood conservation patients in both Phase 1 ($555.00 versus $615.00, no significant difference) and Phase 2 ($373.00 versus $426.00, no significant difference). Intraoperative use of the Cell Saver System is associated with substantial savings of bank blood, and the addition of postoperative reinfusion of shed mediastinal blood results in further bank blood savings. The use of blood conservation techniques is cost effective; that is, the costs incurred for the blood conservation equipment are more than offset by the resultant dollar savings for blood products."

We tested the hypotheses that patients with severe OSA are hypercoagulable and that two weeks of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment reduces this hypercoagulability. In a prospective crossover study, twelve patients were randomized to either CPAP or no-CPAP for two weeks, a one week washout period, and then the other testing period for two weeks. Thromboelastography was used to assess coagulability at the start and end of each period and the apnoea-hypopnea indices (AHI) were measured at the end of each period. At baseline, ten patients had, compared to reference values, shorter clotting times, six increased rate of clot formation, twelve increased clot strength, and ten increased clotting indices. CPAP significantly reduced AHI (p=0.0003), clot strength (p=0.019) and clotting index (p=0.014). Hypercoagulability in patients with OSA can be detected by thromboelastography, and is reduced by CPAP."

CD010438,0,9327128,0,Formation of microscale gradients of protein using heterobifunctional photolinkers.,"Gradients of biological molecules on a microscale have been postulated to elicit cellular responses, such as migration. However, it has been difficult to prepare such gradients for experimental testing. A means for producing such gradients has been developed using a heterobifunctional photolinking agent with laser light activation. The photolinking agent synthesized includes an N-hydroxysuccinimide group and a photoreactive benzophenone (BP) separated by a tetraethylene glycol (TEG) spacer. The presence of the tetraethylene glycol spacer renders the photolinker hydrophilic, a desirable trait for conjugation in aqueous solutions. The linker was then conjugated to R-phycoerythrin (R-PE), a fluorescent protein. The resulting photolinker-R-phycoerythrin conjugate (BP-TEG-PE) was then immobilized onto a polystyrene surface by laser irradiation on a motorized stage. By varying exposure time of the sample to the beam, the amount of BP-TEG-PE immobilized on the surface was changed over an order of magnitude over a distance of 250 microns. This method can be applied to prepare gradients of proteins that elicit biological responses, such as extracellular matrix proteins or growth factors, and to study the biological effects of such gradients."

One hundred and seven procedures were done on Haemonetics MCS 3p using SDP protocol, 49 procedures were done on Haemonetics MCS 3p using PLP protocol, and 107 were done on Baxter CS 3000 plus. Pre-procedure donor's platelet count and haemoglobin were comparable in all the groups. Platelet yield was comparable in PLP (6.44 x 10(11) platelets) and SDP (5.27 x 10(11)) protocols, but significantly less in Baxter (4.05 x 10(11) platelets, P < 0.001 for PLP and P < 0.05 for SDP). Efficiency of platelet removal was statistically significantly different in all the groups (P < 0.0001), however it was more in PLP (PLP-55.02%, SDP-47.38%, Baxter 38.98%). A significant number of products (19.51%) of Baxter failed to comply platelet count of product < or = 2,435 x 10(9)/l compared to 5.13% in PLP and 1.23% in SDP group; 36.96% of units from PLP and 28% from SDP qualified for split products compared to 1.18% of Baxter.

It measures the time required for whole blood to occlude a membrane impregnated with either epinephrine (EPI) or adenosine 5'diphosphate (ADP). The results are reported as closure time (CT-EPI or CT-ADP) in seconds. The thromboelastogram (TEG) measures whole blood clotting and the maximum amplitude (MA) correlates with platelet count and function. We wished to establish whether there is a correlation between the CT and platelet count, between the CT and MA, and between the MA and platelet count."

CD010438,0,2554502,0,Comparative human pharmacology of low molecular weight heparins.,"The pharmacodynamics of LMW heparins differ consistently from those of normal heparin. The relative bioavailability is greater than 90% and for some LMW heparins more than 100% after subcutaneous administration, as measured by the anti-Factor Xa activity. This indicates release of endothelial bound glycosaminoglycans with anti-Factor Xa-like activities. Direct determination of the LPL and HTGL activities demonstrate higher capacities of two and a lower capacity of three LMW heparins to release these enzymes from their endothelial glycoprotein receptors into the bloodstream. Thus, all LMW heparins are characterized by improved pharmacodynamics compared with normal heparin, but their anti-Xa to APTT and anti-Xa to anti-IIa ratios and half-lives differ among each other. The neutralization of the anticoagulant effects of LMW heparins by protamine are similar in vitro and in vivo at equigravimetric doses. However, unfractionated heparin and LMW heparins are not completely antagonized by protamine on a whole blood clotting test (thrombelastography). This inhibition of Factor Xa of LMW heparins is counteracted not completely by protamine. This may be due to a release of other glucosaminoglycans by LMW heparins. The present overview demonstrates that a comparative human pharmacology gives useful devices for prophylactic and therapeutic regimen for LMW heparins in patients in addition to the data obtained from animal models."

CD010438,0,1200737,0,[Effect of blue and red light on the synthesis of ribosomal RNA in Chlorella].,"In autotrophic cultures of Chlorella pyrenoidosa (strain 211-8b) incorporation of tritiated guanosine and uridine into ribosomal RNA is stimulated by light. Blue light of wavelengths around 457 nm is considerably more effective than red light around 679 nm (5-10(-10) Einstein cm-2 sec-1 for both). This effect can be demonstrated for young daughter cells (at the end of the dark period) and for older cells (at the end of the light period). It is shown to depend on a regulation of rRNA-synthesis. The blue light dependent enhancement of incorporation is more pronounced in the cytoplasmic rRNA (25 and 18 s) than in the chloroplast rRNA (23 and 16 s). Blue light of low intensity (1-10(-10) Einstein cm-2 sec-1) has nearly the same effectivity as the fivefold intensity, whereas red light of equal quantum fluxes enhances incorporation only slightly compared with the dark control. The blue light dependent enhancement of rRNA-synthesis continues in the following darkness in contrary to that caused by red light. This enhancement is also found in DCMU-poisened cultures. In contrast to this, is red light in presence of DCMU, incorporation into rRNA is nearly the same as in dark. It is concluded that the regulation of rRNA-synthesis in red light is closely connected to complete photosynthesis, while in blue light an additional regulation takes place independent of photosynthesis."

Cross-comparison of light transmission aggregometry, VerifyNow system, platelet count drop, thromboelastography (TEG) and urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B(2).","Variable biological effect of aspirin is suggested to be related to pharmacological resistance. The incidence of this so-called ""resistant"" state varies with the study population and the assay used. We determined performance features of five assays used to assess aspirin effects in non-smoking healthy volunteers not taking any drug known to interfere with platelet function. Blood and urine samples were obtained immediately before and after 8-10 days of aspirin 80 mg intake. Forty-five participants 19-59 years old were enrolled. The sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), and optimal cut-off (CO) value to detect the effect of aspirin were: light transmission aggregometry (LTA) with 1.6 mM arachidonic acid (AA) - SE 100%, SP 95.9%, CO 20%; LTA with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) 10 microM - SE 84.4%, SP 77.8%, CO 70%; VerifyNow Aspirin - SE 100%, SP 95.6%, CO 550 ARU; platelet count drop - SE 82.2%, SP 86,7%, CO 55%; TEG((R)) - SE 82,9%, SP 75,8%, CO 90%; and urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B(2) levels (11-dHTB(2)) - SE 62.2%, SP 82.2%, CO 60 pg/ml. AA-induced LTA and the VerifyNow assay reliably detected aspirin intake in all subjects; there was wide overlap in pre- and post- aspirin results with ADP-induced LTA, platelet count drop, TEG((R)) and urinary 11-dHTB(2) assays. These results suggest that some of the variability in the reported incidence of ""aspirin resistance"" is unrelated to aspirin intake but related to inherent limitations of some assays to detect aspirin mediated effects or to underlying platelet reactivity variability independent of aspirin-mediated cyclooxygenase-1 inhibition."

The propositus is a 28-year-old male who presented easy bruising, epistaxis, hematomas, hematuria and occasional hemartrosis since early childhood. The severely prolonged prothrombin time was corrected by normal serum but not by adsorbed normal plasma. The abnormality was not corrected by the plasma of a patient with factor X deficiency, but by the plasma of patients with factor II or VII deficiencies. Partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin consumption and the thromboplastin generation test were abnormal. The thromboelastogram showed a prolonged 'K' and 'r' together with a normal 'ma'. Factor X was very low (smaller than 1%). Platelet tests were normal. No factor X band or precipitates were seen on electroimmunoassay and on the cross-over electrophoresis. The non-consanguineous parents and several other members of the family were found to be heterozygotes."

CD010438,0,10544364,0,Evaluation of developmentally appropriate programs for adolescent tobacco cessation.,"Despite introduction of numerous smoking prevention programs in schools, tobacco use has not declined among adolescents. Schools face the dilemma of what to do with students who smoke and are not ready to quit. This study evaluated two programs based on the stages of change model. The educational program, the Tobacco Education Group (TEG), was designed for adolescents not yet thinking about quitting. The cessation program, the Tobacco Awareness Program (TAP), was intended for adolescents who want to quit. Evaluation was completed on 351 students at six public high schools. Compared to a control group of adolescent smokers not assigned to programs, both intervention groups significantly decreased tobacco use. Self-reported use was validated biochemically. Self-efficacy for quitting increased in both programs. Posttest use was predicted by posttest self-efficacy, peer support, and parental support, after controlling for initial use and initial self-efficacy."
CD010438,0,11573637,0,Reduced haemostatic factor transfusion using heparinase-modified thrombelastography during cardiopulmonary bypass.,"We set out to determine if the heparinase-modified thrombelastogram using anticoagulated blood from patients during cardiac surgery could guide treatment with haemostatic components. In 60 patients a simple algorithm predicted a possible 60-80% decrease in the use of haemostatic components. In a second series, 30 patients were allocated to receive components using this intra-operative algorithm and 30 using clinical criteria and laboratory-based tests. Ten patients in the clinical group received a total of 16 units of fresh frozen plasma and nine platelet concentrates compared with five patients transfused with five units of fresh frozen plasma and one platelet concentrate in the algorithm group. Twelve-hour chest tube losses [algorithm group 470 (295-820) ml, clinically managed group 390 (240-820) ml (median, quartile values)] were not different between groups despite the threefold reduction in the use of haemostatic products, showing that intra-operative monitoring of coagulation in the anticoagulated patient can be used to guide treatment."

CD010438,0,2817543,0,[Autologous transfusion by peroperative salvage in orthotopic transplantation of the liver].,"As large quantities of blood are required during orthotopic liver transplantation, intraoperative autotransfusion is therefore often carried out in adult patients. This study aimed to assess the ease of use of this technique, its efficiency and possible side-effects. Intraoperative blood salvage was carried out using a Cell Saver 4R (Haemonetics) in 14 patients. The chest blood was collected, anticoagulated with heparin and sodium citrate, centrifuged and washed with Ringer lactate. During surgery, and the subsequent 5 days, the following data were recorded: red cell and platelet count, haemoglobin concentration, parameters of renal function, potassium, citrate and fibrinogen levels, parameters of renal function, blood cultures and the extubation delay. Autotransfusion was simple to use, with no side-effects during the procedure. An average of 20.5 red cell packs were required, of which 59.2 +/- 2.3% were supplied by autotransfusion. The volume of transfused blood was similar, or inferior, to other studies. The different haematological parameters, blood gases and serum potassium levels remained stable. Only 4 +/- 2.8 red cell packs were required postoperatively to maintain a stable haematocrit value. There was no increase in thrombin time, and therefore no effect due to the used heparin. Citrate levels were correlated with the amount of autotransfused blood. They were lower than in other studies because autotransfusion limited the citrate load. There was no haemolysis. Postoperative renal function remained normal. There was no change in the blood coagulation profile, except when large volumes were transfused, resulting in a dilutional coagulopathy. Extubation was always carried out during the first two postoperative days. Bacteriological studies remained negative, no bacteraemia being noted. During orthotopic liver transplantation autotransfusion is a simple, reliable technique, with few side-effects."

Patients were randomized to receive 15 mL kg(-1) of either 4% albumin, 4% succinylated gelatin, or 6% hydroxyethyl starch (molecular weight of 200 kDa/degree of substitution 0.5) as a short-term infusion. There was a comparable decrease in maximum clot firmness of thromboelastometry tracings in gelatin and hydroxyethyl starch groups immediately after completion of the infusion, whereas these values remained unchanged in the albumin group. The impairment in clot strength persisted up to 2 h, although the values partly recovered. Postoperative bleeding correlated inversely with the clot strength in pooled data of the artificial colloids. Fibrin formation (clot formation time, alpha-angle) and fibrinogen-dependent clot strength (maximum clot firmness and shear elastic modulus) were more disturbed in the hydroxyethyl starch group than in the gelatin group. We conclude that after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, both gelatin and hydroxyethyl starch impair clot strength and fibrin buildup, which may predispose patients to increased blood loss. The greatest impairment in hemostasis was seen after hydroxyethyl starch administration, whereas albumin appeared to have the least effect on hemostatic variables."

We monitored the survival and function of transfused platelets by flow cytometry and thrombelastography in a patient with GT. Gating on CD42a+ allowed identification of even a few transfused platelets. Only by gating on these CD41+ CD42a+ cells were we able to demonstrate their capability to bind fibrinogen and PAC-1 upon activation. Platelets were rapidly cleared from the circulation as a result of boosted isoantibodies. The contribution of transfused platelets to clot formation was also demonstrated by thrombelastography by blocking their function with abciximab.

We tested the hypothesis that carbon monoxide released from tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer (CORM-2) would diminish the velocity of formation and strength of plasma thrombi as determined by thrombelastography. Normal plasma was exposed to 0 or 100 micromol/l CORM-2 or inactivated CORM-2 (iCORM-2), with coagulation initiated with tissue factor or celite (n = 8 per condition). Additional experiments utilized factor XIII (FXIII) deficient plasma activated with celite. Coagulation kinetics was monitored with thrombelastography for 15 min. CORM-2, and to a lesser extent, iCORM-2, significantly (P < 0.05) increased the velocity of formation (122 and 56%, respectively) and strength (66 and 57%, respectively) of plasma clots initiated with either tissue factor or celite compared with thrombi not exposed to CORM-2 or iCORM. In FXIII deficient plasma CORM-2 significantly increased the velocity of clot formation (264%) and strength (240%). Carbon monoxide and iCORM-2 derived from CORM-2 markedly enhance the velocity of clot growth and strength. These findings serve as the rationale for further investigations to determine if CORMs could be utilized as hemostatic agents."

The Thrombelastograph((R)) (TEG; Haemoscope Corp., Morton Grove, IL) variables of reaction time, coagulation time, maximum amplitude, and growth angle were determined. The following plasma substitutes were tested: two gelatin solutions (4% gelatin polysuccinate and 5.5% oxypolygelatin); two dextrans (10% dextran 40 and 6% dextran 60); and five hydroxyethyl starch (HES) preparations (6% HES 70/0.5-0.55, 3% HES 200/0.5, 6% HES 200/0.5, 10% HES 200/0.5, and 6% HES 450/0.7). Ringer's solution was also tested to assist analyzing the intrinsic effect of colloid molecules on blood coagulation. The dilution ratios of citrated blood volume to plasma substitute volume were 10:2, 10:4, and 10:10. Blood coagulation was affected by plasma substitutes when the dilution ratios of citrated blood volume to colloid solution volume were 10:4 and 10:10. TEG variables did not change significantly after in vitro hemodilution with lactated Ringer's solution. The tested gelatin solutions showed less intrinsic effect on blood coagulation than other plasma substitutes. All HES preparations showed similar intrinsic effects as 6% dextran 60. The plasma substitute of 10% dextran 40 had the strongest effect on coagulation. Coagulation time was the most markedly affected TEG variable. Blood coagulation may be compromised when the dilution ratio of blood volume to colloid solution volume is >10:4. Whereas gelatin solutions have less intrinsic effect on blood coagulation, 10% dextran 40 has the strongest effect on coagulation."

A change in the plasmatic coagulation system attributable to the combination therapy could not be demonstrated in any patient. The influence of the cytostatic combination on the platelet-dependent haemostasis was small; a decrease in platelet count could be observed in only one patient, in whom an additional causative damage to thrombopoiesis due to the underlying disease could be assumed. Regardless of the cytostatic therapy there were indications of a hypercoagulability in 10 patients. This explains the increased susceptibility of such patients for thromboses or consumption coagulopathy."

CD010438,0,21536113,0,Comprehensive comparison of two new biodegradable gene carriers.,"Safety and high transfection efficiency are the prerequisites for an ideal gene vector. Polyethylenimine (PEI), especially PEI 25k (25 kDa), is a well-known cationic gene carrier with high transfection efficiency. However, the high toxicity, depended on its molecular weight, has limited its use as a potential gene carrier. In our research, for the purpose of reducing the toxicity and increasing the transfection efficiency and further to inspect where the degradation of these biodegradable polymers take place would be more beneficial, in cytoplasm or in endocytic vesicles, two kinds of degradable polymers were synthesized. One is an acid-liable PEI derivate (PEI-GA) which was cross-linked by PEI 2k with glutadialdehyde (GA) through imine linkages and the other one (PEI-TEG) was cross-linked PEI 2k with modified triethyleneglycol (TEG) through biscarbamate linkages and can be degraded at neutral environment. By the use of a series of assay methods both in vitro and in vivo, the results showed that PEI-TEG was found to be biodegradable at neutral environment and exhibit high transfection ability with low toxicity, which indicated its potential as a candidate carrier for gene therapy."
CD010438,0,7949107,0,UVB irradiation of human platelet concentrates does not prevent HLA alloimmunization in recipients.,"Exposure of platelet concentrates (PCs) to ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) has been advocated as an alternative method for prevention of the onset of HLA sensitization in recipients. In this study, pooled PCs were irradiated in a Haemonetics UV irradiator (Haemonetics Corp, Braintree, MA) at a dose that did not induce platelet activation. The effect of UVB irradiation on prevention of primary HLA sensitization was evaluated in a prospective controlled clinical study performed in cardiac patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were treated with filtered red blood cells and a single transfusion of either standard (control group) or UVB-irradiated (UVB group) pooled platelets prepared from 12 donors. Five of 39 patients in the control group and 6 of 62 patients in the UVB group developed allo-antibodies against HLA antigens, which is not significantly different (P = .62). This unexpected finding prompted us to check the efficacy of UVB irradiation. We determined UVB-specific DNA damage in cells by measuring the fluorescence from a labeled specific monoclonal antibody against thymine dimers. With this novel flow cytometer technique, we estimated in UVB-irradiated leukocytes in saline that a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 47 +/- 2 arbitrary units (n = 6) correlated with abolition of alloreactivity in mixed lymphocyte cultures and delayed cell death (within 72 hours). MFI in leukocytes suspended in plasma and exposed to the clinical dose of UVB was sixfold higher (310 +/- 41 arbitrary units) and resulted in early cell death (within 24 hours). We hypothesize that this high level of UVB radiation induces fragmentation of the leukocytes. As a consequence, the poor results of UVB irradiation may be explained by the onset of HLA-alloimmunization induced by soluble donor HLA class I antigens processed and presented by host antigen-presenting cells."

The data obtained demonstrate that the unfavorable prognostic signs may include steady and increasing hyperosmia, rise of the mmol discriminant of osmolality to over 35-40 mOsm/l, a progressive decrease of the rheological blood parameters and of colloid-osmotic pressure together with a progressive reduction of the urine/blood osmolality, which points to the rupture of the compensation for osmotic homeostasis and decompensation for the functional system regulating the blood aggregation state."
