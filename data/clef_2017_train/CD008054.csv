CD008054,0,21145755,0,Future challenges in head and neck cancer: from the bench to the bedside?,"HNC is the 11th most frequent carcinoma with a world-wide yearly incidence exceeding over half a million cases [1], a 10:1 male gender predilection and country specific variability [2]. The principal risk factors are tobacco and alcohol use and, in a growing population without these exposures, HPV infection. While much progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of cancer, the 5-year mortality of head and neck cancer has remained approximately 50%. To this date we have not been able to translate as much of our basic science knowledge into significant disease altering therapeutic strategies in terms of local, loco-regional, functional and overall survival. Challenges remain in all aspects of head and neck cancer management: prevention, diagnosis, surgical and non-surgical treatment."
CD008054,0,16418511,1,Cost-effectiveness analysis based on the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion Triage Study (ALTS).,"The ALTS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS] and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL] Triage Study) suggests that, for women diagnosed with ASCUS, human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing followed by referral to colposcopy of only those women with oncogenic HPV (i.e., HPV DNA testing) is as effective at detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or cancer (CIN3+) as referring all women with ASCUS for immediate colposcopy. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of the ALTS trial to determine whether HPV DNA testing is a cost-effective alternative to immediate colposcopy or conservative management with up to three cytology examinations."
CD008054,0,17566560,0,Human papillomavirus testing for precancerous lesions of the cervix.,"As new technologies are introduced that increase the sensitivity of detecting patients at risk and the incidence of cervical cancer continues to decrease in the US, annual screening for this disease may actually be overscreening. It has been shown that the screening interval can safely be increased to every 2 years if liquid-based testing is performed with reflex HPV testing in patients under 30 and can be increased to every three years in patients over the age of 30 if they are done together and both are negative.13,14 As we move into the age of risk stratification as a screening tool with HPV testing and liquid-based screening, it is imperative that the aforementioned recommendations are followed in order to keep the costs of screening at a minimum. Unfortunately, despite data confirming its safety and efficacy, many patients are unconvinced. The overwhelming respondents in one series would still seek to obtain annual screening. In order to complete the paradigm shift in the screening for cervical cancer using the current technologies, more education will be required of the public and health care community to understand and accept the differences, most notably the increased screening interval. The true effects of the HPV vaccine will not be known for some time. Therefore, appropriate screening is still imperative even for those vaccinated because it does not offer complete protection from other strains of the HPV virus."
CD008054,0,10976721,0,Human papillomavirus detection by the hybrid capture II assay: a reliable test to select women with normal cervical smears at risk for developing cervical lesions.,"The reliability of the Hybrid Capture II (HC-II; Digene, Silver Spring, MD, U.S.A.) assay was tested in detecting 18 human Papillomavirus (HPV) types for the screening of cervical lesions. Cytology, HPV testing, colposcopy, and biopsy were used to monitor 204 women with normal smears at the first entry. The median follow-up was 15 months (range, 4-27 months). The primary endpoint was clinical progression defined as the presence of a cervical intraepithelial lesion at the biopsy. In the patient population of 204 HPV-infected women, 81 (39.7%) had a persistent HPV infection at two or three examinations with a final histologic diagnosis of 14 high-grade and 13 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) within 4 to 22 months. Women with regressive HPV infection did not develop any lesion during the same period. The evaluation of the viral load of high-risk HPV by the HC-II did not represent a sensitive approach to predict the persistence or the apparition of high-grade lesions. Thus, persistent high-risk HPV infection detected with HC-II represents a reliable tool to select populations at risk for the development of high-grade cervical lesions."
CD008054,0,17385693,0,Prevalence of human papillomavirus types in women screened by cytology in Germany.,"Incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer are higher in Germany than in other Western European countries. Type-specific human papillomavirus (HPV) distribution was investigated for the first time in Germany in an epidemiological study including 8,101 women. Women above the age of 30 years, self-referring for cervical cancer screening, were enrolled in two study centers in Hannover (Northern Germany) and TÃ¼bingen (Southern Germany). Participants were screened by the Pap smear and the hybrid capture 2 (HC2) test using the high-risk probe. All samples that were positive by the HC2 test were genotyped using the prototype PGMY09/11 PCR line blot assay. Most women in the study population had a negative Pap smear (96.7%). Prevalence of high-risk type HPV detected by HC2 was 6.4% and prevalence of carcinogenic types detected by PGMY09/11 was 4.3%. Of the PGMY09/11 PCR-positive women, 70.2% had a single infection, 28.1% had multiple infections and 1.7% remained uncharacterized. 32 different HPV types were detected using PGMY09/11 PCR. HPV 16, 31, 52, 51, 18, and 45 were the most common carcinogenic types in the study population. Among women with histologically confirmed high-grade lesions HPV 16, 45, 58, 18, 31, 33, and 52 were the predominant types. These results provide valuable information for the management of HPV infections in Germany, both in terms of future strategies of screening and vaccination."
CD008054,0,19436214,1,"A 7.5-year prospective study of longer than 18 months type-specific human papillomavirus persistence in a routine cytology-based cervical screening population of about 31,000 women in West Germany.","The objective of this study was to analyse the prevalence, infection pattern, duration and outcome of long-term, type-specific, persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in a routine cytology-based cervical screening population of West German women followed up for 7.5 years. From a screening population of 31,000 women, a strictly selected cohort of 100 patients with > or =18-month persistent, type-specific HPV infection were prospectively followed up for a mean of 35.52 months (+/-13.0). HPV type prevalence and odds ratios for regression, progression and steady state were analysed, as well as the influence of age and HPV coinfection on outcome. Altogether, 21 different genotypes were detected. Seventy-two percent of women were infected with high-risk HPVs, 24% with low-risk and 4% with unknown risk HPV types; 44% of cases had coinfections with multiple HPV types. The risk of progression in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions was the highest for infections with high-risk HPVs [odds ratio: 2.2 (0.79-6.11, 95% confidence interval)], whereas cases with low-risk and unknown risk HPVs tended to regress or remained unchanged during follow-up. The mean duration of infections showed considerable variation among the different HPV types and risk groups detected and ranged between 19.7 and 54.3 months. Age was not significantly associated with disease progression and infection duration, and histology had a poor sensitivity for detecting high-grade dysplasia. In conclusion, detecting long-term persistent HPV infections by genotyping may help to identify women with cervical intraepithelial lesions who are at lower and higher risk of developing high-grade precancer and cancer. This may influence future screening strategies and therapy decisions."
CD008054,0,9461053,0,1998 guidelines for treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.,"These guidelines for the treatment of patients who have sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were developed by CDC staff members after consultation with a group of invited experts who met in Atlanta on February 10-12, 1997. The information in this report updates the ""1993 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines"" (MMWR 1993;42[no. RR-14]). Included are new recommendations for treatment of primary and recurrent genital herpes and management of pelvic inflammatory disease; a new patient-applied medication for treatment of genital warts; and a revised approach to the management of victims of sexual assault. Revised sections describe the evaluation of urethritis and the diagnostic evaluation of congenital syphilis. These guidelines also include expanded sections concerning STDs among infants, children, and pregnant women and the management of patients who have asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection, genital warts, and genital herpes. Guidelines are provided for vaccine-preventable STDs, including recommendations for the use of hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines."
CD008054,0,14989139,1,Human papillomavirus viral load in predicting high-grade CIN in women with cervical smears showing only atypical squamous cells or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.,Human papillomavirus (HPV) viral load may have an important role in predicting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in women with cervical smears showing atypical squamous cells or LSIL.
CD008054,0,8228010,0,"[Cancer of the cervix, papillomavirus, contraception and tobacco].","This survey started in May 1989 and deals with 2,436 patients treated by 10 gynecologists from the Brussels region. In addition to routine cytological analysis in cervical smears, an additional test for Human Papilloma Virus (HPV 16, 18 and 33) was advised for these women. Gynecologists filled in a questionnaire about these patients. In cases with benign cytology, virus prevalence was 2 times greater in woman who took contraceptive pills, over at least 6 months, than in each of the other groups using either diaphragm or male condoms or no contraception, or at menopausal age. It was strange to find that viral prevalence varied according to the pill trade mark, but not according to the pill hormonal content. No confounding factor in population recruitment could be detected. In contrast to viral infection, prevalence of cancer lesions was not increased in the oral contraception group. Squamous intraepithelial lesions of Low Grade and High Grade (SIL LG and HG) were on the contrary 2 times less frequent in women taking the pill, with or without HPV infection. During follow-up of 223 women, the same HPV genotype persisted in SIL lesions but it disappeared within 4 to 8 weeks in 68% of normal cervical smears. However, beyond this period, the proportion of women with persisting virus remained nearly constant, indicating that a subgroup may be less able to mount a defence against the infection. Risk factor of cigarette smoking for SIL LG or HG was 1.6 in women with HPV and 4.0 in those with no virus. This factor was 3.3 in women with oral contraception and 4.5 in the other group."
CD008054,0,16169066,0,Clinical responses to Cidofovir applied topically to women with high grade vulval intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Cidofovir is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate, with broad spectrum anti-viral activity. It has previously been used in a number of clinical settings, including high grade intraepithelial disease in the cervix and low grade vulval disease. This pilot study was set up to assess whether Cidofovir might be useful in treating high grade vulval intraepithelial neoplasia."
CD008054,0,7729739,0,Immunologic diagnosis and monitoring of cervical cancers using in vitro translated HPV proteins.,"E6 and E7 proteins, the transforming proteins of oncogenic HPVs, are known to be associated with the occurrence of cervical cancer. In radioimmunoprecipitation assays in which in vitro-transcripted and translated HPV-16 E6 and E7 proteins were used, patients with HPV-16-associated invasive cervical cancer (group I) had greater seroreactivity than patients in most of the other groups, including patients with invasive cervical cancer who were infected with other types of HPVs (group II), cervical cancer patients with nondetectable HPVs (group III), patients with HPV-16-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (group IV), and unaffected normal controls with noncervical lesions (group V) (P < 0.05). The sera of patients in group I, when compared with the sera of other groups, were significantly reactive with one and/or two proteins (P < 0.05). Antibodies to HPV-16 E6 and E7 proteins were detected in patients with invasive cancer more than in those with CIN. The positive rates for E6 protein were 4.2% (1/24), 43.8% (7/16), 57.1% (8/14), 100% (5/5), and 100% (1/1), and the positive rates of E7 protein were 4.2% (1/24), 12.5% (2/16), 35.7% (5/14), 60% (3/5), and 100% (1/1) from CINs through stages I, IIa, IIb, and III of HPV-16-associated cervical cancers, respectively. The positive rates for E6 and E7 proteins were significantly increased with the advancing of the clinical stages of cervical cancer (P < 0.05 for E6 and E7). To examine the change in antibody titers of HPV-16 E7 protein during diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, we tested serial serum samples from 14 patients of group I. The antibody titers were correlated to the clinical course of disease in some cases. The positive levels of E7 antibody were decreased when the treatment was effective, but in 1 patient who had shown recurrence or progression, positive seroreactivity was maintained. Antibodies to HPV-16 E6 and E7 proteins might be effective virus-specific and disease state-specific markers of HPV-16-associated cervical cancer."
CD008054,0,1413841,0,Prognostic factors in parathyroid cancer: a review of 95 cases.,"The clinical course, histopathology, and tumor DNA distribution patterns were analyzed in 95 patients with parathyroid cancer. The median follow-up was 6 years (range 1-25 years). Eighteen patients received a benign diagnosis at their first operation. The initial procedure was tumor resection in 42 patients and tumor resection plus partial or total thyroidectomy in 40 patients. Forty patients developed recurrent disease and 36 patients underwent 1 to 9 re-operations. Cervical recurrence and lung metastases were most commonly encountered. The median time from the first operation to recurrence was 33 months (range 1-228 month). Twenty-one patients died of parathyroid cancer a median of 28 months following discovery of their first recurrence. The histopathological reevaluation confirmed unequivocal parathyroid cancer, i.e., infiltration and/or metastases, in 41 cases. Fifty-four cases lacked these criteria but showed various forms of atypia. Image cytometry demonstrated tumor aneuploidy in 26 of 39 cases with definite cancer by histological criteria, compared to the 13 of the 52 with equivocal histological diagnosis. Twelve patients with aneuploid tumors and 7 patients with euploid tumors died of parathyroid cancer. In a multivariate analysis, patients treated with extensive surgery, i.e., tumor resection and unilateral or bilateral thyroidectomy, had a longer survival and a longer relapse-free period. Other factors of importance for survival were age and histopathology. Histopathology and an aberrant nuclear DNA content were important factors for the time to recurrence. We conclude that histopathology alone is unable to confirm a cancer diagnosis in the absence of infiltration and/or metastases. Because recurrence may occur late, patients should be followed closely. Even repeated surgical interventions have proven beneficial."
CD008054,0,16009345,0,G-308A TNF-alpha polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of invasive cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer is initiated by high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV-16 and HPV-18), but an effective immune response may control the progression of this disease. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, that has been implicated in several cancers. In a case-control study, we evaluated the association between the G-308A TNF-alpha promoter polymorphism and the risk for invasive cervical cancer (ICC). TNF-alpha polymorphism was analyzed by PCR-RFLP and confirmed by sequencing. DNA was obtained from blood samples of 439 individuals, including 195 patients with ICC and 244 normal healthy controls. According to our results, women carrying the A allele present a twofold increased risk of developing ICC (p=0.006; OR=1.88; 95% CI [1.20-2.94]). In conclusion, our study suggests that the presence of the high producer allele -308A in the TNF-alpha gene appears to be associated with an increased risk for the development of ICC."
CD008054,0,11698001,1,Is the human papillomavirus test in combination with the Papanicolaou test useful for management of patients with diagnoses of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions?,To determine whether human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is useful in the evaluation of patients diagnosed with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS)/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and whether the HPV test is appropriate as an alternative screening method.
CD008054,0,9126136,0,Cervical specimens collected in liquid buffer are suitable for both cytologic screening and ancillary human papillomavirus testing.,"Several new techniques have been developed to improve the sensitivity of cervical carcinoma screening and reduce equivocal cytologic diagnoses referred to as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). This study evaluates the effectiveness of combining two newly introduced diagnostic techniques: preparation of thin-layer cytologic slides from ThinPrep liquid buffer and selected Hybrid Capture testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA. Because HPV DNA detection has been strongly associated with the presence of a cervical carcinoma precursor (""squamous intraepithelial lesion,"" or SIL), HPV testing might be useful for identifying women with ASCUS who have an underlying SIL."
CD008054,0,8965999,0,[Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and genital condylomatosis in HIV-positive patients. Clinical aspects and management].,"In this study prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and genital condylomatosis in HIV-positive women and the possible relation between HIV and HPV infection and CIN have been analyzed. 66 seropositive women underwent cytological, colposcopic and, when necessary, histologic examination and the results have been compared with those obtained from 150 HIV-seronegative controls. HIV-positive patients were divided in two groups, depending on number of CD4+/mm3, < 400 or > = 400, to evaluate the relation between immunity and HPV infection and/or CIN. 35 seropositive and 136 seronegative patients affected by genital condylomatosis and/or CIN I were submitted to laser CO2 vaporization and the results of the treatment have been compared. All cases of CIN II and III underwent laser CO2 conization. Among HIV-seropositive patients the prevalence of genital condylomatosis appeared to be 87.9% and among the seronegative controls 18% (p < 0.001). Multilocated condylomatosis represented 58.7% of genital condylomatosis among seropositive women and 11.1% among the seronegative patients. In HIV-seropositive group the prevalence of genital condylomatosis was of 95.2% among women with CD4+ < 400 and of 75% among those with CD4+ > = 400 (p > 0.01). 13 patients (19.7%) of the 66 seropositive women and 12 of the 150 (8%) seronegative had a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. A CIN III was diagnosed in 9 seropositive patients (13.6%) and in 5 seronegative (3.3%). Among the HIV-seropositive women who underwent laser vaporization for genital condylomatosis a cure-rate of 34.5% was found; among seronegative women who underwent the same treatment the cure-rate was of 79.4%. Those patients who underwent laser conization resulted all cured at first check. In the group of HIV-seropositive women a higher prevalence (p < 0.001) of genital condylomatosis, particularly multilocated localization, has been found than in HIV-seronegative patients. An increased prevalence of CIN has also been found among HIV-seropositive women. Genital condylomatosis in seropositive patients resulted extremely difficult to treat with laser vaporization in contrast with the 100% success in laser conization for high-grade CIN."
CD008054,0,1325347,0,Risk of progression in low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.,"In order to evaluate the evolution of the low grade dysplasia using colpocytologic follow-up, 150 women, enrolled in this study, were submitted to yearly colpocytologic control for a period of four years. The rate of progression toward more severe forms was very low; three cases (2.14%) in the first year, one case (0.7%) in the second and two cases (2.32%) in the fourth. Eighty-eight per cent of the patients had cytologic signs of Human Papilloma Virus infection detected in cytologic and histologic examination."
CD008054,0,19961986,0,Cytologic regression in women with atypical squamous cells of unknown significance and negative human papillomavirus test.,The aim of this study was to investigate the cytologic regression in women with atypical squamous cells of unknown significance and negative high-risk human papillomavirus test.
CD008054,0,15782067,1,Immunocytochemical expression of p16INK4A and Ki-67 in cytologically negative and equivocal pap smears positive for oncogenic human papillomavirus.,"This study was designed to analyze the cross-sectional comparison of the p16 and Ki-67 immunocytochemical expression in negative and equivocal (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US)) liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples testing positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types with HC2 assay or polymerase-chain reaction (PCR). A series of 199 consecutive LBC specimens derived from the same number of women participating in the ongoing Latin American Screening Study at Leonor Mendes de Barros Hospital, Sao Paulo, were analyzed using immunocytochemistry for expression of p16 and Ki-67 in negative and equivocal LBC samples testing positive for high-risk HPV types with hybrid capture II test (HC2) or PCR. All patients with at least one test positive (cytology, PCR, and/or HC2) were followed each 6 months for 3 years. The follow-up procedure consisted of visual examination, colposcopic inspection, cytology, and HC2 assay. Among the negative cytologic samples, 101 were HPV-positive and 55 HPV-negative. Of the HPV-positive group, 59 of 101 cases (58.4%) were positive for both p16 and Ki67 immunostaining, and 17 of 101 (16.8%) were negative for both. The proportion of Ki-67-positivity increased almost in parallel with the increasing grade of p16-positivity (p = 0.0001 for linear trend). In the HPV-negative group, both markers were negative in 41 of 55 cases (74.5%), and no statistical relationship was observed between the two markers (Pearson, p = 0.595). HPV-positive ASC-US samples demonstrated a simultaneous positive immunoreaction for p16 and Ki67 in 11 of 16 cases (68.7%), whereas 3 (18.7%) were concurrently negative. The relationship between the two markers was of borderline significance (Pearson, p = 0.053), but no linear relationship was found between the graded p16 and Ki-67 expression (p = 0.065 for linear trend). In the HPV-negative ASC-US group, there was no statistical association between the graded p16 and Ki-67 positivity (Pearson, p = 0.281). After 36 months of follow-up of the ASC-US patients, 6 women still displayed ASC-US smear, of which 4 of 6 were HPV-positive and expressed both p16 and Ki-67 markers. Two of 43 ASC-US smears had high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions diagnosed (4.6%), and 1 had low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (2.3%). All of those were positive for HPV, p16 and Ki-67. Patients with ASC-US diagnosis and positive high-risk HPV status and positive for p16 Ki67 should be carefully observed to exclude occurrence of a squamous intraepithelial lesion. The combination of these two markers can be a useful implement for management of women with equivocal cytology."
CD008054,0,21214125,0,The role of human papillomavirus in common skin conditions: current viewpoints and therapeutic options.,"A direct causal relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical neoplasia is well-accepted, but the specific role of HPV in the pathogenesis of other cutaneous disorders is less clear. This article explores the role of HPV in 2 common disorders associated with considerable morbidity: external genital and perianal warts (EGWs) and actinic keratosis (AK). Because the potential role of HPV in the pathogenesis of EGW and AK may have implications that influence management, the available topical pharmacotherapy for each disorder also is reviewed. External genital and perianal warts represent a possible phenotypic expression of HPV infection and results from hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia of keratinocytes. The cell cycle disruption caused by low-risk anogenital HPV subtypes (eg, HPV-6, HPV-11) is similar to high-risk HPV subtypes, except low-risk HPV E6 and E7 proteins likely bind regulatory proteins with less affinity. Although UV light clearly has a primary causal role in the development of AK, new data suggest that HPV infection, particularly with 3-HPV subtypes, may serve as a cocarcinogen. By impairing normal DNA repair and apoptotic mechanisms, HPV may set the stage for later UV-induced transformation. It also has been suggested that HPV may increase the severity of AK lesions and contribute to their recurrence following therapy."
CD008054,0,10567897,0,Favorable clinical outcome of cervical cancers infected with human papilloma virus type 58 and related types.,"To determine whether the status of human-papillomavirus (HPV) infection affects the clinical outcome of cervical carcinoma (CC), HPV genotype was prospectively determined in 94 consecutive CC cases subsequently followed for a median duration of 37.5 months. With a consensus PCR-RFLP method of HPV genotyping, 81 (86.2%) cancers were positive for HPV DNA. They were classified, according to the phylogenic similarities, into HPV-16-related (type 16, n = 45; type 31, n = 2), HPV-58-related (type 58, n = 17; type 33, n = 3; type 52, n = 2) and HPV-18-related (type 18, n = 8; type 68, n = 1) groups, and analyzed in relation to clinical outcome. The following results were observed: (i) Type-58-related HPVs were more prevalent in the old age (older than the median age of 52) group than in the young age group (41% vs. 14.6%, p = 0.045); (ii) 63% (5/8) of patients with advanced stages (III and IV) were HPV-negative, a figure much higher than that (9.3%, 8/84) of patients with early stages (stage I and II) (p = 0.002); (iii) the occurrence of adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma was higher in the HPV-18-related group (50%) than in the HPV-16-related (33.3%) or the HPV-58-related (16.7%) groups (p = 0.024); (iv) the status of lymph-node metastasis and tumor grade did not correlate with HPV status; (v) 5-year survival rates were 90.2%, 80% and 74% for HPV-58-, HPV-16- and HPV-18-related groups, respectively (p = 0.03, after adjustment for tumor stage); (vi) in comparison with the HPV-16-related group, the relative risk of death in the HPV-58- and the HPV-18-related groups were 0.32 [95% CI, 0.07-1.49] and 1.87 [0.36-14.9] respectively. HPV genotype appears to affect the clinical behavior and outcome of cervical cancer. HPV-58-related types are prevalent in the older population, and appear to confer a favorable prognosis. Int. J. Cancer (Pred. Oncol.) 84:553-557, 1999."

CD008054,0,7819041,1,Human papillomavirus status in the prediction of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in patients with persistent low-grade cervical cytological abnormalities.,"The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) detection in the management of patients with persistent low-grade (mild dyskaryosis or less) cervical cytological abnormalities is unclear. We have analysed cytological material from 167 such patients both cytologically and by non-isotopic in situ hybridisation (NISH) for HPV 16, 18, 31 and 33 and consensus primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by both generic and specific typing for these HPV types. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3 was present in 40 of 167 patients (23.9%), and the positive predictive values (PPVs) for the presence of CIN 2 or 3, of moderate or severe dyskaryosis at repeat cytology and an HPV-positive NISH and generic PCR signal were 100%, 66% and 42% respectively. The corresponding sensitivities were 48%, 68% and 87%. Addition of cytology to molecular analysis improved both PPV and sensitivity, the best combination being NISH and cytopathology (PPV 71%, sensitivity 87%). These data demonstrate that the presence of CIN 2 or 3 in patients with mild cytological abnormalities can be predicted by molecular detection of HPV in some cases, particularly when combined with cytological analysis. However, the magnitude of this prediction is dependent on the population of patients studied, and the clinical role of this approach therefore remains to be defined."
CD008054,0,20946095,0,The impact of HAART on HPV-related cervical disease.,"highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has had an unequivocally positive impact on morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. These benefits have clearly extended to some HIV-related malignancies, including Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The impact of HAART on cervical cancer, however, remains uncertain. The objective of this review is to summarize the last ten years of registry-based and clinical research into the impact of HAART on human papillomavirus (HPV) related cervical disease."
CD008054,0,15899782,0,Evaluation of a modified reverse line blot assay for detection and typing of human papillomavirus.,"Detection and typing of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are requested by clinicians with growing frequency as part of the overall management of patients. A new method using consensus L1 amplification and a reverse line blot hybridization detection method has been described for broad spectrum HPV genotype identification. This method involves hybridization at 53 degrees C in a shaking water bath, which many laboratories might find cumbersome. We describe a modified hybridization step, using a dry-air incubator, that simplifies the detection protocol. Overall, comparable results were obtained by the modified, more easily performed protocol, indicating that laboratories might validate and use this modified method."
CD008054,0,19828739,1,Clinical performance of human papillomavirus E6 and E7 mRNA testing for high-grade lesions of the cervix.,"Infection with high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) is the major cause of cervical cancer. However, relatively few infections progress to malignant disease. Progression to malignancy requires the overexpression of the E6 and E7 genes in the integrated HPV genome. It follows that the E6 and E7 transcripts could be useful markers of disease progression. The study presented here tests this possibility, using data from colposcopy and from cytological and histological tests to compare RNA assays for the E6 and E7 genes with DNA testing. A total of 180 women underwent colposcopy, cytology, and biopsy of suspected lesions (143 cases). Cervical brush specimens were analyzed for HPV DNA and for E6 and E7 mRNA. DNA from HR HPV was found in 57.8% of the specimens; E6 and E7 transcripts were found in 45%. The rates of detection of HPV DNA and of E6 and E7 transcripts were 33.3% and 25%, respectively, for specimens with normal findings; 51.4% and 31.9%, respectively, for specimens with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1); and 61.1% and 44.2% for specimens with CIN2, respectively. All specimens with CIN3 and 95.5% of specimens from patients with squamous cell carcinoma were positive by both assays. Thirty-seven patients with normal colposcopy findings did not undergo biopsy. HPV DNA and mRNA transcripts were found in 32.4% and 18.9% of these cases, respectively. Comparisons with cytological tests produced similar results. Overall, the mRNA tests showed a higher specificity than the DNA tests for high-grade lesions (72.7% and 56.2%, respectively) and a higher positive predictive value (59.3% and 49.0%, respectively). These findings suggest that mRNA assays could be more powerful than DNA testing for predicting the risk of progression and offer a strong potential as a tool for triage and patient follow-up."
CD008054,0,18463361,0,Reducing the economic burden of HPV-related diseases.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a common sexually transmitted infection that is often acquired at the onset of sexual activity. Risk factors include younger age at time of sexual debut, sexual behavior, intact foreskin, and immunologic status. Persistent infection with high-risk oncogenic HPV types (especially 16 and 18) is associated with cervical cancer, other anogenital diseases, as well as some head and neck cancers. Infection with low-risk HPV types is associated with genital warts, low-grade dysplasias, and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Screening and management of HPV-related diseases incur high healthcare costs. Whereas routine screening of female patients with Papanicolaou tests helps prevent advanced stages of cancer through early detection and treatment, the recently developed HPV L1 capsid protein virus-like particle vaccines offer an option for prevention of HPV-related diseases, including cervical cancer."
CD008054,0,18620726,0,Is immunohistochemical epidermal growth factor receptor expression overestimated as a prognostic factor in head-neck squamous cell carcinoma? A retrospective analysis based on a tissue microarray of 365 carcinomas.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor is overexpressed in more than 80% of head-neck squamous cell carcinoma. Its role as an independent prognostic marker is discussed controversially. No standardized evaluation methods are reported. The aim of our study was to analyze the prognostic relevance of epidermal growth factor receptor expression, using a tissue microarray with more than 300 tumor samples. Epidermal growth factor receptor expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization based on a tissue microarray of 365 head-neck squamous cell carcinomas with complete clinicopathologic and follow-up data. Multiple independent observers blinded for clinical data evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor immunostaining semiquantitatively. Cut-off scores for positivity were determined systematically by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and validated by resampling of the data. Epidermal growth factor receptor expression cut-off scores for loco-regional relapse and overall survival were determined to be 60%. No significant correlation with clinicopathologic data was found. Independent significant differences in loco-regional control and overall survival could not be distinguished by epidermal growth factor receptor expression. Epidermal growth factor receptor expression could not be confirmed as a significant independent prognostic marker in head-neck squamous cell carcinoma using a large tissue microarray with 365 head-neck squamous cell carcinomas with complete clinical data, an evaluation based on immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization by multiple independent observers and systematic determination of cut-off scores."

During 2007, a Kentucky representative introduced legislation that would require HPV vaccination for all middle-school girls but allow parents to opt out for any reason. Evidence suggests that an HPV school requirement law would result in more Kentucky children being vaccinated than if there were no requirement law. However, this policy solution faced multiple factors that inhibited its ability to survive. Future proponents of HPV vaccine school requirement legislation can draw implications from Kentucky's experience. By building public support, undergoing a softening up period, and presenting a united, vocal front, proponents may be more likely to pass HPV vaccine legislation in the future."

CD008054,0,11179477,0,Mutation of the PTEN gene in advanced cervical cancer correlated with tumor progression and poor outcome after radiotherapy.,"Improvement in management of advanced cervical cancer after radiotherapy requires a better understanding of its biological behavior. PTEN/MMAC/TEP(PTEN), a candidate tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome 10q23.3, was recently identified and found to be frequently mutated in several different types of human tumors. In contrast, rare mutations of the PTEN gene have been reported in cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to determine whether mutation of PTEN leads to increased genomic alteration in advanced cervical carcinoma, and to identify the correlation between mutation of PTEN and patient outcome after radiotherapy. We examined 50 primary advanced cervical carcinomas (37 patients of Stage IIIB, 13 patients of Stage IVA) treated with definitive radiotherapy using a PCR-based assay followed by SSCP and direct sequencing. The PTEN gene was mutated in 8 of the 50 (16%) patients (2 of Stage III, and 6 of Stage IV). There was a significant difference in Stage III versus IV between the wild-type PTEN patients and mutant PTEN patients (P=0.002). The tumor size was 6+/-2.1 cm in the wild-type PTEN tumors versus 8.5+/-2 cm in the mutant PTEN tumors (P=0.009). In addition, there was a significant difference in survival between the wild-type PTEN patients and mutant PTEN patients (P=0.009). The results of this study suggest that the PTEN gene mutation rate increases with tumor progression, and that the PTEN gene may play a role in both progression of cervical carcinoma and treatment outcome."
CD008054,0,8763772,0,[Development of reconstruction techniques of the anterior skull base after tumor excision].,"183 benign and malignant tumors of the anterior cranial base were operated in the department of neurosurgery at Ste Anne's hospital, from June 1982 to December 1993. The bone defect was repaired first with bone sheets taken from the inner table of the cranial flap. Then allografts of irradiated bone and madreporic coral blocks were used as reconstruction material. Since January 1992, no bone reconstruction was performed; the anterior base was just covered with a sheet of Vicryl Composit Mesh (VCM) which was secured bilateraly on the pterion, the temporalis pars squamosa and around the ethmoid defect. This sheet of VCM reinforces the dural plane, which is always lined with a pediculated galea flap. These technical changes and evolution were motivated by: i/- a desire to simplify the surgical technique: ii/- the risk of transmission of viral diseases such as Creutzfeld Jacob disease by allografts, iii/- the frequency of splits and/or falls of madreporic coral grafts. Whatever the material, the infection risks were identical: 8% of subcutaneous and/or deep suppurations, 5% of post-operative meningitis. One patient presented with a transient clinical rhinorrhea."
CD008054,0,18191339,0,[Precancerous cervical lesions during pregnancy: diagnostic and treatment].,"The rate of CIN discovered during pregnancy is around 1%. Pregnancy should be a period for the checking of pap-smear. So a pap-smear should be performed if the last one is more than two years old. If the pap-smear is less than two years old, a copy of its result should be obtained. The cervical cytology is valid during pregnancy, and usually pregnancy induced an opening of the junction zone that helps to have a good evaluation of the cervix. When atypical cells are found in the pap-smear performed during pregnancy, the management should include a colposcopy and biopsies, whatever the severity of the abnormal cells (ASC-US, ASC-H, AGC, LBG, LHG, invasive carcinoma). The biopsy should be guided by the colposcopy. Biopsy is required for an optimal diagnosis. The management of the pregnant patient should be based on the results of cytology, and colposcopy and biopsies. Currently there is no indication for HPV-typing during pregnancy. If an invasive tumor is excluded after cytology, and colposcopy and biopsy, no treatment is performed during pregnancy, and the treatment is postponed after delivery following a complete cervical reevaluation. If an invasion cannot be excluded with the biopsy; a diagnostic conization completed with a cerclage should be performed. This procedure should be exceptionally performed. During pregnancy, CIN lesions are usually stable or regress; progression of CIN is rare. When managing an abnormal pap-smear during pregnancy, a microinvasive cervical cancer may be found on a biopsy or conization specimen. Staging of these lesions requires always a conization and eventually a pelvic MRI. Microinvasive cervical cancers can be only followed until the end of the pregnancy."
CD008054,0,18754286,1,HPV detection and genotyping as an earlier approach in cervical cancer screening of the female genital tract.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the leading risk factor for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. More than 100 virus genotypes have been identified so far, some of them strongly associated with the development of neoplasia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of the different HPV genotypes in women presenting no cytological alterations in cervical cells, in women presenting light alterations, and in women presenting severe alterations at routine gynecological examination. We retrospectively analyzed 97 HPV results of women submitted to cervical cancer screening compared to their Papanicolaou and colposcopy examinations. Data were analyzed individually and within groups to correlate the HPV genotypes identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the respective alterations in cervical cells. Among the nine cases diagnosed as CIN I (9.3%), two were positive for low-risk HPV genotypes (22%), and the other seven were negative for HPV by PCR (78%). CIN II or CIN III diagnoses were associated with positive HPV results by PCR in four cases (36%), for high-risk as well as low-risk genotypes. There were two patients with severe cytological alterations in cervical cells, but with an indeterminate HPV genotype (18%), and one case with a negative HPV result (9%). Among the 57 cases without cytological alterations, seven were positive for low-risk HPV (12%) and two for high-risk HPV genotypes (3.5%). In the 48 remaining cases, we observed one with an indeterminate HPV genotype (2%), and the other 47 were negative for HPV by PCR (47%). Our study demonstrates an important prevalence of high- and low-risk HPV genotypes in our population, including those not present in the commercially available vaccine, even in patients with no evidence of cytological alterations in cervical cells. These results highlight the usefulness of HPV detection and typing as an early approach for cervical cancer screening and prevention."
CD008054,0,15126331,0,Promoter hypermethylation of FANCF: disruption of Fanconi Anemia-BRCA pathway in cervical cancer.,"Patients with advanced stage invasive cervical cancer (CC) exhibit highly complex genomic alterations and respond poorly to conventional treatment protocols. In our efforts to understand the molecular genetic basis of CC, we examined the role of Fanconi Anemia (FA)-BRCA pathway. Here, we show that FANCF gene is disrupted by either promoter hypermethylation and/or deregulated gene expression in a majority of CC. Inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylases induces FANCF gene re-expression in CC cell lines. FANCF-deregulated CC cell lines also exhibit a chromosomal hypersensitivity phenotype after exposure to an alkylating agent, a characteristic of FA patients. We also show the involvement of BRCA1 gene by promoter hypermethylation or down-regulated expression in a small subset of CC patients. Thus, we have found inactivation of genes in the FA-BRCA pathway by epigenetic alterations in a high proportion of CC patients, suggesting a major role for this pathway in the development of cervical cancer. Thus, these results have important implications in understanding the molecular basis of CC tumorigenesis and clinical management in designing targeted experimental therapeutic protocols."

It included 155 newly referred adolescents (age < or = 20 years) with abnormal smear results. The aim of the study was to define the demographic risk factors associated with the development of abnormal cervical smears and identify the incidence of high-grade cervical lesions in this age group. All the risk factors associated with development of HPV infection were found among this group, particularly early age of sexual contact and number of sexual partners. A total of 52.9% of the cases had a smear showing moderate or severe dyskaryosis. The incidence increased to 66.7% among those who had their first sexual contact before the age of 16. Colposcopy and histology confirmed the presence of CIN II and CIN III in 40.6% of cases. The study showed that patients can develop high-grade cervical lesions in their early teens. Delaying the age of onset of cervical screening to 25, as it is currently recommended in UK, will delay the detection and treatment of these cases.

CD008054,0,11259094,0,Addition of high-risk HPV testing improves the current guidelines on follow-up after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"We assessed a possible role for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in the policy after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3 (moderate to severe dysplasia). According to the Dutch guidelines follow-up after treatment consists of cervical cytology at 6, 12 and 24 months. Colposcopy is only performed in case of abnormal cervical cytology. In this observational study 184 women treated for CIN 2 or 3 were prospectively monitored by cervical cytology and high-risk HPV testing 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months after treatment. Post-treatment CIN 2/3 was present in 29 women (15.8%). A positive high-risk HPV test 6 months after treatment was more predictive for post-treatment CIN 2/3 than abnormal cervical cytology (sensitivity 90% and 62% respectively, with similar specificity). At 6 months the negative predictive value of a high-risk HPV negative, normal smear, was 99%. Largely overlapping, partly different groups of women with post-treatment CIN 2/3 were identified by HPV testing and cervical cytology. Based on these results we advocate to include high-risk HPV testing in monitoring women initially treated for CIN 2/3. In case of a high-risk HPV positive test or abnormal cervical cytology, colposcopy is indicated. All women should be tested at 6 and 24 months after treatment and only referred to the population-based cervical cancer screening programme when the tests are negative on both visits."

Women with primary invasive cervical cancer had a relative risk of 4.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.4-8.1) for subsequent invasive anal cancer. Increased relative risks after cervical cancer were also found for cancers of the oral cavity (relative risk (RR) = 2.2), stomach (RR = 1.5), rectum (RR = 1.4), larynx (RR = 3.4), lung (RR = 3.0), vagina (RR = 5.6), bladder (RR = 2.7), for kidney (RR = 1.9); decreased relative risks were noted for melanoma (RR = 0.5) and breast cancer (RR = 0.8). Patients with a primary diagnosis of anal cancer had relative risks for subsequent invasive and in situ cervical cancer of 1.3 (95% CI 0.2-4.5) and 3.4 (95% CI 0.9-8.8), respectively. Anal cancer was also associated with increased relative risks of subsequent lung (RR = 2.5) and prostate (RR = 1.8) cancers, whereas the relative risk of uterine cancer was 0.2 (95% CI 0.0-0.9).

CD008054,0,7490162,0,Building up a computerized follow-up register and information system for cervical cytology.,"It is well known that cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection are closely related to cervical cancer. The cervical cytology examination (pap-test), followed by a colposcopic examination and a biopsy are the common tools for the early detection and the establishment of diagnosis of the cervical precancerous lesions. The monitoring and surveillance of those precancerous lesions is essential for the prevention of cervical cancer and for effective patient management. Nowadays, the long-term care of patients with a chronic and/or serious disease is feasible with the use of computerized follow-up registers or through more complex information systems. Nevertheless, manual recording is still the predominant method of data collection in 'Alexandra' University Hospital and this is the case in most health services in Greece due to scarcity of resources.

Comparative empirical data were obtained in 1996-2001 from a cohort study of female university students in Montreal, Canada. Female prevalence and frequency of sexual intercourse and condom use were set equal to those in the cohort. Simulations included 240 combinations of male prevalence, the relative risk for protected versus unprotected sex, and per-act transmission probabilities. Those that produced expected HPV incidence within the 95% confidence interval observed in the cohort were selected. The observed 6-month cumulative incidence following acquisition of a new partner was 17.0% (95% confidence interval: 11.4, 23.0). Expected incidences consistent with those from cohort findings occurred in 54/240 simulations. The range of per-act transmission probabilities was 5-100% (median, 40%). Male HPV prevalence was the same as or greater than that for women in all consistent simulations. Varying condom effectiveness did not produce better-fitting data. This simulation suggests that HPV transmissibility is several-fold higher than that for other viral sexually transmitted infections such as human immunodeficiency virus or herpes simplex virus 2. With high transmissibility, any potential protective effect of condoms would disappear over multiple intercourse acts, underlining the need for an effective HPV vaccine."
CD008054,0,12060450,0,Immunohistochemical evaluation is not prognostic for recurrence in fully staged high-risk endometrial cancer.,"The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of common immunohistochemical pathologic risk factors in fully staged high-risk endometrial cancers. Sixty-two of 265 consecutive endometrioid adenocarcinomas were considered high risk for recurrence because of deep myometrial invasion and poor differentiation (stage IC, G3), cervical metastasis (stage II), ovarian metastasis (stage IIIA) or lymph node metastasis (stage IIIC). All patients underwent complete surgical staging with bilateral pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy. Expression of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, p53, HER-2/neu, c-myc, bcl-2, FVIII, and Ki-67 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using commercially available monoclonal antibodies. A general linear model multiple regression analysis was used to determine if any of the immunostains, along with grade or stage, were predictors of recurrence. Mean age was 68 years and mean weight 188 pounds. Sixty-eight percent of patients had associated medical illness. The majority of tumors were poorly differentiated (44%) and were stage IIIC (29%). Mean follow-up was 4.3 years. Fourteen patients (22%) developed tumor recurrence. Using multiple regression analysis, none of the immunostains were predictive for recurrence (P = 0.19-.96). Only stage and grade were predictive of tumor recurrence (P = 0.04,.02).

The original, paraffin-embedded vulvar specimens were examined by the polymerase chain reaction for human papillomavirus DNA of the types HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, and 33. HPV types 16 and 33 were found in 90% of the VIN lesions. It is concluded that VIN III is an HPV-related disease in all or almost all cases, and that a generalized genital HPV infection may be a factor in the development of multicentric genital neoplasia. No association was observed between the specific HPV type and the risk of recurrent vulvar disease, cervical neoplasia, or malignant progression."

Although there are several typing methods, it is still unclear which test is the best. This study compared the effectiveness of type-specific PCR (TS-PCR) and sequencing, with a focus on their clinical application. A total of 260 cervical samples from HPV-positive patients were tested for types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33 and 35 using TS-PCR and sequencing. The genotype was identified in 36% of cases by TS-PCR and in 75% by sequencing. Sequencing was four times more likely to identify the viral type in positive samples than TS-PCR (p = 0.00). Despite being more effective for virus genotyping, sequencing was unable to identify viral types in multiple infections. Combining both techniques resulted in highly sensitive detection (87% of cases), showing that they are complementary methods. HPV genotyping is an important step in HPV management, helping to identify patients with a higher risk of developing cervical cancer and contributing to the development of type-specific vaccines."

Their incidence is expected to increase as the survival period of patients with AIDS lengthens. Also, the cost of antiretroviral therapies poses a limit to the development of successful global intervention to tackle the worldwide spreading of AIDS, that, by the year 2000, will affect 40 million individuals. Some 90% of these new infections are occurring in developing countries, which can not afford the cost of antiretroviral therapies, and are not able to ensure a proper follow up of patients with AIDS. In addition, cultural and ethical problems make difficult the achievement of an adequate education of how to prevent the spreading of AIDS among populations of poorer countries. On these grounds, the field of AIDS research is evaluating alternative therapeutic approaches for the treatment and prevention of AIDS."

CD008054,0,7837123,0,Subclinical cervicovaginal human papillomavirus infections associated with cervical condylomata and dysplasia. Treatment outcomes.,"Seventy-seven women with subclinical cervicovaginal human papillomavirus (HPV) changes associated with cervical condylomata and/or mild or moderate cervical dysplasia were studied. All patients were treated with the CO2 laser for cervical lesions (condylomata and/or dysplasia) and, subsequently, based on their contraceptive history, were treated either with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream or trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Those who did not wish to be treated were followed similarly to those who were treated. Overall there was no significant difference between those who had no treatment and those who received TCA or 5-FU. Those treated with 5-FU did more poorly as compared to the other two treatment groups with cervical condylomata and dysplasia at the three- and six-month follow-up (P < .05), and the results for TCA were not different from those in women who were observed and underwent no treatment. It appears that the treatment modalities used in this study did not have any beneficial effect on associated subclinical HPV infections."
CD008054,0,21064091,0,Type-specific HPV geno-typing improves detection of recurrent high-grade cervical neoplasia after conisation.,"The aim of this case-control study was to examine if type-specific human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA geno-typing before and after treatment of high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) improves prediction of recurring or persisting CIN 2 or 3 compared with follow-up cytology or high-risk (hr)HPV testing. Women with biopsy-proven recurrence of CIN 2 or 3 (cases) in a follow-up period of at least 24 months after treatment of high-grade CIN were compared with women without recurrence (controls). These cohorts were identified by a database search of the Riatol Laboratoria (Antwerp, Belgium). In a cohort of 823 women treated with conisation for high-grade CIN between January 2001 and December 2007, 21 patients with a histologically proven recurrence of CIN2+ were identified. A group of women (n=42) from the same cohort without recurrence was randomly chosen. We found that hrHPV testing at 6 months post-treatment is significantly more sensitive compared with follow-up cytology (ratio: 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.54), but less specific (ratio: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.81-0.90) to predict failure of treatment. When compared with hrHPV testing, HPV geno-typing is more efficient (equal sensitivity, but higher specificity, ratio: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.280-1.62). When compared with follow-up cytology, HPV geno-typing is more sensitive (ratio: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.10-1.54) and more specific (ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.14-1.36). All women who developed a recurrence tested positive for hrHPV. The negative predictive value in the absence of hrHPV DNA was 100%. Six months after treatment HPV geno-typing is the most sensitive and specific method to predict recurrent or persistent CIN 2-3 in the next 24 months."
CD008054,0,21064095,0,Persistent human papillomavirus DNA is associated with local recurrence after radiotherapy of uterine cervical cancer.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA is considered as a hallmark of cervical cancer. We investigated whether persistent HPV DNA at the cervix is associated with local recurrence after radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. A total of 156 patients with HPV-positive cervical cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB-IVB) treated with radiotherapy between July 2003 and December 2006 were analyzed. HPV DNA was measured prior to radiotherapy and after completion of radiotherapy. The results of HPV DNA test at postradiotherapy 1, 3, 6 and 12 months were analyzed individually for association with local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). In addition, the result of any last follow-up HPV test within 24 months postradiotherapy was defined as the overall status of HPV at 24 months and was also analyzed for association with LRFS. HPV DNA was cleared in 127 patients (81.4%) and persistent in 29 patients (18.6%) by 24 months. In 18 patients with local recurrences, 14 patients (78%) showed positive HPV tests at 1-3 months. Among the various time points analyzed, a positive HPV test at 3 months was the most accurate predictor of local recurrence. Multivariate analysis indicated that overall status of HPV at 24 months, low HPV viral load and histologic grade as being significantly related to poor LRFS. In HPV-positive cervical carcinoma treated primarily with radiotherapy, persistent HPV DNA within 24 months after treatment indicates a high risk of local recurrence. Diagnostic accuracy of HPV test was highest at 3 months."
CD008054,0,14584642,0,The current status of HPV DNA testing.,"Infection with high-risk types of HPV underlies most cases of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and practically all cases of invasive cervical cancer. Currently, cervical HPV DNA is detected by means of PCR and sandwich capture molecular hybridization methods. Research has focused on the potential role of HPV testing in three conditions: screening for cervical neoplasia, triage of women with low-grade lesions and follow-up after conservative surgical treatment for CIN. Concerning the first condition, HPV testing does not seem to offer an obvious advantage over traditional cytology screening, mainly due to false positive results in younger women with transient HPV infection. A possible exemption to this is the case of middle-aged women and low-resource settings, where the excellent sensitivity of a HPV test is desirable. Although data are controversial regarding low grade lesions, results from randomized studies indicate that HPV testing could be useful in a triage of women with an initial cytological diagnosis of ASCUS, where detection of DNA of a high-risk type should lead to colposcopy. Although there is a lack of randomized controlled trials in this field, data from observational studies indicate that HPV DNA testing after conservative surgical treatment for CIN may be very sensitive and detect early residual and recurrent disease."

CD008054,0,20397551,0,Vaccination for tomorrow: the need to improve immunisation rates.,"Since the 1998 health scare about measles mumps and rubella (MMR) immunisation, vaccination rates for measles have suffered. Although these recovered for a brief period in 2004-05, they have stalled again and latest figures suggest that only 85% of children are now immunised against this disease. The UK has become one of the five countries in the European Union with the highest measles rates. Meanwhile the wider picture indicates that other vaccination rates, including for seasonal influenza, are not meeting targets. This is a potential sign that the MMR scare and myths around immunisation are setting a worrying trend of some people losing confidence in the practice of vaccination. The UK has expanded its childhood immunisation programme to include the human papilloma virus vaccine (HPV) which protects against some types of cervical cancer. New life-saving vaccines for diseases, including meningococcal B meningitis (a strain of meningitis not yet covered by the existing vaccination programme), shingles and hepatitis C will soon become available. It is therefore important that information is available to the general public about the excellent safety record and benefits of vaccination to ensure that as many people as possible can take advantage of these new vaccines. This article explores the current uptake of, and attitudes towards, vaccination programmes and discusses some myths about immunisation. It suggests that community health care teams with access to adults, including parents of children and young people who need vaccination, are well placed to help challenge some of these myths and promote the benefits of immunisation. Practical suggestions are included on how this can be achieved."

The number of referrals due to minor smear abnormalities more than doubled from 8.6% to 22.3% of the total colposcopy referrals over the 4 year period studied. The minor smear abnormalities were only associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in patients aged < 50 years. In 19 (13.5%) of the 141 patients high-grade lesions (CIN II or CIN III) were diagnosed. There were no cases of invasive cancer. Furthermore, the increased number of patients being referred for colposcopy with minor cervical smear abnormalities highlights the increasing pressures on colposcopy services, with prolonged waiting times for all patients."

CD008054,0,11076670,0,Sexual behaviour and smoking as determinants of cervical HPV infection and of CIN3 among those infected: a case-control study nested within the Manchester cohort.,"To distinguish risk factors for acquisition of cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infection from the determinants of neoplasia among infected individuals we have conducted a three-arm case-control study nested within a large population-based cohort of women (the Manchester cohort) screened for HPV at entry using L1 consensus primer PCR. The study includes 181 HPV-positive controls who did not develop high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) during follow-up, 203 HPV-negative controls, and 199 HPV-positive cases with histologically confirmed CIN3. Detailed information on sexual, reproductive and gynaecological history, oral contraceptive use and smoking was obtained at face-to-face interview. There was a striking division between risk factors for infection and those predictive of disease. Comparing the HPV-positive against the HPV-negative controls, the only risk factors for infection were number of sexual partners (OR for six or more = 3.89; 95% Cl = 1.99-7.62), a relatively recent new sexual relationship (OR for a new partner within the previous 2 years = 4.17; 95% Cl = 2.13-8.33), and a history of previous miscarriage (OR = 2.59; 95% Cl = 1.28-5.21). The determinants of CIN3 among infected women were, in contrast, early age at first intercourse (OR for 16 years old or less = 3.23; 95% Cl = 1.33-7.69), a long time since starting a new sexual relationship (OR for 6 years or more = 4.94; 95% Cl = 2.51-9.71), and cigarette smoking, with strong evidence for a dose- response (OR for current smoking habit 20+ per day = 2.57; 95% Cl = 1.49-4.45). Oral contraceptive use was not significantly associated with either HPV infection or CIN3."

CD008054,0,7737583,0,HPV DNA positivity and natural killer cell activity in the clinical outcome of mild cervical dysplasia: integration between virus and immune system.,"The objective was to examine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA infection in mild cervical dysplasia and to evaluate longitudinally the persistence of HPV DNA positivity in an observational study, aiming at identifying the role of peripheral blood lymphocyte natural killer activity in the natural history of dysplastic disease. Twenty-three patients with histologically proven mild cervical dysplasia were selected. The HPV DNA positivity, determined by polymerase chain reaction, and cervical dysplasia were monitored cytologically and colposcopically at the 3rd (time 1), 6th (time 2) and 12th months (time 3), and defined by biopsies for routine histology taken at times 2 and 3. For each patient included in the study, the immune reactivity was evaluated at the time of diagnosis and afterwards, longitudinally during the follow-up. The immune status analysis included T lymphocyte subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, CD16 monoclonal antibodies by Beckton Dickinson, Mountain View, Calif., USA) and determinations of natural killer cell activity (against the sensitive cell line K 562). Eighteen out of the 23 women with mild cervical dysplasia (78.3%) were found positive for HPV DNA, with a significantly high representation of HPV DNA type 16 (55.6% of cases). At the end of the study, 12 out of 18 HPV-DNA-positive women became negative (defined by two or more negative tests) for the original HPV DNA type, with 66.7% of spontaneous HPV DNA negativization rate (p = 0.6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Both patients presented with a bloody foul-smelling vaginal discharge. Speculum examination confirmed cervical ulceration, prompting the diagnosis of cervical carcinoma in both patients. Cervical punch biopsies confirmed the characteristic features of GI; granulation tissue containing a dense plasma cell infiltrate, aggregates of neutrophils, and vacuolated enlarged histiocytes containing Donovan bodies were noted. Many of these histiocytes and sheets of von Hansemann cells contained intracytoplasmic Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, confirming concomitant malacoplakia. Michaelis-Gutmann bodies were also present in extracellular locations. Ultrastructural examination confirmed these histopathologic findings. One patient died of disseminated tuberculosis before treatment was initiated. The other patient did not return for a follow-up visit of her cervical lesion. Concomitant GI and malacoplakia is unreported in genital and extragenital sites; Klebsiella granulomatis must therefore be added to the list of bacteria associated with malacoplakia. Malacoplakia of the female genital tract is documented rarely and remains unreported, to date, in AIDS patients. Similar to the pathogenetic mechanisms described for AIDS-associated malacoplakia in extragenital sites, it is hypothesized that, in addition to abnormal macrophage functioning and an inability to degrade bacteria, special constituents of K. granulomatis are undigestable by lysosomal enzymes in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients."

CD008054,0,19065484,0,Histopathology of Barrett's esophagus after ablation and endoscopic mucosal resection therapy.,"This review focuses on the histopathological evaluation of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) specimens in Barrett's esophagus, and on the histopathological, biological, and molecular properties of postablation Barrett's esophagus. EMR may be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Diagnostic accuracy regarding the grade and stage of neoplasms is improved with the use of EMR, but the value of this technique for treatment is more controversial because of the high prevalence rate of positive margins and the rate of metachronous lesions found elsewhere in the esophagus during follow-up. Ablation techniques, such as argon plasma coagulation, photodynamic therapy, and radiofrequency ablation, are used increasingly for the treatment of Barrett's esophagus and related neoplasms, often in combination with EMR. A common problem after use of these techniques is the development of islands of neosquamous epithelium (NSE) which can overlie buried Barrett's (and/or dysplasia) epithelium. This is, therefore, concealed to the endoscopist's view and may be allowed to progress to cancer without detection. NSE is histologically similar to normal esophageal squamous epithelium and does not possess the molecular aberrations characteristic of Barrett's esophagus. In contrast, residual nonburied Barrett's esophagus shows persistent pathologic and molecular abnormalities and may progress to cancer upon long term follow-up. The biological potential and rate of progression of nonburied residual Barrett's esophagus following ablation is unclear, but some preliminary studies suggest that the risk may decrease. Buried nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus appears to show decreased biological potential and this may be related to protection from the contents of the lumen by the barrier function of the overlying NSE. On the other hand, anecdotal reports have suggested that buried dysplasia may progress to cancer in some instances."

CD008054,0,9466653,0,International trends in the incidence of cervical cancer: I. Adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous cell carcinomas.,"Time trends in the incidence of cervical adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous cell carcinomas during the period 1973-1991 were examined using data provided by 60 population-based cancer registries from 32 defined populations in 25 countries. Three components of the incidence trend were studied: age, calendar period of diagnosis and birth cohort. Cumulative incidence rates per 1,000 for 2 groups with age ranges 25-49 and 50-74 years were calculated from the model that best described the incidence data. There was a significant increase in the cumulative incidence of cervical adenocarcinomas in women born in the mid-1930s and in successive cohorts thereafter in some populations in the United States (whites and Hispanic women), Australia, New Zealand (non-Maori), England, Scotland, Denmark, Slovenia, Slovakia and Japan (Osaka) and among Chinese women in Singapore, with a general decline in the incidence in women born in earlier periods. In Sweden and Slovenia there is a suggestion of an increasing trend in both age groups. A decrease in incidence in both age groups was apparent in Finland, France and Italy. There were no changes in incidence in 24 registries covering other European, Asian and black populations in the United States. Part of the increase may be attributable to an increasing prevalence of human papillomavirus infection, and part to improvements in screening."
CD008054,0,19839054,0,Nuclear receptors in head and neck cancer: current knowledge and perspectives.,"Disease management of head and neck cancer has improved significantly. However, a high rate of early recurrences and metastasis still counteract improvement of long-term survival. Hence, the quest for molecular mechanisms and key regulatory factors exploitable by targeted therapies is still ongoing. Such potential candidates may include also nuclear receptors, belonging to a superfamily of transcription factors implicated in a broad spectrum of physiological and pathophysiological processes. As dysfunction of nuclear receptor signaling contributes to a variety of proliferative diseases, they are major targets for drug discovery and hold promising potential for the development of improved anticancer treatment strategies. Several nuclear receptors have also been associated with head and neck cancer, and strategies targeting these molecules are currently tested in clinical trials. However, reports and molecular knowledge on the pathobiological relevance of nuclear receptors for cancers of the head and neck is currently rather fragmented. Hence, this review provides a general overview of nuclear receptors' molecular functions and summarizes their potential prognostic and therapeutic relevance for this tumor entity."

The utility of reflexive HPV DNA testing for women with a cytologic diagnosis of atypical glandular cells-not otherwise specified (AGC-NOS), ASCUS subtypes, and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) has not been well established. In the present investigation, reflex Hybrid Capture II HPV DNA testing results were evaluated for HPV prevalence and type in 371 women with abnormal cytologic diagnoses of ASCUS-not otherwise specified (ASCUS-NOS), ASCUS-suspicious for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASCUS-L), atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), AGC-NOS, and LSIL on ThinPrep Pap tests. Positive high-risk HPV DNA was identified in 53.6% of the study samples, including ASCUS-NOS 40.2% ASCUS-L 71.4%, ASC-H 37.5%, LSIL 88.6%, and AGC-NOS 0%.

CD008054,0,10534162,0,Atypical immature metaplastic-like proliferations of the cervix: diagnostic reproducibility and viral (HPV) correlates.,"Although some immature squamous lesions (papillary immature metaplasias) of the cervix have been described and associated with human papillomaviruses (HPV), nonpapillary atypical immature squamous proliferations (AISPs) are a poorly defined entity and range from atypical reactive metaplasias to squamous intraepithelial lesions resembling immature metaplasia. This study examined the diagnostic reproducibility of AISPs and their relationship to HPV nucleic acids. Forty-four diagnostically problematic AISPs were studied. Based on nuclear density (crowding), chromasia, variation (anisokaryosis) in nuclear size, and surface cytoplasmic maturation, cases were independently scored by 2 observers as (1) probably reactive (Rx), (2) not otherwise specified (NOS), and (3) squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). Extracted archival DNA was scored for HPV by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Interobserver reproducibility (kappa statistic) and HPV correlates (chi square) were computed. Approximately one third of cases were classified in each category by the observers. Interobserver reproducibility was excellent (0.80), poor (0.23), and fair to good (0.41) for a diagnosis of Rx, NOS, and SIL, respectively. Differences in HPV DNA positivity between Rx and SIL were significant for both observers (5.8% to 6.7% v 38.4% to 50.0%, respectively); however, differences between NOS and SIL (30.7% to 42.8% v 38.4% to 50.0%) were not, even when cases were limited to those in which both observers agreed (28.6% v 37.5%). By light microscopy, AISPs exceeding the threshold for presumed reactive changes (NOS or SIL) are a morphologically heterogeneous group that defy precise classification. Furthermore, their histopathologic appearance, even when there is diagnostic agreement, does not consistently correlate with their HPV status. The laboratory management of AISPs should take into account the uncertainty of this diagnosis."
CD008054,0,20361539,1,The relationship between HPV16 and HPV18 viral load and cervical lesions progression.,"Cervical cancer remains one of the most important mortality causes worldwide. It is already known that high risk HPV (HR-HPV) has the main role in the development of pre- or cancerous lesions. Despite the fact that many studies focused on the HR-HPV viral loads as possible biomarkers, the viral load quantification utility for all HR-HPV genotypes is still a controversy. The purpose of our study was to determine if HPV16 and 18 viral load values might be a potential marker for HPV infection clearance versus of pre- and cancerous lesions development."
CD008054,0,12918067,0,A comprehensive natural history model of HPV infection and cervical cancer to estimate the clinical impact of a prophylactic HPV-16/18 vaccine.,"The object of our study is to project the impact of a prophylactic vaccine against persistent human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 infection on age-specific incidence of invasive cervical cancer. We developed a computer-based mathematical model of the natural history of cervical carcinogenesis to incorporate the underlying type-specific HPV distribution within precancerous lesions and invasive cancer. After defining plausible ranges for each parameter based on a comprehensive literature review, the model was calibrated to the best available population-based data. We projected the age-specific reduction in cervical cancer that would occur with a vaccine that reduced the probability of acquiring persistent infection with HPV 16/18, and explored the impact of alternative assumptions about vaccine efficacy and coverage, waning immunity and competing risks associated with non-16/18 HPV types in vaccinated women. The model predicted a peak age-specific cancer incidence of 90 per 100,000 in the 6th decade, a lifetime cancer risk of 3.7% and a reproducible representation of type-specific HPV within low and high-grade cervical precancerous lesions and cervical cancer. A vaccine that prevented 98% of persistent HPV 16/18 was associated with an approximate equivalent reduction in 16/18-associated cancer and a 51% reduction in total cervical cancer; the effect on total cancer was attenuated due to the competing risks associated with other oncogenic non-16/18 types. A vaccine that prevented 75% of persistent HPV 16/18 was associated with a 70% to 83% reduction in HPV-16/18 cancer cases. Similar effects were observed with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) although the impact of vaccination on the overall prevalence of HPV and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) was minimal. In conclusion, a prophylactic vaccine that prevents persistent HPV-16/18 infection can be expected to significantly reduce HPV-16/18-associated LSIL, HSIL and cervical cancer. The impact on overall prevalence of HPV or LSIL, however, may be minimal. Based on the relative importance of different parameters in the model, several priorities for future research were identified. These include a better understanding of the heterogeneity of vaccine response, the effect of type-specific vaccination on other HPV types and the degree to which vaccination effect persists over time."
CD008054,0,20028865,0,Diagnosing cervical cancer and high-grade precursors by HPV16 transcription patterns.,"Infections with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV), mainly HPV type 16, can cause malignant transformation of the human cervical epithelium and the development of cervical cancer (CxCa). A rapid and precise diagnosis of the precancerous lesions by conventional cytology or HPV DNA tests remains difficult and often leads to overtreatment. We quantitatively analyzed the HPV16 transcriptome of 80 HPV16 DNA-positive cervical scrapes classified as mild cytologic grade, including no intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NIL/M; normal, n=25) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL; n=24), and severe cytologic grade, including high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL; n=24) and CxCa (n=7), with novel nucleic acid sequence-based amplification-Luminex assays. In severe lesions, HPV16 E6*II and E1C encoding transcripts were strongly upregulated, whereas spliced E1[SYMBOL: SEE TEXT]E4 and L1 encoding transcripts were markedly downregulated. Using a combination of the four marker transcripts, 100% of CxCa and 67% of HSIL cases were correctly identified as severe, and 74% of LSIL and 92% of NIL/M samples as mild cytologic grade. Compared with a commercially available HPV E6/E7 mRNA assay, the specificity of the marker combination for discriminating severe and mild cytologic lesions increased from 23% to 83%. In conclusion, we identified a novel HPV16 RNA pattern for grading of cervical lesions with a potentially high diagnostic value for the primary screening of CxCa precursors and the triage of cervical lesions."

CD008054,0,11263596,0,Familial risks in invasive and in situ cervical cancer by histological type.,"The Swedish Family-Cancer Database was used to analyse familial relationships in mothers and daughters with invasive and in situ cervical cancers by histological type during the years 1958-1996, including a total of 21,727 and 191,081 cases, respectively. Familial standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated separately for mothers and daughters and for invasive and in situ squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma. Familial risks were about 2.0 in invasive SCC and less in in situ SCC. Limited analyses could be carried out on adenocarcinoma because the number of cases was small. However, familial risks were not much smaller in families where only SCC was diagnosed compared with those where both SCC and adenocarcinoma were present. A comparison of cancers between mothers and daughters showed an association between cervical cancer and SCC of skin, and between cervical cancer and smoking-related cancers. The familial risks were unaffected in Poisson regression analysis on many possible intervening variables. The data suggest that host factors modulate an individual's response to human papillomavirus infections."
CD008054,0,1327058,0,Genital warts--therapy.,The main goal of the therapy of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the management of the virus. There is no cure for HPV infections. The treatment goal for the female patient is to destroy lesions that are malignant or premalignant. The male patient is treated because he is a carrier of HPV who can infect previously uninfected women and possibly reinfect an already treated partner with a potentially oncogenic virus. Various treatment modalities are discussed.
CD008054,0,16794238,0,Cancer in 15- to 29-year-olds by primary site.,"Cancer occurring between the ages of 15 and 30 years is 2.7 times more common than cancer occurring during the first 15 years of life, yet is much less common than cancer in older age groups, and accounts for just 2% of all invasive cancer. Cancer in adolescents and young adults is unique in the distribution of the types that occur. Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, testis cancer, female genital tract malignancies, thyroid cancer, soft-tissue sarcomas, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, brain and spinal cord tumors, breast cancer, bone sarcomas, and nongonadal germ cell tumors account for 95% of the cancers in this age group. The frequency distribution of cancer types changes dramatically from age 15-30, such that the pattern at the youngest age does not resemble the one at the oldest. The incidence of cancer in this age group increased steadily during the past quarter century. This increase is declining and at the older end of the age range appears to be returning to the incidence of the 1970s. Males in the 15- to 29-year age group have been at higher risk of developing cancer, with the risk directly proportional to age. Non-Hispanic whites have had the highest risk of developing cancer during this phase of life, and Asians, American Indians and Native Alaskans the lowest. Males had a worse prognosis than females. African-Americans, American Indian/Alaska Natives had a worse prognosis than white non-Hispanics and Asians. MORTALITY & SURVIVAL: At the beginning of the last quarter century, the diagnosis of cancer in 15- to 29-year-olds carried a more favorable prognosis, on the average, relative to cancer at other ages. Since then, there has been a lack of progress in survival improvement among older adolescents and young adults relative to all other ages. Survival improvement trends portend a worse prognosis for young adults diagnosed with cancer today than 25 years ago. The survival deficit is increasing with longer follow-up of the survivors, and is worse in males. Among 15- to 29-year-olds, non-Hispanic whites had the best survival and African Americans/blacks had the worst survival, with a 20% difference apparent by 5 years. Asians/Pacific Islanders had the second best survival, with Hispanics and American Indians/Alaska Natives next in sequence."

CD008054,0,19150107,0,Molecular and phenotypic analysis of poorly differentiated sinonasal neoplasms: an integrated approach for early diagnosis and classification.,"Primary poorly differentiated (small round and non-small) sinonasal neoplasms comprise histogenetically and biologically diverse entities with overlapping morphologic features. Because of the limited initial biopsy tissue materials, differential diagnostic difficulties may arise and complicate timely management of some cases. We used immunohistochemical and molecular marker analyses in a large cohort of these tumors to optimize their early diagnosis and classification. Fifty-two tumors of the skull base and sinonasal regions and, for comparison, 19 poorly differentiated neoplasms of other head and neck sites were analyzed by a panel of immunohistochemical markers including those of epithelial, mesenchymal, melanocytic, and neuroectodermal origin using tissue microarray. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of messenger RNA for EWS-FLI1 and PAX-FKHR fusion transcripts and the human achaete-scute homolog-1 gene was performed on 24 of the 52 sinonasal tumors and the 19 tumors of other sites for comparison. The immunohistochemical results substantiated the phenotypic assessment and the initial diagnosis in 49 of the 52 tumors. In 4 instances the integrated markers and phenotypic analyses led to reclassification of 3 tumors and confirmed the histogenesis of a mesenchymal tumor with aberrant cytokeratin expression. Molecular analysis of the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene transcript revealed 4 (9.3%) of the 43 tumors to be positive; all were Ewing sarcomas. The human achaete-scute homolog-1 gene transcript was identified in 10 (23.8%) of 42 tumors: 3 of 6 neuroblastomas, all 4 neuroendocrine carcinomas, and 1 each in sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and melanoma. The PAX-FKHR fusion transcript was not detected in any tumors. We conclude that (1) an integrated morphologic and biomarker algorithm may better optimize the early diagnosis of poorly differentiated sinonasal and skull-base tumors; (2) molecular analysis may assist in future biological stratification of certain classes of these tumors; and (3) the human achaete-scute homolog-1 gene transcript is a nonspecific marker for the diagnosis of neuroblastoma."

CD008054,0,10091310,0,[Diagnostic and therapeutic concepts of HPV infection in HIV-positive women].,"Among HIV-seropositive women there is a high prevalence of anogenital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV-DNA is more frequent detected in cervicovaginal-lavage specimens from HIV-seropositive women as in those from HIV-seronegative women. We and others suggest that HIV-infection increases the risk to have HPV-associated lesions of the lower female genital tract, especially the risk for developing a squamous intraepithelial lesion of the cervix. In this report we describe the current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in HIV-seropositive women with HPV-infection. The gynecological examination should be performed at six to twelve month intervals, including the colposcopy and the Pap smear test. We hope to improve the quality of our screening program by doing an additional HPV-test. At last we investigate the CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts because it is observed that women with low CD4+ cell counts (< 200/microliter) were more likely to have persistent HPV-infection as those with higher counts (> 500/microliter). The treatment method is dependent on the development of the HPV-associated lesion and the clinical status of the HIV infected women. In cases with external warts local application of Condylox should be the first line treatment. Probably in about few months we could use other drugs like Wartec or Aldara in Germany. But the effectiveness of these drugs in HIV-positive women has to be proven yet. In the cause of persistence of external warts or recurrence of the disease the systemical application of Intron A or Roferon A is possible. The CO2-lasertreatment is performed under colposcopic guidance, especially in cases with multicentric condylomatous lesions. The treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) by CO2-laservaporisation or Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) is based on the clear colposcopic visualisation of the upper limit of the lesion. If CIN reaches the endocervix, being out of colposcopic view, and the squamocolumnar junction is localised in the endocervical canal conisation by laser or cold knife has to be performed. Before performing the treatment of CIN one should exclude multicentric cervical, vaginal and vulval intraepithelial neoplasia by colposcopy, because multicentric intraepithelial neoplasia of the lower female genital tract is more frequently than in HIV-seronegative women. Multicentric disease seems to be one cause of the high recurrence of HIV-seropositive women. However, higher levels of immunosuppression (CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts < 200/microliter) are also important determinants of recurrence of the disease. Therefore, an accurate short-term follow-up with colposcopy, Pap test and HPV test should be carried out after the treatment of HIV-seropositive women with low CD4+ counts."
CD008054,0,10668198,0,Human papillomaviruses and DNA ploidy in anal condylomata acuminata.,"Previous studies have emphasized the usefulness of DNA ploidy measurement and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) detection as prognostic markers in low grade cervical lesions. We addressed the eventual relationship between HPV type, DNA profile, and p53 tumor suppressor protein expression in anal condylomata acuminata to eventually determine parameters which may be considered as predictive risk factors for the development of cancer. DNA ploidy was assessed by image cytometry after Feulgen staining of contiguous serial sections of 45 anal condylomata acuminata without atypia containing HPV detected by in situ hybridization and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). p53 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. DNA aneuploidy was found in 53.3% of these lesions, 48.9% containing non oncogenic HPV types 6 and/or 11 and 4.4% harbouring HPV types 11 and 18. The DNA diploid lesions were all associated with non oncogenic HPV types 6 and/or 11 and one case also contained HPV type 33. There was no significant correlation between the detection of DNA aneuploidy and the presence of immuno-detected p53. DNA aneuploidy was not related to the presence of oncogenic HPV in anal condylomata acuminata. The DNA aneuploid profile frequently observed, especially in lesions associated with non oncogenic HPV types, is not yet well explained and cannot be considered as a prognostic factor. In contrast, a more intensive clinical follow-up should be proposed in patients with oncogenic HPV associated to DNA aneuploidy."

CD008054,0,10764463,0,Testing for high-risk human papillomavirus types will become a standard of clinical care.,"Testing for high-risk human papillomavirus types should become a standard of care for women in the United States because cervical cancer is an infectious disease. Current care is based on cytologic screening and a pathologic staging of cellular tissue changes. Before these cellular modifications, there is a demonstrable pattern of human papillomavirus infection. Human papillomavirus is the most frequently acquired sexually transmitted disease in women and is usually eliminated without treatment. Persistence of high-risk human papillomavirus types can lead to abnormal cervical cellular changes. When these cervical cellular changes occur, physician interventions hasten human papillomavirus elimination. Currently, adding human papillomavirus screening to the Papanicolaou smear identifies a population for closer follow-up studies. In the future a vaccine should be introduced to prevent infections, and medical treatments to hasten the elimination of high-risk human papillomavirus types should become part of standard medical practice."

CD008054,0,19403762,0,RNA (E6 and E7) assays versus DNA (E6 and E7) assays for risk evaluation for women infected with human papillomavirus.,"In the majority of cases, high-risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV) infections regress spontaneously, with only a small percentage progressing to high-grade lesions. Current screening methods are based on DNA detection. An alternative would be to monitor expression of the E6 and E7 viral oncogenes continuously expressed by malignant phenotypes. In the work reported in this paper, we compared the two methods for a group of women with high-risk HPV infections. Cervical specimens from 400 women, previously found to be HPV DNA positive, were analyzed for HPV DNA by a liquid hybridization assay and typed by multiplex PCR (for types 16, 18, 31, and 33). Identification of HR HPV E6 and E7 RNA transcripts was performed using real-time reverse transcription-PCR and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assays. Results were compared with concurrent cytological data. HR HPVs were found in 61.2% of patients. The most common genotype was HPV type 16 (HPV-16) (47.1%), followed by HPV-18, HPV-31, and HPV-33. Nine percent of cases involved other genotypes. Among 223 HPV DNA-positive samples, only 118 were positive in the RNA test. Among HPV DNA-positive patients with normal cytology, we detected E6 and E7 RNA transcripts in two cases (18.2%). The rate of detection increased gradually with the grade of the observed lesions, rising from 20% for patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance to 48.1% for women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and 86.3% for those with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. These results suggest that testing for HPV E6 and E7 transcripts could be a useful tool for screening and patient management, providing more accurate predictions of risk than those obtained by DNA testing."
CD008054,0,12847617,0,Surgery versus pharmacotherapy of benign thyroid diseases.,"Surgical management of benign thyroid diseases (BTDs) has been a topic of interest and confusion for many years. Almost 80% of thyroidectomies at an average endocrine surgical unit are carried out for BTDs. Resistance to surgical intervention in BTDs has been based on the belief that increased complication rate is inherent in its use, this is despite the potential advantages in terms of confirming the benign nature of the lesion, controlling the disease, and relieving local symptoms of large neck mass. Benign thyroid diseases are more likely to occur in middle-aged women living in iodine deficient areas, or have a family history of goiter, or in patients taking iodine-containing drugs, like amoidarone, or in patients with previous history of x-ray exposure. However, the physician must be careful in making the diagnosis of BTDs in patients at the extremes of age or in the presence of positive history of radiation, or in patients with family history of thyroid or colon cancer. In this article we will review the etiology, epidemiology, diagnostic methodologies and the recent trends in the surgical and medical management of BTDs."

CD008054,0,8723825,0,Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma.,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva is a rare disease, mainly seen in elderly women. Risk factors are advanced age, an immunocompromised status, longstanding vulvar dystrophy, VIN, a history of vulvar human papillomavirus infection, and a history of cervical cancer. Vulvar cancer should be considered as a skin tumor and detection is possible in an early stage. However, because of patients' and doctors' delay, one in three vulvar cancers is not treated before an advanced stage. The tumor metastasizes mainly lymphatogenic. Spread starts in the inguinal lymph nodes. In the middle of this century, standard treatment, consisting of an en bloc dissection of the vulva and inguinal lymph nodes has been developed and applied. As a result, considerably improved survival rates were achieved: up to 90% 5-year survival rates for patients without lymph node metastases. However, complication rates were high. In recent years, a more individualized approach has replaced standard treatment. Surgical treatment now depends on the localization, size and extent of the tumor, and is followed or preceded by radiotherapy in selected cases. The role of chemotherapy in advanced disease is currently being studied in several referral centers. The most important success in the treatment of vulvar cancer in recent years is the maintenance of high survival rates despite considerably less extensive surgical treatment, resulting in lower complications rates. An important challenge for the near future will be the improvement of the management of advanced disease. However, an even more difficult issue may be the prevention of such large lesions. The reduction of treatment delays requires a considerable effort in education of both health care workers and the general public."

The well documented role of HPV and SIL in cervical carcinogenesis should lead to frequent, careful evaluation of HIV infected women. Forty-four cervical smears from 23 patients (20 HIV and 3 AIDS) were reviewed. While 11 of the 23 patients produced negative smears, 11 had abnormal cytological findings on at least one occasion. Sixteen smears (36 percent) from 10 patients (43%) showed evidence of HPV and/or SIL. Two smears (two patients) were assigned to the benign epithelial atypia category. (One of these showed keratosis which may indicate HPV infection.) Six smears (three patients) represented either a severe Trichomonas, fungal (Candida sp.), or Herpes infection. Three smears were deemed unsatisfactory for diagnosis due to severe acute inflammation or obscuring blood. Five biopsies were available. In four, histologic findings supported the original cytologic diagnosis. One patient with a negative smear had a biopsy showing condyloma.

One hundred of these 120 RS were available for review; and in each case, a reason for the discrepancy was established and classified as RS overcall, RS undercall, RS sampling error, or biopsy sampling error. Fifty-one discrepant RS were overcalled. They were reported initially as condyloma (19), mild dysplasia (22), and moderate dysplasia (10). One RS was undercalled. Nine RS were not diagnostic of the biopsy-proven lesion due to smear sampling error. The discrepancies in the remaining 39 cases were due to biopsy sampling error. Twenty-one of these 39 cases had additional biopsies or smears that confirmed the presence of condyloma/dysplasia, and 18 had negative follow-up. In summary, discrepancies were a result of pathologists' interpretative error, predominantly overcalls, in 52% of non-correlating cases, and smear or biopsy sampling error in the remaining 48%."
CD008054,0,17060897,0,"STD-prevention counseling practices and human papillomavirus opinions among clinicians with adolescent patients--United States, 2004.","In 2000, an estimated 18.9 million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) occurred in the United States. Although young persons aged 15-24 years represented only 25% of the sexually active population, approximately 48% of STD cases in 2000 occurred in this age group. The most common sexually transmitted infection in persons aged < or =24 years was attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV). Although the natural immunity of most young persons can clear HPV infections with no clinical consequences, certain infections persist and result in warts, precancerous changes, and invasive cancers of the anogenital region in both males and females. In 2000, an estimated 4.6 million new HPV infections occurred among persons aged 15-24 years, resulting in expected direct medical lifetime costs of 2.9 billion dollars. In June 2006, the Food and Drug Administration licensed the first HPV vaccine for females aged 9-26 years for the prevention of cervical cancer (U.S. 2000 incidence rate: 9.4 cases per 100,000), precancerous genital lesions, and genital warts associated with HPV types included in the vaccine (HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18). Protection has been demonstrated for genital infections associated with HPV types included in the vaccine; therapeutic efficacy for persons already infected has not been demonstrated. To assess 1) STD risk assessment, counseling, and education practices of U.S. health-care providers during routine adolescent check-ups and 2) provider opinions regarding methods to prevent HPV acquisition, CDC and Battelle Centers for Public Health Research and Evaluation surveyed clinicians who provided adolescent primary care. The results of this survey indicated that most of the clinicians assessed STD risk in their adolescent patients, addressed STD prevention, and recommended various STD-prevention methods; however, clinician opinions varied regarding the effectiveness of methods for preventing HPV infection and whether their patients would adopt these methods for the long term. Clinicians periodically should assess STD risk in their adolescent patients and provide STD counseling and education to reduce the incidence of STDs in this age group at high risk."

The clinicohistologic findings of surgical specimens from radical hysterectomy were compared with the results of HPV detection to use as a possible prognostic marker for the early detection of paraaortic nodes involvement. Metastasis to paraaortic nodes in cervical cancer, suggesting extrapelvic involvement of tumor, is clinically important to predict prognosis. The HPV-16 DNA was most prevalent in cervical cancers (76%; 34/45). Five tumors were positive for HPV-18, two tumors each were positive for HPV-31 or -33, one tumor was hybridized to HPV-45, and one woman had an unidentified type of HPV. No HPV was detected in three cases of cervical cancer. The histologic types of the cervical cancers were correlated with the HPV types. Of the 39 tissue specimens of squamous carcinomas analyzed, only 2 (5%) showed HPV-18, in contrast to 30 (77%) of 39 squamous carcinomas having HPV-16. Of the 5 cases of adenocarcinomas, 3 (50%) showed HPV-18, and 3 (50%) showed HPV-16. HPV DNAs were detected in histologically negative paraaortic lymph nodes (31%; 14/45): the HPV-positive PCR products from paraaortic nodes were only hybridized to HPV-16. The nature of the relationship between the presence of HPV DNA and node tumor involvement is still not known. HPV-16 DNA in paraaortic nodes may suggest subclinical early metastasis or tumor cells destroyed by immune cells and may provide important information in decisions regarding postoperative adjuvant treatment. The prognostic significance of HPV DNA in histologically negative paraaortic lymph nodes remains to be established after several years of follow-up."
CD008054,0,9180057,0,Design and methods of a population-based natural history study of cervical neoplasia in a rural province of Costa Rica: the Guanacaste Project.,"This paper reports on the enrollment phase of a population-based natural history study of cervical neoplasia in Guanacaste, a rural province of Costa Rica with consistently high rates of invasive cervical cancer. The main goals of the study are to investigate the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and its co-factors in the etiology of high-grade cervical neoplasia, and to evaluate new cervical cancer screening technologies. To begin, a random sample of censal segments was selected and enumeration of all resident women 18 years of age and over was conducted with the aid of outreach workers of the Costa Rican Ministry of Health. Of the 10738 women who were eligible to participate, 10049 (93.6%) were interviewed after giving written informed consent. After the interview on cervical cancer risk factors was administered, a pelvic examination was performed on those women who reported previous sexual activity. The pelvic examination included a vaginal pH determination and collection of cervical cells for cytologic diagnosis using three different techniques. Additional cervical cells were collected for determination of the presence and amount of DNA from 16 different types of HPV, and two photographic images of the cervix were taken and interpreted offsite by an expert colposcopist. Finally, blood samples were collected for immunologic and micronutrient assays. Women with any abnormal cytologic diagnosis or a positive Cervigram, as well as a sample of the whole group, were referred for colposcopy, and biopsies were taken when lesions were observed. The enrollment screening will serve as the basis for a prevalent case-control study, and the members of the cohort free from serious disease will be followed actively, at intervals of no more than a year, to study the natural history of HPV infection and the origins of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Details of the field operation are outlined, with particular reference to the realization of this kind of study in developing countries. Descriptive data on the prevalence of disease and exposure to various risk factors are also presented."
CD008054,0,18398022,0,Human papillomavirus in cervical cancer screening: important role as biomarker.,"Cervical cytology screening has reduced cervical cancer morbidity and mortality but shows important shortcomings in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Infection with distinct types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary etiologic factor in cervical carcinogenesis. This causal relationship has been exploited for the development of molecular technologies for viral detection to overcome limitations linked to cytologic cervical screening. HPV testing has been suggested for primary screening, triage of equivocal Pap smears or low-grade lesions and follow-up after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Determination of HPV genotype, viral load, integration status and RNA expression could further improve the effectiveness of HPV-based screening and triage strategies. The prospect of prophylactic HPV vaccination stresses the importance of modification of the current cytology-based screening approach."
CD008054,0,8009976,0,Intramuscular interferon-beta treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II associated with human papillomavirus infection.,"A placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of intramuscular injection of interferon-beta has been performed on 37 patients suffering from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II (CIN II) associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the cervix: twenty-two patients were treated with interferon-beta (2 x 10(6) I.U. daily) for ten days; fifteen received placebo (2 ml of saline solution daily) for ten days. Prior to therapy, and at day 70, 190, 370, 550, 730 after the beginning of treatment, patients were examined by colposcopy and punch biopsies of the cervix. Results showed a progressive amelioration in the interferon-beta treated patients, which was statistically significant at any control station (70, 190, 370, 550, 730 days) as compared to placebo treatment. Percentages of lesions that regressed, persisted or progressed were 36.4%, 54.5%, 9.1% respectively in the Interferon-beta group, and 0%, 67.7% and 33.3% respectively in the placebo group. Interferon-beta administered intramuscularly has shown to be an efficacious treatment of CIN II (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II) associated with HPV infection, without evident side effects; it can be used in patients requiring medical treatment with at least one-year monitoring by cervical biopsies or as an adjuvant surgical treatment (which remains the principal treatment) in the management of patients suffering from CIN II associated with HPV infection."
CD008054,0,21048794,0,Adenoviral delivery of Tousled kinase for the protection of salivary glands against ionizing radiation damage.,"Oral complications of salivary hypofunction often afflict cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. Dry mouth or xerostomia is an undesirable consequence of radiotherapy that compromises normal oral functions in addition to causing odynophagia and increasing the patient's risk of oral infections and dental caries. Radiation-induced xerostomia is irreversible, and palliative measures to provide symptomatic relief remain the mainstay of treatment. Previously, we identified a splice variant of a cellular kinase, Tousled-like kinase 1B (TLK1B), which when overexpressed protects normal epithelial cells against ionizing radiation (IR)-induced cell death. To address the need to protect salivary glands in patients undergoing regional radiotherapy, we investigated whether preemptive expression of TLK1B in salivary glands protects against IR. In stably-derived salivary cell lines in vitro, TLK1B expression increased cell survival after IR. Cells expressing exogenous TLK1B were less radiosensitive (A5-TLK1B, Î±/Î²=0.67âGy; ParC5-TLK1B, Î±/Î²=4.3âGy) compared to control cells (A5-BK, Î±/Î²=1.7âGy; ParC5-BK, Î±/Î²=32.7âGy). Using a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 viral vector for TLK1B gene transfer into rat submandibular salivary glands in vivo, we demonstrated that TLK1B protects the saliva-secreting acinar cells and better preserves salivary gland function against IR relative to control glands. After a single fraction of 16âGy, the decline in salivary function at 8 weeks was less pronounced in TLK1B-treated animals (40%) as compared to saline-treated controls (67%). Histopathological analysis demonstrated increase in acinar atrophy, decrease in acinar cell number, and increase in inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis in irradiated control tissues relative to TLK1B-treated glands. These results show the radioprotective benefits of TLK1B and implicate its usefulness in the management of regional radiotherapy-induced xerostomia."

CD008054,0,11236106,0,Continuing medical ignorance: modern myths in the management of genital warts.,"Genital warts are the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD) in industrialized countries. Since they also often respond poorly to current treatments, they account for substantial morbidity. Human papillomavirus (HPV) typing methods have shown that HPV 6 and 11, the most common types found in genital warts, are not found in cancer of the cervix. These types, however, do cause minor degrees of cervical dysplasia which also results in morbidity both through fear and through over-treatment. The sexual nature of transmission of genital warts has been known from ancient times; there is also good evidence of vertical transmission and transmission through non-genital contact. Barrier contractive methods do not completely prevent transmission of genital warts and may give little worthwhile protection. These facts, together with the established persistence of HPV contribute to the associated psychological morbidity. There are a number of treatments for genital (and other) warts. This attests to the fact that no one of these is clearly superior to the others. Until better treatments are developed much of the management of this condition must consist of using such treatments that are available to maximize efficacy while trying to reduce unnecessary costs, inconvenience and potential injury and sustaining morale through what may be a long and demoralizing course."
CD008054,0,9539974,0,Risk assessment in cervical dysplasia patients by single cell gel electrophoresis assay: a study of DNA damage and repair.,"Precancerous lesions of cervix, commonly known as dysplasia, present a complex problem because of their biological behavior. Increased genetic instability, either inherent or induced by some external mutagen, is considered as a primary event or a predisposing factor to neoplastic transformation. The relationship between genetic instability and susceptibility towards cervical cancer was evaluated with the comet or single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay. Among precancerous individuals, genomic instability was observed in cervical epithelial cells and peripheral blood leukocytes. The mean basal DNA damage and mean susceptibility to DNA damage by the mutagen (MNNG) treatment increased whereas repair capacity decreased with progression of the disease in a stepwise manner. Inter and intra individual variability was maximum in cancerous group. Risk was estimated by giving a predictive value for each precancerous individual. In combination with morphological, biochemical, and cytogenetic parameters, the SCGE assay may serve as a novel tool to predict the fate of cervical dysplasia."
CD008054,0,12060851,0,Allelic imbalance in hMLH1 or BRCA2 loci associated with response of cervical and endometrial cancer to radiotherapy.,"Effectiveness of radiotherapy is influenced by several genetic properties of the targeted cells. The aim of this study was the identification of prognostic indicators of tumor response to radiation in cervical and endometrial cancer. Using microsatellite DNA analysis, we investigated 31 markers, located on 1p, 2p, 2q, 3p, 9p, 9q, 13q, 17p and 17q for genomic alterations in 37 cervical and 21 endometrial cancer cases, with complete follow-up data. Genetic alterations of the initial tumor genotypes were observed after radiation in 86.5% of cervical and 81.0% of endometrial cases. Reversions to the original normal genotype were observed in 40.5 and 28.6% respectively, predominantly in cured patients rather than in recurred cases. Survival curves by the Kaplan-Meier method showed a worse prognosis for cervical cancer patients whose tumors harbor allelic imbalance (AI) on 3p or 13q, and for endometrial cancer patients whose tumors harbor AI on 13q. Our data suggest a possible association of the hMLH1 or BRCA2 genes, implicated in distinct DNA repair pathways and located on 3p and 13q respectively, with response of cervical and endometrial cancer to radiotherapy. Moreover, microsatellite DNA analysis before and after radiation treatment could be used as a marker of the clinical outcome of patients."

It is critical that patients with the ASCUS smear be properly evaluated and triaged, as the ASCUS smear may be a manifestation of high-grade disease in 20% or more of cases. Several options for triage exist. Colposcopy is considered by many the option of choice. However, alternative options include cervicography, speculoscopy, and human papillomavirus subtyping. For proper management of the patient with the ASCUS smear, the clinician must consider the patient's Pap test history, risk factors for cervical cancer, and the cytopathologist's interpretation/recommendation."

The aim of this study is to describe the incidence rates of these cancers between 1984 and 2001, and their relative survival probabilities, in Quebec (Canada) between 1984 and 1998. The incidence of these cancers is on the rise, particularly anal cancer in women and, more recently (since 1993-95), vulvar cancer. Between 1984-86 and 1993-95, the 5-year relative survival probability for men with anal cancer decreased from 57% to 46%, while that for penile cancer dropped from 75% to 59%. However, during the same period, the 5-year relative survival probability for women with anal cancer rose from 56% to 65%, and remained stable for cervical and vulvar cancers, at 74% and 82%, respectively."
CD008054,0,10566597,0,MICA gene polymorphism and the risk to develop cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is associated with human papillomaviruses (HPV) and the HLA genes. The MICA (MHC class I chain-related gene A) is expressed by keratinocytes and epithelial cells and interacts with gamma delta T cells. It is therefore possible that MICA might influence the pathogenesis of CIN and cervical cancer through presentation of viral or tumor antigens. To investigate this, we determined the MICA transmembrane allele frequencies in a prospective population-based cohort study from the VÃ¤sterbotten County in northern Sweden. 74 women developed CIN. 153 control women who remained healthy during follow up were matched for age. Five polymorphic microsatellite alleles of MICA were identified by a polymerase chain reaction-based (PCR) technique using fluorescent-labeled primers. MICA A5 and A5.1 were the most common alleles in this population. None of the alleles of MICA were associated with disease. The frequency of MICA allele A5 was higher among HPV 18 seropositive than HPV 18 seronegative patients but this difference was not significant after the correction of p value. In conclusion, microsatellite allele polymorphism of MICA transmembrane part is not associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia."
CD008054,0,11410486,0,Persistence of genetically altered fields in head and neck cancer patients: biological and clinical implications.,"In 1953, Slaughter et al. [D. P. Slaughter et al., Cancer (Phila.), 6: 963-968, 1953] proposed the concept of field cancerization in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) and discussed its clinical significance for the development of second primary tumors and local recurrences. To define the process of field cancerization and its putative clinical implications, we analyzed genetic aberrations in HNSCC and the accompanying macroscopically normal mucosa. In 28 HNSCC patients, loss of heterozygosity was determined in tumor and five noncontiguous mucosal biopsies using eight microsatellite markers at 9p, 3p, and 17p. For patients who showed loss of heterozygosity in their mucosal biopsies, all margins of the surgical specimen were subsequently analyzed to determine the extension of the field. In these cases, additional markers at 8p, 13q, and 18q as well as p53 mutations were included to determine subclonal differences between field and tumor. Genetically altered fields were detected in 36% (10 of 28) of the HNSCC patients. The field varied in size between patients and consisted of genetically different subclones. In 7 of 10 cases, the field extended into the surgical margins. One particular patient with a genetically altered field in a surgical margin developed a local recurrence after 28 months of follow-up. Microsatellite analysis showed that this recurrence had more molecular markers in common with the nonresected premalignant field than with the original tumor, suggesting that this persistent field has progressed further into a new malignancy. Our data show that genetically altered mucosa remains after treatment in a significant proportion of HNSCC patients, which may explain in part the high frequency of local recurrences and second primary tumors. Adequate identification and risk assessment of these genetically altered fields may have profound implications for future patient management."
CD008054,0,16472267,0,An apparently sporadic paraganglioma with an SDHB gene germline mutation presenting at age 68 years.,"Paragangliomas (PGLs) are rare tumours arising from parasympathetic-associated paraganglia (particularly of the head and neck) or from sympathetic-associated paraganglia such as in the adrenal medulla when they are termed phaeochromocytomas and at extra-adrenal sites in the abdomen and thorax. Recent reports have found frequent germline mutations of VHL, RET, SDHB or SDHD not only in familial cases but also in apparently sporadic cases of phaeochromocytoma. These germline mutations are particularly likely to be found if multifocal disease is present or if the phaeochromocytoma or PGL occurs at a young age. We report a germline splice site mutation in SDHB in a patient presenting with an incidental, apparently sporadic, abdominal sympathetic PGL at 68 years of age."
CD008054,0,17337390,0,[Invasive cervical cancer treatment costs in France].,"The objective of this study was to estimate the direct costs of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) management to the French national health insurance system the 1st year after ICC diagnosis. A retrospective survey was conducted in three centres in 2005, including 42 patients admitted for ICC between 2001-2003. Medical records were examined for data relating to treatments and to determine the management costs. To estimate the annual cost of ICC management in France, data were extrapolated to the general population. The number of new ICC cases in France was estimated at 3,247 in 2003. The mean hospitalisation cost increased with ICC severity at diagnosis: 9,164 euros for stage I, 15,999 euros for stage II, 22,697 euros for stage III, and 26,886 euros for stage IV. The annual cost associated with the medical management of ICC patients was estimated at 43,862,125 euros (sensitivity range 32,973,461 euros-54,748,422 euros) corresponding to a mean patient cost of 13,509 euros. Recent HPV vaccination studies have shown 100 % for a quadrivalent (6,11,16,18) HPV vaccine against HPV-induced carcinoma in situ (FIGO stage 0/CIN3), a precursor lesion that may develop into ICC. Thus, it is expected that this vaccine will significantly reduce the socio-economic burden associated with this disease."

We tested the biologic relevance of the Bethesda System (ie, its ability to establish a close correlation between biologic behavior and the different grades of lesions) in a series of 528 women with genital human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated precancerous lesions prospectively followed for 10 years. The cervical biopsies were reclassified as either low-grade or high-grade SIL, and the data obtained by colposcopy, Papanicolaou smear, and HPV typing, as well as the biological behavior of the lesions, were analyzed in these two groups. Altogether, 77.4% (376 of 486) of the lesions were classified as low-grade SIL lesions; the rest (22.6%) belonged to the high-grade SIL category. In the low-grade SIL category, 46.8% of the women were 24 years old or younger, as compared with 37.3% in the high-grade SIL group. The colposcopic appearance was normal significantly more frequently in the low-grade SIL lesions (22.1%) than in the high-grade category (8.5%) (P less than .001). A single Papanicolaou smear was inadequate to distinguish between low-grade and high-grade SIL, as evidenced by almost identical distributions of Papanicolaou smear class I and II cells in both categories. Noteworthy was the discovery of normal Papanicolaou smears in 8.2% of the high-grade SIL lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008054,0,10375935,0,[Iscador QuS and human recombinant interferon alpha (Intron A) in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)].,"For several years there has been the association between the persistent HPV infection (especially with high oncogenic potency i.e. 16, 18) and the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The pathomechanism is probably considered with spread of the early virus gene E1, E2 and the suppressor protein p53 complexes. Further on these complexes cause the neoplastic cell transformation. There has also been described the role of impaired immune response in these cases. The abnormalities cover malformation of antigen presenting system APC, decrease of MHC-I and MHC-II heavy chains rate, decrease of the Langer-hans cells and decrease of count and cytotoxic activities of lymphocytes B and NK cells. The invasive and destructive techniques of HPV associated CIN treatment do not respect its pathogenesis. Therefore the new non surgical methods of treatment would play a major role in treatment and prevention of women especially in their reproductive period. The aim of this work was the evaluation of the Iscador QuS and Intron A role in the management of HPV associated CIN. The 60 patients with CIN and HPV have been diagnosed and treated in our clinic for 12 months. Early results present increase of regression and significant decrease of progression rates in both groups of examined women, comparing to the control group. The stationery state rates in this groups of women were similar to the control group."
CD008054,0,11391816,0,Presence of proliferating (MiB-1-positive) cells in cervical smears of women infected with HIV is associated with clinical outcome: a study of Brazilian women.,"The hypothesis tested was that there is an association between the presence of proliferating (MiB-1-positive) cervical cells and clinical outcome of women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Female partners (attending the Gynecology Outpatients Clinic of the University Hospital of Rio Grande, Brazil) of known HIV-positive (HIV+) men were used for this pilot study. Among these women, 25 were also HIV+. Papanicolaou smears of these 25 HIV+ women and of 44 HIV- women were graded as negative, CIN I, CIN II, or CIN III, using neural network screening. MiB-1 grading and HPV identification were also performed. The immune status of patients was determined using the current Centers for Disease Control classification. In agreement with the scientific literature, in these Brazilian women both CIN and HPV were associated with HIV. In the HIV+ women, the immune status tends to correlate with MiB-1 grading. Also, in the one case in whom progression from CIN I to invasive cervical carcinoma was observed, the smear contained many MiB-1-positive cells. Staining cervical smears of HIV+ women is a simple procedure to get an indication of clinical outcome of the patient."

CD008054,0,10778971,0,Allelic loss and microsatellite alterations of chromosome 3p14.2 are more frequent in recurrent cervical dysplasias.,"Epidemiological studies have documented the unpredictable clinical progression or recurrence of cervical dysplasia. Recent studies have shown several molecular changes in cervical cancers and their associated dysplasia. We conducted molecular analyses on a retrospectively ascertained cohort of recurrent and nonrecurrent cervical dysplasia cases in an attempt to define molecular biomarkers to predict progressive or recurrent disease. Cases were chosen if long-term follow-up (3-5 years after conization) and biopsy confirmation were available. Paraffin-embedded, postconization cervical tissues from 19 recurrent and 18 nonrecurrent dysplasias were analyzed. Human papillomavirus (HPV) was identified by PCR for general and type-specific (HPV-16 and HPV-18) primers. Allelotyping analysis was performed by multiplex PCR using a panel of 16 microsatellite markers targeting putative tumor suppressor gene regions on chromosomes 3p, 5p, 6p, 9p, 11q, and 17p. The overall rate of HPV infection was similar in both groups. In the allelotyping analysis, loss of heterozygosity at the fragile histidine triad region in 3p14.2 was significantly higher in the recurrent group than in the nonrecurrent group (P = 0.005). Furthermore, microsatellite alterations (MAs) were more frequent in the recurrent group (mean MA index, 0.254) as compared with the nonrecurrent group (mean MA index, 0.085; P = 0.0025). These findings suggest that HPV status alone does not predict recurrence and that loss of heterozygos. ity at the fragile histidine triad region may represent a potential biomarker in predicting recurrence. Frequent MAs in the recurrent group may represent an underlying genomic instability that creates susceptibility for allelic loss, thus increasing the risk for recurrence or progression."
CD008054,0,18026629,0,Human papillomavirus and HPV vaccines: a review.,"Cervical cancer, the most common cancer affecting women in developing countries, is caused by persistent infection with ""high-risk"" genotypes of human papillomaviruses (HPV). The most common oncogenic HPV genotypes are 16 and 18, causing approximately 70% of all cervical cancers. Types 6 and 11 do not contribute to the incidence of high-grade dysplasias (precancerous lesions) or cervical cancer, but do cause laryngeal papillomas and most genital warts. HPV is highly transmissible, with peak incidence soon after the onset of sexual activity. A quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16 and 18) HPV vaccine has recently been licensed in several countries following the determination that it has an acceptable benefit/risk profile. In large phase III trials, the vaccine prevented 100% of moderate and severe precancerous cervical lesions associated with types 16 or 18 among women with no previous infection with these types. A bivalent (types 16 and 18) vaccine has also undergone extensive evaluation and been licensed in at least one country. Both vaccines are prepared from non-infectious, DNA-free virus-like particles produced by recombinant technology and combined with an adjuvant. With three doses administered, they induce high levels of serum antibodies in virtually all vaccinated individuals. In women who have no evidence of past or current infection with the HPV genotypes in the vaccine, both vaccines show > 90% protection against persistent HPV infection for up to 5 years after vaccination, which is the longest reported follow-up so far. Vaccinating at an age before females are exposed to HPV would have the greatest impact. Since HPV vaccines do not eliminate the risk of cervical cancer, cervical screening will still be required to minimize cancer incidence. Tiered pricing for HPV vaccines, innovative financing mechanisms and multidisciplinary partnerships will be essential in order for the vaccines to reach populations in greatest need."

CD008054,0,10873065,0,"Modulation of radiation response after epidermal growth factor receptor blockade in squamous cell carcinomas: inhibition of damage repair, cell cycle kinetics, and tumor angiogenesis.","We have recently demonstrated that molecular blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor with the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody C225 enhances the in vitro radiosensitivity of human squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) derived from the head and neck. In the present study, we further investigated the capacity of C225 to modulate the in vitro and in vivo radiation response of human SCC tumor cells and xenografts, and we examined several potential mechanisms that may contribute to the enhanced radiation response induced by C225. Tumor xenograft studies demonstrated complete regression of both newly established (20 mm3) and well-established (100 mm3) SCC tumors over a 55-100 day follow-up period in athymic mice treated with the combination of C225 (i.p. injection) and radiation. Cell cycle analysis via flow cytometry confirmed that combined treatment with C225 and radiation induced an accumulation of cells in the more radiosensitive cell cycle phases (G1, G2-M) with concurrent reduction in the proportion of cells in the more radioresistant S phase. Results from sublethal damage repair and potentially lethal damage repair analyses in cultured SCC cells demonstrated a strong inhibitory effect of C225 on postradiation damage repair. Further, exposure of SCC cells to C225 induced a redistribution of DNA-dependent protein kinase from the nucleus to the cytosol, suggesting one potential mechanism whereby C225 may influence the cellular response to radiation. Immunohistochemical analysis of SCC tumor xenografts after systemic administration of C225 demonstrated inhibition of the in vivo expression of tumor angiogenesis markers, including vascular endothelial growth factor and Factor VIII. Taken together, the collective data suggest that the profound in vivo antitumor activity identified in the xenograft setting when C225 is combined with radiation derives from more than simply the antiproliferative and cell cycle effects of EGFR system inhibition. In addition to antiproliferative growth inhibition, EGFR blockade with C225 appears to influence the capacity of human SCCs to effect DNA repair after exposure to radiation, and to express classic markers of tumor angiogenesis."

As infection by the human papillomavirus (HPV) is considered as the central risk factor for CxCa, current research focuses on the role of specific genetic and environmental factors in determining HPV persistence and subsequent progression of the disease. ASSIST is an EU-funded research project that aims to facilitate the design and execution of genetic association studies on CxCa in a systematic way by adopting inference and semantic technologies. Toward this goal, ASSIST provides the means for seamless integration and virtual unification of distributed and heterogeneous CxCa data repositories, and the underlying mechanisms to undertake the entire process of expressing and statistically evaluating medical hypotheses based on the collected data in order to generate medically important associations. The ultimate goal for ASSIST is to foster the biomedical research community by providing an open, integrated and collaborative framework to facilitate genetic association studies."
CD008054,0,9025830,0,Aspiration cytopathology of lymphoblastic lymphoma and leukemia: the MCV experience.,"Malignant lymphoma, lymphoblastic type (LL), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are two well-known pediatric malignancies whose diagnoses are typically established by surgical tissue biopsy and/or bone marrow examination. The status of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy in the diagnosis and management of these lymphoblastic malignancies is controversial. We present our experience from the past 7 years using FNA in children from 10 months to 15 years (mean age 10.5 years) of age with lymphoblastic cancers; in addition, two adult patients with ALL are included. Superficial FNA was performed in 16 cases (one patient had two aspirations 16 months apart). Eight patients were diagnosed with LL, six with ALL, and the one patient with two separate aspirates had lymphoblastic transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Five patients presented with the superior mediastinal syndrome. Sites of FNA included lymph node (nine cases), parotid gland (one), and soft tissues of the neck (four), buttock (one), and forehead (one). There were no complications from FNA. Except for one case (case 8), the patients with ALL and CML were previously diagnosed and treated for their disease, and FNA was performed primarily for the detection of disease recurrence. Conversely, in all eight children with LL, FNA was performed as the initial procedure to establish a primary diagnosis in previously well individuals. All eight LL patients responded-some dramatically-to chemotherapy. Two patients with LL and one with lymphoid blast crisis arising in CML had subsequent surgical biopsies that confirmed the FNA diagnosis. Immunophenotyping performed from 15 of 16 aspirates confirmed the T cell derivation of all cases of LL and 4 of 6 of ALL. Two of the ALL cases had a pre-B cell phenotype. Sufficient cells were obtained by FNA for flow cytometric DNA analysis in 9 of 16 cases. All cases but one were diploid, and 6 of 9 showed a high (> 6%) S phase. Our experience suggests that, when combined with immunologic phenotyping, definitive initial pathologic diagnosis of LL and recurrent ALL is possible and preferable using only aspiration cytopathology. It should be considered as part of the initial evaluation and management whenever a mass lesion appears in a child with a suspected lymphoblastic neoplasm. It can preclude the need for a surgically procured piece of tissue in those with a mediastinal mass and the superior mediastinal syndrome."

Papanicolaou smears (Paps) from 100 women (40-55 years old) with a cytologic interpretation of ASC of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing or a biopsy within 6 months were reviewed by 2 observers without knowledge of the biopsy diagnosis or HPV results. Cases in which both reviewers agreed that the Paps were diagnosed more properly as ""negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy"" were compared with cases of ""true ASCUS,"" using histologic squamous intraepithelial lesion and/or a positive high-risk HPV test as a positive outcome (abnormal follow-up). Of 100 cases, 28 were reclassified as benign by both observers. In 15 of these, the original ASCUS interpretation was based on cells with bland nuclear enlargement (2-3 times the area of intermediate cell nuclei), smooth nuclear membranes, and fine chromatin. Abnormal follow-up was identified in 1 (7%) of 15 benign cases but in 30 (42%) of 72 true ASCUS cases (P = .023). PM cells are a significant cause of ASC overdiagnosis in women 40 to 55 years old. Cervical Paps with cells no more atypical than these can be interpreted safely as negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy."

CD008054,0,8609644,0,Association between human papillomavirus type and clonal status of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions.,"Lesions that are histologically classified as precursors of cervical cancer, which are often referred to as squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs), represent a heterogeneous clinical entity that can be associated with many different types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and have a variable biologic behavior. Approximately one half of low-grade SILs behave as non-neoplastic, productive viral lesions that frequently regress spontaneously, whereas the other half behave as neoplasms and either persist or progress to a histologically higher grade lesion. Identification of biomarkers that reliably differentiate those low-grade SILs with the properties of a non-neoplastic viral infection from those with the properties of neoplasia would provide a more rational basis for decisions about disease management. Since monoclonality is a hallmark of neoplasia irrespective or organ site, clonal status might represent one such biomarker."

CD008054,0,15381905,0,p16(INK4A) expression is related to grade of cin and high-risk human papillomavirus but does not predict virus clearance after conization or disease outcome.,"The role of p16(INK4A) as a marker of HR-HPV and in the diagnosis of CIN has been well established, but its predictive value in the clearance of the virus after CIN treatment and its use as a prognostic marker of cervical cancer has not been studied. A series of 302 archival samples, including 150 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 152 CIN lesions, were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for p16(INK4A) and HPV testing using PCR with three primer sets (MY09/11, GP5/GP6, SPF). Follow-up data were available of 88 SCC patients, and 67 of the CIN lesions had been followed-up with serial PCR after conization. HR-HPV types were closely associated with CIN (OR 19.12; 95%CI 2.31-157.81) and SCC (OR 27.25; 95%CI 3.28-226.09). There was a significant linear relationship between the lesion grade and intensity of p16(INK4A) staining (p = 0.0001). The expression of p16(INK4A) was also closely related to HR-HPV (p = 0.0001). p16(INK4A) staining was a 100% specific indicator of CIN, with 100% PPV, and showed 83.5% sensitivity and 80.1% PPV in detecting HR-HPV. However, p16(INK4A) staining did not predict clearance/persistence of HR-HPV after treatment of CIN. Similarly, despite a slightly more favorable survival in women with strong/intense p16(INK4A) staining in univariate analysis, p16(INK4A) expression was not an independent prognostic predictor in multivariate survival (Cox) analysis. After adjustment for p16(INK4A) staining, HR-HPV, histological grade, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, and age, only the last two were significant prognostic predictors (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.003, respectively). The present data confirm the role of p16(INK4A) as a highly specific marker of CIN and HR-HPV type, but expression of this protein does not seem to be of any prognostic value in cervical cancer or in predicting the clearance of HR-HPV after treatment of CIN. We speculate that different subgroups of cervical cancer are characterized by aberrant p16(INK4A)/cyclin D/Rb pathways that are due to different mechanisms that can be mutually exclusive."
CD008054,0,18847560,0,Modeling cervical cancer prevention in developed countries.,"Cytology-based screening has reduced cervical cancer mortality in countries able to implement, sustain and financially support organized programs that achieve broad coverage. These ongoing secondary prevention efforts considerably complicate the question of whether vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 should be introduced. Policy questions focus primarily on the target ages of vaccination, appropriate ages for a temporary ""catch-up"" program, possible revisions in screening policies to optimize synergies with vaccination, including the increased used of HPV DNA testing, and the inclusion of boys in the vaccination program. Decision-analytic models are increasingly being developed to simulate disease burden and interventions in different settings in order to evaluate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of primary and secondary interventions for informed decision-making. This article is a focused review on existing mathematical models that have been used to evaluate HPV vaccination in the context of developed countries with existing screening programs. Despite variations in model assumptions and uncertainty in existing data, pre-adolescent vaccination of girls has been consistently found to be attractive in the context of current screening practices, provided there is complete and lifelong vaccine protection and widespread vaccination coverage. Questions related to catch-up vaccination programs, potential benefits of other non-cervical cancer outcomes and inclusion of boys are subject to far more uncertainty, and results from these analyses have reached conflicting conclusions. Most analyses find that some catch-up vaccination is warranted but becomes increasingly unattractive as the catch-up age is extended, and vaccination of boys is unlikely to be cost-effective if reasonable levels of coverage are achieved in girls or coverage among girls can be improved. The objective of this review is to highlight points of consensus and qualitative themes, to discuss the areas of divergent findings, and to provide insight into critical decisions related to cervical cancer prevention."

The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the diagnostic performance of the Hybrid Capture 2 test (HC2; Digene Corporation) in comparison with that of the recently developed PCR-based AMPLICOR HPV test (Roche Molecular Systems) for the detection of 13 hrHPV types. A reverse line blot hybridization assay (Innogenetics) was used as an internal reference standard in discordant cases. Two hundred seventy-one patients with atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASCUS) in cervical samples underwent hrHPV testing. The chi-square test was performed to compare respective proportions. Totals of 160/271 (59%) and 156/271 (58%) were found to be positive for hrHPV with HC2 and AMPLICOR, respectively. Concordant results were obtained for 235 (86.7%) of the 271 samples (kappa statistic, 0.73 +/- 0.04). Considering types 26, 53, and 66 as oncogenic types, negative predictive values (NPVs) of HC2 and AMPLICOR were 92.8% and 87.8%, respectively (difference was not significant), and their respective accuracies were 94.8% and 91.9% (difference was not significant). Considering types 26, 53, and 66 as not oncogenic, the respective HC2 and AMPLICOR NPVs were 92.8% and 97.4% (difference was not significant), and accuracy was significantly higher for the AMPLICOR assay (95.9% versus 90.8% for HC2) (P<0.05). For ASCUS samples, the NPV was 92.8% for HC2 testing and might be compromised if the copy number of HPV DNA was low. The NPV was 97.4% for the AMPLICOR assay and might be compromised if HPV types 26, 53, and 66 were considered oncogenic. The accuracy of these two assays is good and is compatible with routine clinical use in the triage of ASCUS cases."

This is a retrospective survey on the frequency of the cancer of the cervix observed from 1992 to 2002 about 23,908 withdrawals addressed to the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar for anatomopathological exam and 12,605 cervical smears for cytological exam. In pathological anatomy, 2,621 (63.4%) of 4,136 cases of diagnosed cancer, have been observed in women. 687 cases (26.2%) of them were localized in the collus. The 3/4 of the cancers of the cervix is invasive and the mean age is 48.2 years old at the time of diagnosis. The cytology detects only 74 cases of invasive cancer of which most don't have an histological confirmation. 274 pre-lesions of cervix cancer were diagnosed for this period, the majority lesions are cytological diagnosis.

CD008054,0,9528182,0,[Human papillomaviruses and carcinogenesis of the uterine cervix: future prospects in the domain of detection and prevention].,"It is now admitted that certain genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV), mainly HPV types 16 and 18, play an etiological role in the origin of the great majority of invasive carcinomas of the uterine cervix and their intraepithelial precursors. Such an evidence has modified our understanding of the natural history of cervical cancer and should result in new approaches for the early diagnosis and prevention of precursor lesions. Sensitive, specific and reliable HPV detection tests have been progressively designed but their use as routine tests requires multicentric studies, involving large series of women, to evaluate their usefulness in the clinical management or the screening of patients and to establish their limits and cost-effectiveness. It is already most likely that the association of HPV detection tests to cervicovaginal cytology would increase the detection rate of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and constitute a means for quality control in cytology. The viral origin of most cancers of the uterine cervix paves the way for their prevention by vaccination against the main oncogenic HPV genotypes and provides hope for specific immunotherapy of associated neoplasia."
CD008054,0,15055802,0,Identifying the combination of genetic factors that determine susceptibility to cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer is common among women all over the world. Although infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) has been identified as the primary cause of cervical cancer, only some of those infected go on to develop cervical cancer. Obviously, the progression from HPV infection to cancer involves other environmental and host factors. Recent population-based twin and family studies have demonstrated the importance of the hereditary component of cervical cancer, associated with genetic susceptibility. Consequently, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and microsatellites should be considered genetic factors for determining what combinations of genetic factors are involved in precancerous changes to cervical cancer. This study employs a Bayesian network and four different decision tree algorithms, and compares the performance of these learning algorithms. The results of this study raise the possibility of investigations that could identify combinations of genetic factors, such as SNPs and microsatellites, that influence the risk associated with common complex multifactorial diseases, such as cervical cancer."

Decreased CD4 lymphocytes, high human immunodeficiency viral load (HIVL) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are risk factors for CIN. We characterized the prevalence, risk factors and prognosis of histologically-verified CIN among systematically followed HIV-infected women enrolled from a low HIV-prevalence population. The study population comprised 153 HIV-infected women followed between 1989 and 2006. The mean +/- SD duration of follow-up was 5.6 +/- 3.8 years. Demographic as well as treatment-related data were derived from medical reports. During the follow-up, 51 subjects (33%) displayed CIN (16% CIN 1 and 18% CIN 2 +), whereas 102 subjects had Pap smear results of normal cells, atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance, or signs of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) but no CIN in histological specimens from the cervix. Only one case of cancer of the uterine cervix was detected. Pap smears were reliable in screening for CIN; 75% of patients with CIN had high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or LSIL in Pap smears taken at the time of dysplasia. The incidence of CIN decreased from 12.7 to 3.5 (per 100 subjects) between 2000 and 2005 (P = 0.07). The risk of CIN was not associated with decreased levels of CD4 lymphocytes, duration of HIV infection, use of antiretroviral medication or plasma HIVL. In univariate analysis, bacterial vaginosis (BV) was associated with a significantly increased risk of CIN, whereas parity was associated with lower risk of CIN. Each delivery lowered the risk of CIN by 30% (P = 0.02). The significantly lower risk of CIN among parous women (P = 0.04) persisted in multivariate analysis. CIN was treated by means of loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), (n = 34). The recurrence rate was low; seven subjects (14%) had a recurrence of CIN during follow-up. The nadir of CD4 lymphocytes was lower (P = 0.04) and the HIVL higher (P = 0.03) among subjects with recurrence of CIN. Duration of HIV infection, use of antiretroviral medication and positive margins in LEEP specimens were indistinguishable among subjects with vs. without recurrence of CIN. The prevalence of CIN is high among systematically managed HIV-infected women. However, the incidence of CIN decreased during the 21st century. BV was associated with an increased risk of CIN whereas parous women had lower risk of CIN. However, the patients with and without CIN could not be distinguished on the basis of previously described risk factors.

CD008054,0,18275641,0,Age at menarche is not an independent risk factor for high-risk human papillomavirus infections and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Data are controversial as to the role of menarche age as a risk factor of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infections. The objective of this study was to analyse the risk estimates for age at menarche as determinant of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and HR-HPV infections. A cohort of 3187 women were stratified into three groups according to their age at menarche: (i) women <13 years of age; (ii) those between 13 and 14 years and (iii) women >15 years of age. These groups were analysed for predictors of (a) HR-HPV, (b) high-grade CIN and (c) outcome of HR-HPV and cytological abnormalities during prospective follow-up. All the three groups had identical prevalence of HR-HPV, Papanicolaou smear abnormalities and CIN grades. In contrast to menarche age itself, the time from menarche to the first intercourse (TMI), to the first pregnancy (TMP) and to the first delivery (TMD) were all significant (P = 0.0001) predictors of HR-HPV (but not CIN2) in univariate analysis, but lost their significance in a multivariate model. Outcome of cervical disease and HR-HPV infection was unrelated to menarche age, the latter and the three intervals being not predictors of CIN2 in a multivariate model. In conclusion, age at menarche and the intervals between menarche and (i) onset of sexual activity, (ii) first pregnancy and iii) first delivery, are not independent predictors of HR-HPV infections and CIN2 in multivariate analysis."

To explore novel therapeutic strategies in the management of this disease, the potential of Ad5CMV-p53-mediated gene transfer to NPC cells was investigated in vitro. Two NPC cell lines, CNE-1 and CNE-2Z, were infected with either Ad5CMV-p53 or Ad5CMV-beta-galactosidase and evaluated for transduction efficiency and cytotoxicity. At a multiplicity of infection of 50 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell, Ad5CMV-beta-galactosidase infection and beta-galactosidase expression were detected in almost 100% of treated NPC cells. High levels of recombinant p53 protein expression were also observed in the NPC cell lines when treated with Ad5CMV-p53 at 50 pfu/cell. Expression of recombinant p53 was dose and time dependent, with peak levels observed at 24 h. A marked increase in WAF1/CIP1 expression was also observed in NPC cells after Ad5CMV-p53 infection. Expression of bcl-2 and bax were minimally detectable at baseline; infection with Ad5CMV-p53 induced no changes in the protein levels in the NPC cells. Growth of NPC cells treated with Ad5CMV-p53 was observed to be significantly inhibited when determined by either the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide or clonogenic assay. Infection with Ad5CMV-p53 at 25 pfu/cell resulted in survival levels of 0.35 and 11% in CNE-1 and CNE-2Z cells, respectively. Chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation were also observed, demonstrating that these cells were undergoing apoptosis. However, when GM38 (normal human fibroblasts) were subjected to identical treatments, they demonstrated significantly lower infection efficiency and transgene expression and were resistant to Ad5CMV-p53-mediated cytotoxicity.

CD008054,0,12643008,0,A phase II study of 13-cis retinoic acid plus interferon alpha-2a in advanced stage penile carcinoma: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study (E3893).,"Combined biological therapy with 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cRA) and interferon alpha-2a (IFN alpha-2a) was reported to be highly effective in squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and skin. Squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is rare in the United States, accounting for less than 1/2% of all male malignancies. Because of the association of infection with human papillomavirus with both carcinomas of the cervix and penis and their shared squamous cell histology, we carried out a phase II study of 13-cRA and IFN alpha-2a in carcinoma of the penis."
CD008054,0,16999634,0,"A content analysis of news coverage of the HPV vaccine by U.S. newspapers, January 2002-June 2005.","Genital Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. Of the 100 HPV types, HPV type 16 and HPV type 18 have been demonstrated to cause cervical cancer. Two pharmaceutical manufacturers have developed and tested HPV vaccines and are applying to the FDA for licensure. This research describes the content of HPV vaccine information contained in news articles. The Lexis-Nexis database was used to identify 25 articles on HPV that were published in 285 U.S. newspapers from January 1, 2003 to June 17, 2005. The coding schema captured information about the news event and source, as well as HPV and cervical cancer, transmission, vaccine, potential impact of the vaccine, and its relationship to PAP tests. The content analysis revealed that the news coverage of HPV vaccine provides information on the experimental status and efficacy of the vaccine, explains link between HPV and cervical cancer, and reports the manufacturers by name, as well as relies on them for a news source. Detailed information about HPV, however, was frequently missing which could lead to an incomplete picture or lack of understanding of the complexity of HPV and cervical cancer. As a major source of medical information, the media can be particularly important in educating policy makers and the general public about new scientific advances. Public health officials may wish to collaborate with journalists, health educators, healthcare providers, and women's health advocates to ensure that future educational initiatives explain the complexity of the association of HPV and cervical cancer and to stress the importance of continued cervical cancer screening."
CD008054,0,21190187,0,Combined CADM1 and MAL promoter methylation analysis to detect (pre-)malignant cervical lesions in high-risk HPV-positive women.,"Given the lower specificity for high-grade cervical lesions of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing compared to cytology, additional triage testing for hrHPV test-positive women is needed to detect high-grade cervical lesions. Here, we tested whether combined methylation analysis for cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) and T-lymphocyte maturation associated protein (MAL), both functionally involved in cervical carcinogenesis, could serve as such a triage marker. Four quantitative methylation-specific PCRs (qMSP), two for CADM1 (regions M12 and M18) and MAL (regions M1 and M2) each, were applied to 261 cervical tissue specimens ranging from no neoplasia to carcinoma. When qMSPs were combined and positivity for at least one of the qMSPs in the combination was taken into account, the highest positivity rates for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) lesions (97%) and squamous cell- and adeno-carcinomas (99%) were obtained by combining a single CADM1 marker with a single MAL marker. Subsequent qMSP analysis of 70 GP5+/6+-PCR hrHPV-positive scrapings revealed that a two-marker panel consisting of CADM1-M18 and MAL-M1 was most discriminative, detecting 90% of women with CIN3 (n = 30), whereas it showed a positive result in only 13.5% of women without cervical disease (n = 40). Finally, we applied hrHPV GP5+/6+-PCR testing followed by CADM1-M18/MAL-M1 methylation analysis to a cohort of 79 women visiting the outpatient colposcopy clinic. hrHPV testing revealed a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 33% for CIN3+. Additional CADM1-M18/MAL-M1 methylation analysis on the hrHPV-positive women increased the specificity to 78% with a sensitivity of 70%. In conclusion, the methylation marker panel CADM1-M18 and MAL-M1 may serve as an alternative molecular triage tool for hrHPV-positive women."
CD008054,0,7728779,0,"Serum antibody responses against human papillomavirus in relation to tumor characteristics, response to treatment, and survival in carcinoma of the uterine cervix.","To investigate whether the serum antibody responses to human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical carcinoma were related to the clinical and histopathological features of the tumors and how the antibody responses were affected by treatment, pretreatment serum samples from 66 patients with carcinoma of the cervix were studied for the presence of IgA or IgG responses against six defined HPV epitopes. Posttreatment serum samples were drawn from the same patients 2-24 months after initiation of treatment. There was no significant correlation between pretreatment level of any of the investigated antibodies and clinical stage or differentiation of tumor. For the IgA responses to the epitopes 245:16 and 245:18 in the E2 protein there was a significant correlation between an increased pretreatment antibody level and a shortened survival. A high pretreatment value of IgA against 245:16 was also associated with the absence of any complete response after therapy. The antibody levels declined dramatically after therapy for most of the antigens studied. However, this decline was seen both among the 53 patients with complete remission and among the 13 patients with remaining or progressive disease. Thus, the investigated serological responses were not useful as tumor markers, since patients with progressive, late-stage disease may fail to mount an antibody response to these proteins. However, pretreatment levels of the serological responses to the HPV epitopes 245:16 and 245:18 were associated with prognosis in cervical cancer."
CD008054,0,10563567,0,Audit of cervical screening and colposcopy in HIV-positive women at a central London teaching hospital.,"The purpose of this audit was to assess the prevalence of cervical pathology and clinical outcome in HIV-infected women as well as adherence to local screening guidelines. As there are no national screening guidelines for HIV-positive patients, recommendations vary widely. At St Stephen's Centre, these included annual cytology and a baseline colposcopy. We audited this recommendation by a clinical notes review using a computer database. Analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Two hundred and twenty-two patients were eligible for analysis, their mean age was 33.6 years, median CD4 count was 239 and median viral load was 7836 RNA copies. Cytology was undocumented in 72 women (32.4%), while overall 42 (28%) smears of the remaining 150 patients were abnormal: borderline 17.3%, mild dyskaryosis 4.6%, moderate dyskaryosis 4%, severe dyskaryosis 2%. The results were normal in 64% and unsatisfactory in 4.6%. Colposcopy was offered to 93 (42%) women who attended at least once in 71 cases (32%). Thirty-one women had biopsies taken (43.6% of all colposcopies). Twenty-four (77.4%) had a histology more severe than HPV and 15 (48.4%) more severe than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-1. Overall, 49.7% had management not complying with the guidelines. This audit led to a critical literature review and of local screening guidelines. A computer aided reminder program has now been installed and re-auditing of the management of HIV-positive women is planned."
CD008054,0,12085257,0,Human papillomavirus infection as a risk factor for anal and perianal skin cancer in a prospective study.,"Human papillomavirus has emerged as the leading infectious cause of cervical and other anogenital cancers. We have studied the relation between human papillomavirus infection and the subsequent risk of anal and perianal skin cancer. A case-cohort study within two large Nordic serum banks to which about 760 000 individuals had donated serum samples was performed. Subjects who developed anal and perianal skin cancer during follow up (median time of 10 years) were identified by registry linkage with the nationwide cancer registries in Finland and Norway. Twenty-eight cases and 1500 controls were analysed for the presence of IgG antibodies to HPV 16, 18, 33 or 73, and odds ratios of developing anal and perianal skin cancer were calculated. There was an increased risk of developing anal and perianal skin cancer among subjects seropositive for HPV 16 (OR=3.0; 95%CI=1.1-8.2) and HPV 18 (OR=4.4; 95%CI=1.1-17). The highest risks were seen for HPV 16 seropositive patients above the age of 45 years at serum sampling and for patients with a lag time of less than 10 years. This study provides prospective epidemiological evidence of an association between infection with HPV 16 and 18 and anal and perianal skin cancer."
CD008054,0,15361181,0,Prophylactic human papillomavirus vaccines: the beginning of the end of cervical cancer.,"Persistent infection with one of the oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types is a necessity for the development of cervical cancer. By HPV vaccination, cervical cancer could become a very rare disease. Two types of HPV vaccines can be distinguished: (i) therapeutic vaccines which induce cellular immunity targeted against epithelial cells infected with HPV and (ii) prophylactic vaccines inducing virus-neutralizing antibodies protecting against new but not against established infections. At present, several vaccines have been developed and tested in clinical trials. The vaccines are generally well tolerated and highly immunogenic. The current clinical data indicate that prophylactic vaccines are very effective against new persistent infections and the development of cervical intraepithelial lesions. The protection is type specific. However, the follow-up of the vaccination trials is still short. The effect of HPV vaccines on future cancer incidence will only be known after decades of follow-up. This article will address the status of recently terminated phase II and currently running phase III trials with prophylactic HPV vaccines."
CD008054,0,16736006,0,Detection of adeno-associated virus type 2 genome in cervical carcinoma.,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) can impair the replication of other viruses. Adeno-associated virus seroprevalences have been reported to be lower among women with cervical cancer. In-vitro, AAV can interfere with the production of human papillomavirus virions. Adeno-associated virus-2 DNA has also been detected in cervical cancer tissue, although not consistently. To evaluate the role of AAV infection in relation to invasive cervical cancer, we performed a nested case-control study within a retrospectively followed population-based cohort. A total of 104 women who developed invasive cervical cancer on average 5.6 years of follow-up (range: 0.5 months-26.2 years) and 104 matched control-women who did not develop cervical cancer during the same follow-up time were tested for AAV and human papillomavirus by polymerase chain reaction. At baseline, two (2%) case-women and three (3%) control-women were positive for AAV-2 DNA. At the time of cancer diagnosis, 12 (12%) case-women and 3 (3%) matched control-women were positive for AAV-2 DNA. Persisting AAV infection was not evident. In conclusion, AAV-2 DNA was present in a low proportion of cervical cancers and we found no evidence that the presence of AAV in cervical smears of healthy women would be associated with reduced risk of cervical cancer."
CD008054,0,12223432,0,"Vitamin A, carotenoids, and risk of persistent oncogenic human papillomavirus infection.","Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the main etiologic factor for cervical neoplasia, although infection alone is insufficient to produce disease. Cofactors such as nutritional factors may be necessary for viral progression to neoplasia. Results from previous studies have suggested that higher dietary consumption and circulating levels of certain micronutrients may be protective against cervical neoplasia. This study evaluated the role of vitamin A and carotenoids on HPV persistence comparing women with intermittent and persistent infections. As determined by the Hybrid Capture II system, oncogenic HPV infections were assessed at baseline and at approximately 3 and 9 months postbaseline. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk of persistent HPV infection associated with each tertile of dietary and circulating micronutrients. Higher levels of vegetable consumption were associated with a 54% decrease risk of HPV persistence (adjusted odds ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.97). Also, a 56% reduction in HPV persistence risk was observed in women with the highest plasma cis-lycopene concentrations compared with women with the lowest plasma cis-lycopene concentrations (adjusted odds ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-1.01). These data suggest that vegetable consumption and circulating cis-lycopene may be protective against HPV persistence."

At baseline, nine (0.3%) women had prevalent lesions > or = CIN3, all being hrHPV positive. After 5 years of follow-up, four (6.5%) of the 62 hrHPV-positive women with normal cytology developed lesions > or = CIN3, vs only one (0.05%) of the 2175 hrHPV-negative women with normal cytology. High-risk human papillomavirus testing or combined screening revealed a much higher sensitivity, at the cost of a small decrease in specificity, and a higher negative predictive value for the detection of lesions > or = CIN3 till the next screening round (5 years) than cytology alone."
CD008054,0,17609075,0,Human papillomavirus testing with conventional Pap smear screening in three inner London community clinics.,This observational study aimed to establish prevalence of high-risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPV) in women attending three inner London community clinics for routine screening and to pilot hrHPV testing in the triage of either borderline or negative cytology after previous abnormalities. Hybrid Capture 2 was carried out on brush samples taken alongside conventional smears from 1434 women aged 20-49 years. hrHPV positivity prompted earlier referral of women with previous abnormalities and either low-grade or negative cytology. Outcome at colposcopy was compared with the records of 1871 women aged 20-49 years attending colposcopy during the same period of time (routine colposcopies).
CD008054,0,15857016,0,The impact of anti HPV vaccination on cervical cancer incidence and HPV induced cervical lesions: consequences for clinical management.,"Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. Screening for cervical cancer is accomplished utilizing a Pap smear and pelvic exam. While this technology is widely available and has reduced cervical cancer incidence in industrialized nations, it is not readily available in third world countries in which cervical cancer incidence and mortality is high. Development of cervical cancer is associated with infection with high risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) creating a unique opportunity to prevent or treat cervical cancer through anti-viral vaccination strategies. Several strategies have been examined in clinical trials for both the prevention of HPV infection and the treatment of pre-existing HPV-related disease. Clinical trials utilizing prophylactic vaccines containing virus-like particles (VLPs) indicate good vaccine efficacy and it is predicted that a prophylactic vaccine may be available within the next five years. But, preclinical research in this area continues in order to deal with issues such as cost of vaccination in underserved third world populations. A majority of clinical trials using therapeutic agents which aim to prevent the progression of pre-existing HPV associated lesions or cancers have shown limited efficacy in eradicating established tumors in humans possibly due to examining patients with more advanced-stage cancer who tend to have decreased immune function. Future trends in clinical trials with therapeutic agents will examine patients with early stage cancers or pre-invasive lesions in order to prevent invasive cervical cancer. Meanwhile, preclinical studies in this field continue and include the further exploration of peptide or protein vaccination, and the delivery of HPV antigens in DNA-based vaccines or in viral vectors. Given that cervical cancers are caused by the human papillomavirus, the prospect of therapeutic vaccination to treat existing lesions and prophylactic vaccination to prevent persistent infection with the virus are high and may be implemented in the near future. The consequences for clinical management may include a significant reduction in the frequency of Pap smear screening in the case of prophylactic vaccines, and the availability of less invasive and disfiguring treatment options for women with pre-existing HPV associated lesions in the case of therapeutic vaccines. Implementation of both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine regimens could result in a significant reduction of health care costs and reduction of worldwide cervical cancer incidence."
CD008054,0,12464379,0,Human papillomavirus testing for triage of women referred because of abnormal smears. a decision analysis considering outcomes and costs.,"The objective of this article was to evaluate the utility of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing for triage of women referred for colposcopy because of abnormal smears. We considered women with persistent mild or moderate dyskaryosis and women with severe dyskaryosis who were referred for colposcopy. For both patient groups we evaluated three alternative management policies: (1) conventional management based on histological assessment; (2) HR-HPV-triage with direct treatment without prior histologic assessment for HR-HPV-positive women and conventional management for HR-HPV-negative women; and (3) direct treatment without histologic assessment for all referred women. For each policy the average number of medical procedures, doctor visits, and the costs per referred woman were calculated. Based on a literature review, the results were tested and translated to other patient groups. Per woman with persistent mild or moderate dyskaryosis and compared with conventional policy, HR-HPV-triage will avoid 0.51 colposcopically directed biopsies, but adds 0.05 local treatments of the cervix (i.e., loop excision of the transformation zone) and 0.09 outpatient visits, and will cost $134 US dollars extra. HPV triage is less efficient in women with borderline or mildly dyskaryotic cytology. In women with severe dyskaryosis, direct treatment is more efficient as conventional management or HPV triage. The decision to introduce HPV testing or direct treatment in women with persistent mild or moderate dyskaryosis strongly depends on the relative burden attributed to a colposcopically directed biopsy and an outpatient visit compared to loop excision of the transformation zone treatment of the cervix. For women with severe dyskaryosis, direct treatment should be seriously considered."
CD008054,0,7980308,0,Recent negative cytology prior to histologically confirmed carcinoma in situ of the cervix.,"Women with histologically confirmed carcinoma in situ of the cervix were studied within the records of the Victorian Cervical Cytology Registry. The prevalence of histologically confirmed carcinoma in situ during 1992 was 2.67 per 1,000 women screened. Thirty per cent (401 of 1,327) of the women with carcinoma in situ had negative cervical cytology reported during the 2 years prior to the diagnosis of carcinoma in situ and at least 49% (648 of 1,327) had negative cytology during the preceding 5 years. Adenocarcinoma in situ comprised 3.4% of all cases; these women were significantly older and more likely to have had a recent negative smear report than women with squamous carcinoma in situ. Fifty-five per cent of the women with squamous carcinoma in situ had HPV reported on the biopsy compared with only 27% of the women with adenocarcinoma in situ. Ten per cent of the women with carcinoma in situ had a past history of cytological or histological abnormality; this proportion did not vary by type of carcinoma in situ. This relatively high proportion of negative cytology in close proximity to a diagnosis of carcinoma in situ is to be expected if there is active treatment of lesser lesions and frequent screening of members of the community."
CD008054,0,20367631,0,Local applications of GM-CSF induce the recruitment of immune cells in cervical low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.,Quantitative alterations of antigen-presenting cells (APC) in (pre)neoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection suggest a diminished capacity to capture viral antigens and to induce a protective immune response.
CD008054,0,9754647,0,HPV 16 infection and progression of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia: analysis of HLA polymorphism and HPV 16 E6 sequence variants.,"High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection plays an important role in cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN), but HPV infection alone is not sufficient for progression to cervical cancer. Several lines of evidence suggest that cellular immune surveillance is important in the control of HPV infection and the development of CIN. The presentation to T cells of target viral peptides in the context of HLA molecules is influenced by the genetic polymorphisms of both HPV and HLA and thereby influences the host immune response and clinical outcome of HPV infection. HLA class I and II polymorphism in susceptibility for HPV 16 infection, development and progression of CIN was analyzed in a group of 118 patients participating in a prospective study of women with initial abnormal cytology. Patients were stratified according to HPV status and course of the disease. HLA-B*44 frequency was increased in the small group of patients with a lesion that showed clinical progression during follow-up [OR = 9.0 (4.6-17.5), p = 0.007]. HLA-DRB1*07 frequency was increased among HPV 16-positive patients compared with patients who were negative for all HPV types [OR = 5.9 (3.0-11.3), p = 0.02]. Our results are consistent with the immunogenetic factors associated with disease progression being different from those associated with susceptibility to HPV 16 infection. Sequencing of the HPV 16 E6 and E7 open reading frames of a subset of these patients (n = 40) showed the frequency of HPV 16 variants to be similar to other studies. However, there was no significant correlation between variant incidence and disease progression or viral persistence and no significant correlation with any HLA allele. It appears that multiple HLA types can influence HPV 16-associated cervical dysplasia but the role of HPV 16 variants in disease progression and susceptibility in relation to HLA polymorphism remains unclear."
CD008054,0,11072216,0,Cervical cancer screening in Sweden.,"Organised cervical cancer screening was implemented in Sweden in the mid-1960s. A marked decline in cervical cancer incidence could be attributed to the time-point of start of screening. Squamous cell carcinoma has declined by 60%, whereas adenocarcinoma has increased. About 950000 papanicolaou (Pap) smears are taken annually. Only 31% of the smears taken in the organised screening programme. As of 1998, the screening guidelines are 3-yearly tests between 23 and 50 years of age and 5-yearly tests between 50 and 60 years of age. The article reviews the screening practise in Sweden, the current efforts to improve the quality of the screening programme, as well as the ongoing randomised evaluations of organised primary screening for cervical human papilloma virus (HPV) infection."

CD008054,0,19410212,0,Caring for women with abnormal papanicolaou tests during pregnancy.,"The Papanicolaou (Pap) test is one of the best screening tests available for cancer detection and has achieved widespread acceptance among women. Pregnancy provides a valuable opportunity to educate and screen women for cervical cancer when receiving prenatal care. However, evolving knowledge about the course of human papillomavirus infection (HPV) in women, new technologies, and the advent of vaccines are driving radical changes in practice and new ways to consider cervical cancer screening. Modifications in the 2006 Consensus Guidelines for the Management of Women with Abnormal Cervical Cancer Screening Tests are most evident among adolescents. Because of high rates of HPV regression, pregnant adolescents with minor Pap abnormalities may now be followed rather than referred for immediate colposcopy. Postponing colposcopy in pregnant, reproductive-age women with minor Pap changes until after delivery is now acceptable. Pregnant immunocompromised women with abnormal Pap tests are followed similarly to pregnant women in the general population. While a strong evidence base is gradually emerging to support guideline revisions, the highest quality evidence may not yet be available for all recommendations. Midwives can keep abreast of the science while using clinical judgment to provide safe and expert cancer screening care to women."

CD008054,0,10752657,0,Gynaecological infections as risk determinants of subsequent cervical neoplasia.,"A longitudinal cohort study was carried out to determine whether gynaecological infections other than human papillomavirus (HPV) are also related to the subsequent increased risk of cervical neoplasia. The study comprised 19114 women attending the organized mass screening in Finland in 1985-1990 with cytologically detected HPV, Actinomyces, herpes simplex, Trichomonas vaginalis, or yeast. The women were followed-up for subsequent preinvasive lesions and invasive cancers until the end of 1994 by linkage to the nation-wide Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) with rates for the whole of Finland as reference and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Trichomonas vaginalis and HPV were associated with a high relative risk of cervical cancer, SIR 6.4 (CI 3.7-10, preinvasive lesion and invasive cancer combined) and SIR 5.5 (CI 4.2 7.2, preinvasive lesion and invasive cancer combined), respectively. Herpes simplex was rarely detected, but the highest and statistically most significant point estimate was observed (SIR 12, CI 2.4-34, preinvasive lesion and invasive cancer combined). Neither Actinomyces nor yeast was associated with a significantly increased risk of cervical cancer. None of these results could be accounted for by the confounding effect of the other infections. Our results, based on a prospective design, lead us to propose that Trichomonas vaginalis and herpes simplex virus are also predictors for cervical neoplasia."
CD008054,0,18257611,0,"Human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 vaccine (recombinant, AS04 adjuvanted, adsorbed) [Cervarix].","Cervarix is a prophylactic vaccine comprised of a mixture of virus-like particles derived from the L1 capsid proteins of human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 formulated with the AS04 adjuvant system. It is administered by intramuscular injection as a three-dose vaccine regimen at 0, 1 and 6 months. The vaccine is indicated for the prevention of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2 and CIN 3) and cervical cancer causally related to HPV types 16 and 18. In randomized, double-blind, phase II or III trials in >19,000 women aged 15-25 years, the HPV 16/18 vaccine showed high efficacy in preventing CIN 2+ associated with HPV 16/18. Cross-protection against new incident or 6-month persistent HPV 45 or HPV 31 infection was also evident. Phase II follow-up was for at least 5.5 years, and the phase III interim analysis was at approximately 15 months after the first vaccine dose. In a bridging study, in adolescent girls aged 10-14 years, the HPV 16/18 vaccine induced twice the already high antibody titres as it did in young women (aged 15-25 years). The immune response in older women (aged 26-55 years) at 24 months in another study was >or= 8-fold higher than antibody levels reported in younger age groups. Anti-HPV 16/18 antibody responses were greater with an AS04-adjuvanted HPV 16/18 vaccine than with an aluminium salt-adjuvanted formulation. The HPV 16/18 vaccine was generally well tolerated and injection-site reactions were the most common vaccine-related adverse events reported."
CD008054,0,20445775,0,Correlation of DNA ploidy with progression of cervical cancer.,"The majority of squamous cell carcinomas of cervix are preceded by visible changes in the cervix, most often detected by cervical smear. As cervical cancer is preceded by long precancerous stages, identification of the high-risk population through detection of DNA ploidy may be of importance in effective management of this disease. Here we attempted to correlate aneuploid DNA patterns and their influence on biological behavior of flow-cytometry analysis of DNA ploidy which was carried out in cytologically diagnosed cases of mild (79), moderate (36), and severe (12) dysplasia, as well as ""atypical squamous cells of unknown significance (ASCUS)"" (57) along with controls (69), in order to understand its importance in malignant progression of disease. Cytologically diagnosed dysplasias, which were employed for DNA ploidy studies, 39 mild, 28 moderate, and 11 severe dysplasia cases were found to be aneuploid. Out of the 69 control subjects, 6 cases showed aneuploidy pattern and the rest 63 subjects were diploid. An aneuploidy pattern was observed in 8 out of 57 cases of cytologically evaluated ASCUS. The results of the followup studies showed that aberrant DNA content reliably predicts the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in cervical smear. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA ploidy may provide a strategic diagnostic tool for early detection of carcinoma cervix. Therefore, it is a concept of an HPV screening with reflex cytology in combination with DNA flow cytometry to detect progressive lesions with the greatest possible sensitivity and specificity."

HPV-16/18 DNAs were detected by polymerase chain reaction using HPV E6 type-specific primers in 79 patients with cervical cancer. 31 patients who had pelvic lymph node metastasis (group I) and 48 patients without pelvic lymph node metastasis (group II) who were proven by pathologic examination of surgical specimens. HPV-16 or -18 DNAs were detectable in cervical carcinoma tissues in 60 patients from 79 cervical cancer patients (75.9%; HPV-16 was 67.1% and HPV-18 was 8.9%). HPV DNAs were amplified from metastatic pelvic lymph nodes in 13 patients of group I (42%) and from nonmetastatic lymph nodes in 7 group I patients (22.5%). Recurrence was identified in 9 group I patients (29.0%) in 3 years of follow-up. HPV DNAs were amplified from nonmetastatic lymph nodes in 11 group II patients (22.9%). Two group II patients, who had HPV-16 DNA by PCR in nonmetastatic nodes, were recurrent. PCNA was overexpressed in 66.7% of HPV-16- or -18-positive cervical cancers and 16.7% of HPV-16- or -18-negative cervical cancers. However, the expression levels of PCNA in cervical cancers were not influenced by the presence of oncogenic HPV DNA or pathologic metastasis in the pelvic lymph nodes. In conclusion, HPV DNA could be amplified from some metastatic and nonmetastatic pelvic lymph nodes and the detectability of oncogenic HPV DNA in pelvic lymph nodes may represent the poor outcome in the treatment of disease. The expression of PCNA protein which was associated with presence of oncogenic HPV DNAs in cervical cancers, suggesting activation of S phase of cell cycle, may contribute to the malignant progression by HPV-16 or -18."

The study highlighted the immense utility of cytological screening in minimizing the incidence of carcinoma cervix in the segment of the urban population screened, as the incidence dropped down to 0.5% in the second half from 1.1% noticed in the first half of the screening period. The study also emphasized the utility of clinically downstaging the cervical cancer as 7,316 women showing clinical lesions of cervix were found to harbor SIL in 15.3% and carcinoma cervix in 1.3% of cases as against the incidence of 2.5% for SIL and 0.6% for frank cancer in women with normal cervix. The investigation into different risk factors involved in cervical carcinogenesis revealed that the incidence of SIL and cancer cervix showed a rise with increasing age and parity and prolonged sexual period. The incidences of both cervical cytopathologies were also higher in women of low socio-economic status while religion was found to have no bearing on the occurrence of the disease. Among the four sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) diagnosed in the cervical smears, Trichomonas vaginalis was found to be more prevalent (2.6%), while human papillomavirus (HPV) and Herpes simplex was seen in 0.4 and 0.2% of cases, respectively Herpes simplex was found to have strong affinity with both SIL and carcinoma cervix, while only SIL incidence was high with HPV infection. The study emphasizes need of proper education to women of low socio-economic class for creating awareness regarding hazards and risk factors of cervical cancer as well as management and cure of the disease."
CD008054,0,16470857,1,High-risk human papillomavirus DNA testing: a marker for atypical glandular cells.,"Cervical/endocervical cytology screening has decreased morbidity and mortality, and implementing adjunctive human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance has improved the specificity for detecting premalignant squamous lesions. Currently, there are no guidelines to perform HPV DNA testing on cervical/endocervical ThinPreps with atypical glandular cells (AGC). To assess the potential role of HPV DNA testing on AGC cases, Hybrid Capture 2 (Digene Corp.) testing was performed on 144 cervical/endocervical AGC specimens. One hundred three of 144 cases had follow-up; 60/103 (58.3%) were high-risk HPV negative and 43/103 (42.3%) were high-risk HPV positive. Of 43 HPV-positive patients, 37 had adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), or cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, while only one patient without high-risk HPV had a squamous intraepithelial neoplasia. Furthermore, most high-risk HPV positive AGC cases harbored high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) rather than AIS. Our data support HPV DNA testing of all AGC specimens to detect cervical, especially squamous, neoplasia."

This is a randomized phase III, placebo-controlled study of hydralazine and valproate (HV) added to cisplatin topotecan in advanced cervical cancer. Patients received hydralazine at 182 mg for rapid, or 83 mg for slow acetylators, and valproate at 30 mg/kg, beginning a week before chemotherapy and continued until disease progression. Response, toxicity, and PFS were evaluated, and 36 patients (17 CT + HV and 19 CT + PLA) were included. The median number of cycles was 6. There were four PRs to CT + HV and one in CT + PLA. Stable disease in five (29%) and six (32%) patients, respectively, whereas eight (47%) and 12 (63%) showed progression (P = 0.27). At a median follow-up time of 7 months (1-22), the median PFS is 6 months for CT + PLA and 10 months for CT + HV (P = 0.0384, two tailed). Although preliminary, this study represents the first randomized clinical trial to demonstrate a significant advantage in progression-free survival for epigenetic therapy over one of the current standard combination chemotherapy in cervical cancer. Molecular correlates with response and survival from this trial are pending to analyze."

From 2001 to 2006 Croatian society for colposcopy and cervical pathology organised six courses ""Role of colposcopy in early diagnosis and prevention of premalignant lesions of the uterine cervix"" in cooperation with Medical faculty, University of Zagreb and the Croatian medical chamber. Leading presentations were focused on the epidemiology of cervical cancer, cytologic, colposcopic and pathohistologic classification, HPV testing and role of male partner. After the theoretical part, a series of colposcopic pictures were presented as a practical part of the course where attendees participated in colposcopic images description and estimation of what could be the underlying pathological process. Such, courses are needed for continued medical education and quality practice of colposcopy."
CD008054,0,17598512,0,Development of prophylactic HPV vaccines.,"Since several years it has been accepted that persistent infection with certain (so called-high risk: HR) types of Human papillomaviruses (HPV) represents a strong risk factor for cervical cancer. The most frequent HR HPV types 16 and 18 account for about 70% of this tumour, which is the second most frequent malignancy in women worldwide. Several studies in animal papillomavirus models revealed that protection against infection is conferred by neutralizing antibodies directed against conformational epitopes of the major structural protein L1. Such antibodies can most efficiently be induced by immunization with virus-like particles (VLP) that assemble spontaneously following expression of L1 in recombinant vectors. Large-scale production of HPV 16 and 18 VLPs proved to be successful facilitating, a few years ago, first clinical trials on safety and immunogenicity. In the meantime more than 25,000 women have been included into several efficacy trials which demonstrated protection against persistent infection with HPV 16 and 18 and against the development of precursor lesions to cervical cancer. Although the ultimate proof of success, i.e. reduction of cancer incidence still requires the immunization of large populations and many years of follow-up, the existing data are so persuasive that the responsible agencies in several countries permitted the licensing of the first HPV vaccine in 2006. Several questions such as the duration of protection, the need development of for post-exposure vaccination strategies and availability of such vaccine in low-budget countries are open and will be discussed."

There is an increasing interest regarding the role of HPV testing in the follow-up period after treatment for CIN.
CD008054,0,11827499,0,Evaluation and management of HIV-infected women.,"The rate of newly diagnosed AIDS in the United States is increasing fastest in women, who are infected with HIV primarily through heterosexual transmission. Approximately 60% of these women are African American, and 18% are Latina. A gynecologic infection is the most common symptom that leads to initial medical evaluation. Specific studies at baseline should include CD4 lymphocyte count, HIV-1 RNA level, and gynecologic examination with Papanicolaou smear. Decisions about initiation of antiretroviral therapy depend on the patient's clinical diagnoses, her willingness to adhere to treatment, and CD4 lymphocyte and HIV-1 RNA levels. Levels of HIV-1 RNA may be somewhat lower in women than in men at the same CD4 count, whereas women have higher CD4 lymphocyte counts at the time of AIDS diagnosis. However, prospective trials have not yet indicated the need to change the threshold CD4 lymphocyte counts or HIV-RNA levels for initiation of therapy in women. The efficacy of antiretroviral therapy appears to be similar in men and women, although women are more likely to experience toxicities. Abnormal Papanicolaou smears occur in approximately 40% of women at baseline, and 58% are infected with human papillomavirus. The prevalence of both conditions increases with lower CD4 lymphocyte counts and higher HIV-1 RNA levels. Precursor lesions to cervical cancer may be effectively treated, but almost 50% recur within 1 year, mandating careful follow-up. Referral should be sought for specialized gynecologic care and for issues related to HIV itself, since survival is prolonged in patients treated by physicians who are experienced in treating HIV. When they are provided the same access to care, HIV-infected women have similar prognoses as HIV-infected men."

This study was conducted to evaluate this stain detecting high-grade cervical disease, and results were compared with high-risk HPV (hr-HPV) status and histologic biopsy diagnosis in Papanicolaou tests with atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H) cytologic results. Cervical cytology specimens were collected in BD SurePath preservative (BD Diagnostics-Tripath), and 100 specimens with a diagnosis of ASC-H were included in the study. A second BD SurePath slide, prepared from the residual cellular material from these ASC-H cases, was immunostained using the BD ProEx C reagent. Nuclear staining of ASC-H cells was considered a positive result. The sensitivity for BD ProEx C for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or worse was 98.8% and for hr-HPV was 71.1%, whereas specificity values were 82.4% and 64.7%, respectively. BD ProEx C has potential as a marker for detection of high-grade disease in patients with ASC-H cytologic results."
CD008054,0,8483367,0,Squamous cell carcinoma in HIV-positive patients under age 45.,"Eight patients 45 years of age and under (range, 29 to 45) with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and infection with the human immunodeficiency virus are reported. Primary tumor sites include nasopharynx, oral cavity, oropharynx, and larynx. Probes for the human papillomavirus were positive in two of the patients. Therapy consisted of surgery followed by radiation therapy in five patients, surgery alone in one patient, and radiation therapy in the remaining two patients. Follow-up ranged up to 2 years and revealed four deaths, three patients alive without disease, and one patient recently posttreatment with residual disease. The significance of the presence of the human papillomavirus in these individuals remains to be determined. The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck under age 45 is low, and whether there may be a higher incidence in HIV-positive patients cannot be determined from this small series."
CD008054,0,19649389,0,Identification of occult metastases of medullary thyroid carcinoma by calcitonin measurement in washout fluid from fine needle aspiration of cervical lymph node.,"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) may occur sporadically or as a manifestation of an autosomal-dominant inherited syndrome, the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. DNA-based RET genotype analysis gained worldwide acceptance in the identification of asymptomatic gene carrier. MTC synthesize and secrete calcitonin, a well established tumor marker and postoperative level of serum calcitonin, indicates whether residual disease was left behind and whether reintervention is necessary. However, management is difficult when routine imaging studies for MTC are negative. This paper brings a report of an illustrative case of a patient with MTC diagnosed by molecular screening, who persisted with detectable levels of serum calcitonin after surgical procedure. After 48 months, an increase in serum calcitonin impelled us to investigate the disease focus. Cervical-US and calcitonin measurement in washout fluid from fine needle aspiration was successfully used to identify MCT metastasis in a lymph node, allowing appropriated reintervention and illustrating the potential clinical applicability of this method."

CD008054,0,19692327,1,Human papillomavirus testing for cervical cancer screening: results from a 6-year prospective study in rural China.,"Long-term follow-up evaluations of cervical screening approaches are limited in low-resource areas. This prospective study assessed the risk of future cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) associated with baseline human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytologic status. In rural China, 1,997 women were screened with 6 screening tests, including colposcopic evaluations, and underwent biopsies in 1999. In December 2005, 1,612 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 or less at baseline were rescreened by visual inspection, liquid-based cytology, and HPV-DNA testing. All women underwent colposcopy at follow-up, with biopsies taken from women with visually apparent lesions or cytologic abnormalities. Twenty women developed incident CIN2+. The crude relative risk of CIN2+ for baseline HPV-positive women was 52 (95% confidence interval: 12.1, 222.5). The crude relative risk of CIN2+ was 167 (95% confidence interval: 21.9, 1,265) for baseline and follow-up repeatedly HPV-positive women compared with repeatedly HPV-negative women. Among 1,374 baseline HPV-negative women, 2 and no incident CIN2+ cases were detected in baseline cytologically normal and abnormal subgroups, respectively. Among 238 baseline HPV-positive women, 6 of 18 incident cases of CIN2+ developed in the cytologically normal group. This study demonstrates that a single oncogenic HPV-DNA test is more effective than cytology in predicting future CIN2+ status."

CD008054,0,20873772,0,Secretome-based identification and characterization of potential biomarkers in thyroid cancer.,"In search of thyroid cancer biomarkers, proteins secreted by thyroid cancer cell lines, papillary-derived TPC-1 and anaplastic-derived CAL62, were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Of 46 high-confidence identifications, 6 proteins were considered for verification in thyroid cancer patients' tissue and blood. The localization of two proteins, nucleolin and prothymosin-Î± (PTMA), was confirmed in TPC-1 and CAL62 cells by confocal microscopy and immunohistochemically in xenografts of TPC-1 cells in NOD/SCID/Î³ mice and human thyroid cancers (48 tissues). Increased nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of PTMA was observed in anaplastic compared to papillary and poorly differentiated carcinomas. Nuclear expression of nucleolin was observed in all subtypes of thyroid carcinomas, along with faint cytoplasmic expression in anaplastic cancers. Importantly, PTMA, nucleolin, clusterin, cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61, enolase 1, and biotinidase were detected in thyroid cancer patients' sera, warranting future analysis to confirm their potential as blood-based thyroid cancer markers. In conclusion, we demonstrated the potential of secretome analysis of thyroid cancer cell lines to identify novel proteins that can be independently verified in cell lines, xenografts, tumor tissues, and blood samples of thyroid cancer patients. These observations support their potential utility as minimally invasive biomarkers for thyroid carcinomas and their application in management of these diseases upon future validation."

CD008054,0,18159534,0,The laboratory diagnosis of genital human papillomavirus infections.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the etiological agents of several genital cancers, including cancer of the uterine cervix. The detection of HPV infection in genital samples may increase the sensitivity of primary and secondary screenings of cervical cancer. HPV testing may also improve the specificity of screening programs, resulting in the avoidance of overtreatment and cost savings for confirmatory procedures. The major determinants of clinical progression of HPV infection include persistence of HPV infection, involvement of high-risk HPV types, high HPV viral load, integration of viral DNA and presence of several potential cofactors. Signal amplification HPV-DNA detection techniques (Hybrid Capture II, Digene Corporation, USA) are standardized, commercially available, and capable of detecting several high-risk HPV types. They also increase the sensitivity of screening for high-grade lesions in combination with cytology. The sensitivity of these techniques to detect high-grade lesions is higher than that of cytology, but the referral rate for colposcopy is greater. These techniques are approved for the triage to colposcopy of women with cervical smears interpreted as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. Triage and screening for cervical cancer using HPV will probably be restricted to women aged 30 years or older because of the high prevalence of infection in younger women. Amplification techniques are ideal for epidemiological studies because they minimize the misclassification of HPV infection status. These techniques can detect low HPV burden infections. Consensus primers amplify most genital types in one reaction, and the reverse hybridization of amplicons with type-specific probes allows for the typing of HPV-positive samples. Consensus PCR assays are currently under evaluation for diagnostic purposes. HPV testing is currently implemented for the clinical management of women."

CD008054,0,18199790,0,Homogeneous amplification of genital human alpha papillomaviruses by PCR using novel broad-spectrum GP5+ and GP6+ primers.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection and typing are important for diagnosis and management of HPV-associated diseases. One of the most commonly used PCR methods, GP5+/6+, shows weaknesses in amplifying certain types. To circumvent this limitation, we developed and validated broad-spectrum primers targeting the GP5+/6+ region. The addition of eight upstream and two downstream BSGP5+/6+ (BS) primers improved amplification of plasmids of 14 genital HPV types 10- to 1,000-fold versus GP5+/6+ PCR without altering sensitivity for the 10 others. For these 24 types, an analytic sensitivity of < or = 1,000 plasmid copies in the presence of 100 ng cellular DNA was obtained. Additionally, we integrated an internal beta-globin PCR into both HPV PCR systems, allowing simultaneous DNA quality control without affecting the sensitivity of HPV detection. Furthermore, we describe five additional low-risk HPV probes used in multiplex HPV genotyping (MPG) for simultaneous identification of all 15 high-risk, 3 putative high-risk, and 9 low-risk HPV genotypes. The performance of BSGP5+/6+ multiplexed with beta-globin primers was compared to that of standard GP5+/6+ with DNA from 1,112 cervical scrapings. There was 79% overall agreement (kappa = 0.816). BSGP5+/6+ was significantly more sensitive than GP5+/6+ for detection of HPV 30, 39, 42, 44, 51, 52, 53, 68, 73, and 82, detecting 212 additional HPV infections and increasing the proportion of multiple infections from 17.2 to 26.9% in cancer patients. In conclusion, BSGP5+/6+ multiplexed with beta-globin PCR provides an improvement in type-specific amplification sensitivity and homogeneity compared to GP5+/6+ and offers simultaneous internal control of DNA quality. BSGP5+/6+-MPG, therefore, is suitable for epidemiologic and also diagnostic applications."

CD008054,0,8706956,0,Spontaneous evolution of intraepithelial lesions according to the grade and type of the implicated human papillomavirus (HPV).,"Because of the fact that any meaningful classification should bear a close relationship to the biological behavior of the lesions, the usefulness of all new classifications of cervical precancer lesions can only be established by well controlled prospective follow-up studies. However, several methodological and conceptual problems are encountered in the natural history studies conducted during the past several decades. While reviewing the available prospective follow-up studies on cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), OstÃ¶r (1993) found 3529 cases of CIN 1, of which 57% showed regression, persistence was found in 32%, progression to CIN III in 11%, and progression to invasive cancer in 1% of cases. The corresponding figures for CIN II were 43%, 35%, 22%, and 5%, respectively. The recognition of the association between human papillomavirus (HPV) and CIN has further complicated the assessment of the natural history of cervical precancer lesions. Results from the early prospective follow-up studies are remarkably consistent, however. Progression from HPV-NCIN (i.e., koilocytosis without CIN) to CIN I or greater was reported for 18 (8%) of 232 women followed by SyrjÃ¤nen et al. for an average of 25 months, for 26 (8%) of 314 women followed by de Brux et al. (1981) for 15 to 18 months, and for 113 (13%) of 846 women followed for up to six years by Mitchell et al. During a 42-month follow-up period, 10% progression rate was found in 1269 women with HPV-CIN I, and in 17% of 762 women with HPV-CIN II by de Brux et al. (1983). The spontaneous regression rates were 53% and 39% in these cohorts, respectively. This is fully consonant with our experience from an almost 14-year follow-up of 530 women in Kuopio, where the spontaneous regression rate seems to increase in parallel with the extent of the follow-up time, currently being 66.7% for HPV-NCIN and 55.7% for HPV-CIN I. The figures for progression are 6.3% and 14.2%, respectively. It is obvious that the probability of a cervical precancer lesion to progress into an invasive disease increases with the severity of the atypia. Another distinct prognostic factor is HPV type, HPV 16 lesions possessing a significantly higher risk for progression than infections by other HPV types. The follow-up data also indicate, however, that even the high grade lesions may spontaneously regress, which should have important implications in therapy. The continuous problem still remains; these natural history observations only apply to a large series of women but are of little help in predicting the disease outcome in individual women."

CD008054,0,19369580,0,Nucleotide excision repair core gene polymorphisms and risk of second primary malignancy in patients with index squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.,"The nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is central in response to damage induced by environmental carcinogens. Efficiency of this pathway, probably genetically determined, may modulate individual risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) as well as second primary malignancy (SPM) after the index tumor. We hypothesized that common non-synonymous and regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NER core genes individually, and more probably collectively, associated with the risk of SPM. We genotyped for seven selected SNPs in 1376 incident SCCHN patients who were prospectively recruited between 1995 and 2006 and followed for SPM development. We found that 110 patients (8%) developed SPM: 43 (39%) second SCCHN; 38 (35%) other tobacco-associated sites and 29 (26%) other non-tobacco-associated sites. The associations of these SNPs with SPM risk were assessed assuming a recessive genetic model. We did not find any significant associations of each or in combination of the seven SNPs with SPM risk in the recessive models. However, when we explored the combined effect based on an alternatively dominant genetic model, we found that the number of observed risk genotypes was associated with a significantly increased SPM risk in a dose-response manner (P = 0.005) and patients with five to seven risk genotypes had a significantly 2.4-fold increased SPM risk compared with patients with zero to two risk genotypes. These findings suggest that a profile of NER core gene polymorphisms might collectively contribute to risk of SPM not in a recessive model but in a dominant model among patients with an index primary SCCHN. These findings need to be validated in future studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up time."
CD008054,0,17696746,1,Evaluation of primers and PCR performance on HPV DNA screening in normal and low grade abnormal cervical cells.,"High risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) are associated with increased risk of normal cervical cells developing to dysplasia and cervical carcinoma. Therefore, HR-HPV DNA testing can predict an endpoint of cervical carcinogenesis that is earlier than the development of cervical abnormalities. Not only the sensitivity of methods but also the amount of HPV DNA are very important and might be parameters to distinguish HPV detection. In this study, we evaluated the effects of primer sets and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performance with low viral load samples with normal cervical cytology (140 samples) and mild dysplasia (140 samples) using two consensus primers MY09/MY11 and GP5+/6+. The PCR was performed with single and nested PCR. Positive samples with both primer sets were then HPV genotyped by dot blot hybridization. Results showed higher sensitivity of single PCR using primer GP5+/GP6+ than primer MY09/MY11. HPV DNA was detected in 15% (21 of 140)and 20.7% (29 of 140) of normal cervical samples, respectively. For mild dysplasia samples, HPV DNA was detected in 37.1% (52 of 140) with MY09/MY11 and 50% (70 of 140) using GP5+/GP6+. In normal cervical samples, the positivity rate was increased to 38.5% (54 of 140) by nested PCR using primer GP5+/6+, but only 2 mild dysplasia samples that were negative by single GP5+/6+ were positive by auto-nested PCR. These results suggested that, in low viral load samples, the sensitivity of HPV DNA detection depends not only on primer sets but also PCR performance. HPV 16 was the most common in mild dysplasia samples (20.8%), whereas HPV type 58 was found in 11.1%. This study suggested that nested PCR might be necessary for HPV DNA detection in cervical samples of women participating in cervical cancer screening."

Smoking is associated with cervical cancer in HPV DNA-positive women, but its association with HPV persistence is unclear, particularly with respect to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serostatus. The authors evaluated smoking and HPV clearance by HIV serostatus among 801 women from the HIV Epidemiology Research Study (United States, 1993-2000). Type-specific HPV duration was defined as the interval between initial MY09/11 polymerase chain reaction positivity and the first of two consecutive HPV-negative study visits. Hazard ratios adjusted for study site and risk behaviors (sexual activity or injection drug use) were estimated using Cox regression. This analysis included 522 HIV-seropositive and 279 HIV-seronegative women (median follow-up, 4.4 years). Ever smoking was associated with reduced clearance of high-risk HPV in HIV-seronegative women (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30, 0.88) but not in HIV-seropositive women (HR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.65, 1.42); similar results were found for current smoking. Current smoking was not associated with clearance of any type-specific HPV in HIV-seropositive (HR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.82, 1.20) or HIV-seronegative (HR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.68, 1.26) women. HPV clearance did not appear to vary by amount or duration of smoking. Smoking did not modify overall clearance but was associated with lower high-risk HPV clearance in HIV-seronegative women."
CD008054,0,8980175,0,Analysis of IgG reactivity against Human Papillomavirus type-16 E7 in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia indicates an association with clearance of viral infection: results of a prospective study.,"IgG reactivity against the immunodominant region aa6-35 of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) type-16 E7 was determined in a peptide-based ELISA in a cohort study of women with initial mild to moderate cervical dyskaryosis. On the basis of HPV DNA patterns, as determined by PCR in cervical smears prior to IgG testing, HPV-16-positive patients were grouped as having either a cleared, a fluctuating, or a persistent HPV-16 infection. In a cross-sectional study at the start of serological follow-up, positive IgG reactivities were found more often in the total group of HPV-16-positive patients (20.0%) than in patients consistently typed as HPV-negative over a period of at least 12 months prior to testing (3.1%, p < 0.04). The highest proportion of positive responders was found in patients with a cleared HPV-16 infection (29.4%). Also, IgG reactivities found in HPV-16 clearance patients were significantly higher than in patients with a persistent infection (p < 0.008). In a subsequent longitudinal study over a period of up to 27 months, consistently positive reactivities were observed in patients with cleared viral infections who showed seroreactivity in the cross-sectional study, while mostly negative reactivities were found in patients with viral persistence. HPV-16 E7-specific IgG subclass responses were determined in a selection of 19 CIN and 11 HPV-16-positive cervical carcinoma (CeCa) patients with positive E7-specific IgG responses. IgG2 was predominant in the CIN patients, suggesting the presence of IFNgamma (Th1) at the site of HPV infection. In the CeCa patients IgG1 and IgG2 were produced equally, possibly indicating a rise in Th2 cytokines. Our data suggest that HPV-16 E7 IgG reactivity in a subset of CIN patients with viral clearance may result from successful Th1 responses."
CD008054,0,16232081,0,Cervical human papillomavirus screening by PCR: advantages of targeting the E6/E7 region.,"PCR is a promising method for detection of human papillomavirus (HPV), the high-risk forms of which are responsible for cervical cancer. PCR primers that target the L1 or E1 region can be unreliable and may miss more advanced disease, whereas those directed at the E6 or E7 regions, which encode oncogenic products, are preferable because 1) the LI/E1 regions, but never the E6/E7 regions, are lost during integration of viral DNA into host genomic DNA, a process that can represent an integral component of progression from infection to tumorigenesis; and 2) the E6/E7 nucleotide sequence exhibits less nucleotide variation. The choice of region used for PCR has implications for HPV screening strategies in the clinical diagnosis and management of cervical cancer."
CD008054,0,16670117,0,Genital warts in children: what do they mean?,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a diverse family of viruses, of which 30-40 genotypes specifically infect the genital tract. Genital HPVs are largely transmitted sexually, with most infections being asymptomatic and transient. In contrast, persistent infection with oncogenic genotypes in a minority is a strong risk factor, for subsequent development of high grade dysplasia, the precursor lesion to cervical neoplasia, which generally occurs after a long latency period. It is unknown whether there is a disease correlate in children chronically infected with oncogenic HPVs. Low risk HPV genotypes 6 and 11 are the primary cause of condylomata acuminata, although in children non-genital genotypes are also found in a proportion, with the mode of transmission being either perinatal, horizontal, or sexual. The finding of asymptomatic HPV DNA in children, and correlation with live virus, infectivity, or disease is unclear. Long term follow up for children with anogenital warts is recommended, although there are no longitudinal studies available to clarify whether they are at risk of developing carcinoma in young adulthood."
CD008054,0,11339256,0,Poor antibody response against human papillomavirus in adult-onset laryngeal papillomatosis.,"To investigate whether adult-onset laryngeal papillomatosis induces serum antibodies to the human papillomavirus (HPV), 60 patients underwent a clinical examination, and HPV DNA from their laryngeal biopsy was assayed by PCR and HPV serology with virus-like particles as the antigen. Patients and controls (n = 53) showed no differences in their HPV 6 and 16 antibodies. Patients more often had HPV 11 antibodies, female patients more often than female controls or male patients. Of the female patients, 5 of 15 had a history of genital condylomas and, at the follow-up visit, 5 of 9 had cervical cytology consistent with genital HPV infection. The fact that HPV antibodies did not correlate with clinical features of the laryngeal disease or with HPV DNA detected in the larynx, suggests that HPV antibodies in female patients were induced by genital rather than laryngeal HPV infection. The high prevalence of abnormal Pap smears indicates that gynaecological examination of female adult-onset laryngeal papilloma patients is warranted."
CD008054,0,18785808,0,Human papillomavirus testing for primary cervical cancer screening.,"Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide and the seventh most common cause of cancer deaths in women in Europe. Today, we know how to prevent almost every case of this disease; organized cervical cancer screening based on the Papanicolaou or Pap smear has been proven to prevent 80% of cervical cancer deaths, while new technologies for the detection of the human papillomavirus (HPV) or the prevention of HPV infection offer the potential to make even more progress in the battle against this disease. Testing for carcinogenic or high-risk HPV types is gaining acceptance for the triage of women with borderline cytology and for follow-up after treatment of high-grade cervical lesions. Now, a number of large-scale randomized controlled trials have shown that HPV testing as a primary screening test can detect approximately 50% more high-grade lesions than the Pap test, albeit with a lower specificity if all HPV-positive women are followed up. However, alternative screening algorithms in which HPV-positive women are triaged with cytology have been shown to have equivalent specificity to the Pap test without compromising the increased sensitivity. Further advantages of HPV testing come from the fact that it is an objective and automatable test with a dichotomous result. These attributes can yield cost savings through reductions in staff numbers and simplification of quality control procedures while reducing turnaround times. In countries seeking to improve cervical cancer prevention, the implementation of HPV testing as the primary screening test with cytology for the triage of HPV-positive women is an option that should be fully evaluated. This review summarizes the recent advances in HPV testing in cervical cancer prevention."
CD008054,0,12469172,0,"Detection of CK19, CK20 and EGFR mRNAs in peripheral blood of carcinoma patients: correlation with clinical stage of disease.","Expression of genes such as cytokeratin 19 (CK19), cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been investigated at mRNA level in peripheral blood of carcinoma patients to detect the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTC). We performed this study because recent literature emphasizes that the importance of CK19, 20 and EGFR mRNAs in CTC as prognostic factors remains unclear especially for breast, head and neck and colon cancer patients. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by Southern blot hybridization was performed in blood samples from 47 subjects (12 colorectal, 15 head and neck and 20 breast carcinoma patients), as well as in 35 healthy donors. The CK19 expression was found in 36/47 patients (9 colorectal, 9 head and neck and 18 breast cancer), two patients (one affected by colorectal and one by head and neck cancer) were positive for CK20 whereas EGFR was found expressed in 9 patients (3 colorectal, 5 head and neck and one breast cancer). Seven of 35 and 4/35 healthy donors displayed positivity for the expression of CK19 and CK20 genes respectively, whereas no EGFR mRNA was found in this group. The correlation of the detection of CTC in peripheral blood with progression of the disease in a follow-up period of 40 months did not show any prognostic value to the presence of mRNAs of these biomarkers in blood. We believe that research should be addressed, at least for breast cancer, to the identification of occult metastases in sentinel lymph nodes, such as recently performed in melanoma patients."
CD008054,0,12114162,0,Teaching residents humanistic skills in a colposcopy clinic.,"The aim of this project is to add formal training and evaluation of humanistic skills for residents in a colposcopy clinic. Medical education of residents in office procedures has generally focused on proficiency in a particular technical skill and acquisition of clinical knowledge regarding management options. The literature supports assessing pattern recognition with visual images and observing a specific number of procedures to achieve proficiency. Little attention has been given to training residents to demonstrate sensitivity during procedures. However, we believe this is a key element, as the procedure involves anxious patients who are fearful of cancer and fearful of pain in their most private body parts. Further, women who have painful or unpleasant colposcopy procedures are less likely to follow up for further evaluation of treatment and may be at higher risk to develop cervical cancer."
CD008054,0,17177657,0,"Efficacy in treatment of cervical HRHPV infection by combination of beta interferon, and herbal therapy in woman with different cervical lesions.","Cervical dysplasia, a premalignant lesion that can progress to cervical cancer, is caused primarily by a sexually transmitted infection with an oncogenic strain of the human papillomavirus (HPV). The HPV infections are treated through destroying the clinical lesions: laser, cryotherapy, podophyllin... The hope is that by causing local tissue inflammation that the body will be stimulated to mount an antibody response and thereby prevent recurrence. In contrast to other prevention approaches, vaccines can reduce susceptibility in uninfected partners by stimulating the immune system. Aloe vera has also been reported to retard tumour growth and stimulate the immune response to viruses. A list of possible actions of propolis includes: antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antithrombotic and immunomodulatory. Research on the possible role of some B vitamins in preventing cancer began in the last few decades, but however this complex have an influence on immune status. The aim of our study is to try to treat the HPV infection as confirmed cause of neoplastic transformation with some herbal therapy and interferon and to try define the guidelines in the management of the HPV positive patients. Goal of this paper is to search for evidence of efficacy of any treatment for HPV infection of the cervix mostly in woman with no concomitant CIN. Fifty five woman affected by HPV genital infection were enrolled in the study from September 2005 to April 2006. Patients were classified according to the results of the HPV testing prior and after the therapy. Patients were randomized into two groups: the first group was HPV positive woman treated with other than recommended therapy (n=20), (control group); the second group was pharmacologically treated with intravaginal administration of an interferon and aloe vera-propolis in recommended scheme (n=35) with treatment of the possible fungal or bacterial genital infection prior to the specific therapy. The almost same therapy was recommended to the male partner. Patients from the second group used B complex during the therapy. Patients were retested for the HPV presence after three or six month from therapy depend of the presence bacterial or fungal genital coinfection. Three months after applied therapy HPV infection was still present in more than 90% of the patients in the first group. In the second group treated according to the recommended therapy scheme HPV infection disappeared in 71.42% of the patients after three months and in 100% of patients after six months. Samples of the cervical smear for the HPV analysis were being taken during routine gynecological examinations, by using sticks with cotton, taken from the Digene Specimen Collection Kit, from the whole surface of a portion, and by mild rotating moves from the outer cervical entrance. Our results suggest that the combination of interferon and herbal therapy with B complex is effective, atraumatic and simple non-surgical treatment of HPV infection. Since prospective efficacy trials will take several years to complete, considering alternative approaches is also worthwhile."
CD008054,0,11449625,0,[Cancer register for cervix carcinoma--useful and necessary?].,"During the last two decades, cancer research has shifted from using cell lines and animal models to using methods and models that use human tissues from defined tumors. DNA and RNA can be analysed from fresh tissue from samples obtained at surgery, biopsy, cytologies or necropsy as well as from paraffin-embedded material. Archival material has several advantages: not only it is from individuals for whom disease process has been documented, but also data may available about the outcome as well as the response to treatment. Material available from well-controlled clinical trails would enable a wide range of hypotheses to be tested. Laser microdissection allows to sample cellular material from histopathologic well documented areas of the tumor, including special differentiated areas. It is necessary to establish tumor registries, especially in gynecologic oncology to get material from well described tumors for molecular profiling, the molecular analysis of clonality in tumors and malignant progression. At the Leipzig University a cervical tumor registry has been established in March 1979. Until the end of December of the year 2000 1,030 cases of surgically treated cervical cancer from stage pT1b1 up to pT2b including paraffin blocks and original histologic slides were collected. First evaluation up to the end of 1996 (n = 919) has shown, that 27.2% of the patients represented with histological proven pelvic lymph node metastases. The majority of cases were staged pT1b1 (52.1%), followed by stage pT2b (23.9%), pT1b2 (9.7%) and pT2a (9.5%). In 44 cases stage was not documented. In about 95.2% datas about the follow up of the patients were available. In conclusion, tumor registries are helpful in establishing and controlling uniform criteria for the accurate determination of prognostic factors and exact histopathologic evaluation can ideally be combined with new tools in molecular pathology, i.e. histopathology meets genomics."
CD008054,0,17550135,0,Patients with malignant or pre-malignant cervical lesion have increased risk of becoming hepatitis B carrier.,"Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) are known aetiology of cervical and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Both diseases share a similar clinical course, that is, the vast majority of those infected by these two viruses can eradicate the viruses spontaneously. A small sub-group who fails to clear the virus becomes chronic carrier and can progress to carcinoma many years later. We postulated that patients with pre-malignant or malignant cervical lesion are at increased risk of becoming chronic HBV carrier if infected, which may be attributed to inherent immunological deficiency against viral infection. We tested HBV carrier status from 288 patients with cervical carcinoma, 242 patients with high grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 311 women with neither of the above conditions as control subjects. The HBV carrier rate in the Cancer Group, CIN Group and Control Group was 21.4%, 24.1% and 10.6%. The carrier rate was significantly higher in both the Cancer Group (p<0.01) and the CIN Group (p<0.01), compared to the Control Group. Our study suggests that a common immunological mechanism is involved in eradication of HBV and HPV infections and inherent immuno-deficiency might lead to an association of HBV carrier status with cervical carcinoma. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and delineate the mechanism involved."

We performed a study in Santa Elena, Guayas (currently Santa Elena Province), Ecuador, to determine how often HPV could be detected in women attending a private cancer screening clinic. Participants underwent a Pap test, and vaginal and cervical swabs were performed for HPV testing by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Each participant completed a verbally administered survey. The mean age of 302 participants was 37.7 years (range 18 to 78 years). The majority of cervical and vaginal specimens contained sufficient DNA to perform PCR. Overall, 24.2% of the participants had either a cervical or vaginal swab that tested positive for HPV. In general, there was a good correlation between the HPV types detected in the cervical and vaginal swabs from the participants, but vaginal swabs were more likely to contain HPV DNA than were cervical swabs. The high-risk HPV types 16, 52, 58, and 59 and the low-risk HPV types 62, 71, 72, and 83 were the most frequently detected HPV types. The number of lifetime sexual partners was positively associated with detection of any HPV type, detection of oncogenic HPV, and abnormal Pap smears. Further studies are needed to determine if these results are representative of all Ecuadorian women and to determine if cervical cancers in Ecuadorian women are caused by the same HPV types found in the swab specimens obtained in this study."
CD008054,0,15859309,0,Clinical relevance of human papillomavirus testing in cytopathology.,"Cancer of the uterine cervix is the second most common cancer in women worldwide. Currently, cervical screening is based on cytology alone. Because infection with high-risk human papillomavirus types (hrHPVs) is a necessary cause of cervical cancer, it has been postulated that screening might become more efficient when it is based on combined cytology and hrHPV testing. In this review we will discuss the advantages of added HPV tests in cervical cancer screening, as a quality control for false-negative smears, in triage of women with equivocal smears, in follow-up of women treated for CIN3 or cervical cancer and for the detection of cervical adenocarcinoma."

CD008054,0,18086908,0,Human papillomavirus infections in primary care.,"Cervical cancer continues to be a leading cause of mortality worldwide. The incidence and mortality associated with invasive cervical cancer have declined significantly in developed countries due to widespread availability of screening with the Papanicolaou (Pap) test. However, the incidence and prevalence of non-invasive cervical intraepithelial neoplasms and genital warts related to oncogenic and nononcogenic strains of human papilloma viruses (HPV) have remained relatively stable. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics have resulted in improved characterization of various HPV types and have led to changes in terminology of Pap test findings. Changes in nomenclature may lead to confusion among primary care providers regarding how best to further evaluate abnormal cytological results. This article provides a concise overview of the approach to the treatment of genital warts and management of abnormal cervical cytology based on guidelines from the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology. It also reviews advances in HPV vaccine development and the new recombinant vaccine recently approved for use in the United States."
CD008054,0,9416366,0,Natural history and spectrum of disease in adults with HIV/AIDS in Africa.,"Progression from seroconversion to the development of AIDS in Africa may be shorter than in industrialized countries, but there are insufficient data to be certain. Although the data are not always directly comparable, survival after an AIDS diagnosis appears to be substantially shorter in African countries and this may be partly because of later diagnosis of AIDS in Africa, but may also be because of environmental factors such as increased exposure to pathogens of high virulence and lack of access to care. Tuberculosis and bacterial infections are the most important causes of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients. Bacteraemia is frequent, particularly due to non-typhoid salmonellae and S. pneumoniae. Cryptosporidia and I. belli are the most frequently isolated pathogens in patients with diarrhoea; non-typhoid salmonellae and Shigella species are also commonly isolated when stool cultures are performed. Cerebral toxoplasmosis, and meningitis due to Cryptococcus, tuberculosis and bacterial pathogens are the most frequent neurological infections and cognitive changes are frequently identified when specifically looked for. Infections with atypical mycobacteria and Pneumocystis carinii are rare, as is CMV retinitis. In women, HIV infection is associated with cervical human papillomavirus and with SIL, although there is currently no evidence for an association with invasive cervical cancer. Individuals infected with HIV-2 progress to AIDS and to death more slowly than those infected with HIV-1, but seem to experience the same spectrum of opportunistic disease when they reach the stage of advanced disease. The limited data available suggest that HIV-infected individuals in Africa develop opportunistic disease at broadly the same level of immunosuppression as do individuals in industrialized countries, but death occurs at a higher range of CD4 counts, although still in the range consistent with advanced disease. Data are still lacking concerning the aetiology of common clinical presentations of HIV disease and the relative frequencies of specific opportunistic diseases in different regions, particularly from southern Africa. Tuberculosis is the single most important HIV-related opportunistic infection in African countries, but diagnosis, particularly of extrapulmonary disease, remains difficult. The lack of laboratory facilities makes the diagnosis of bacterial infections difficult in many parts of the continent and, since this situation is unlikely to change in the near future, clinical algorithms for syndromic management need to be evaluated. More information is needed about gynaecological disease in HIV-infected women. The most important research questions concern the development and evaluation of cost-effective regimes for prophylaxis and treatment of opportunistic disease in order to prolong healthy life in HIV-infected individuals."
CD008054,0,12394242,0,Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and uterine cervical cancer: a screening strategy in the perspective of rural India.,"The predominance of cervical cancer in India can mostly be attributed to the lack of early screening. The objective of the present study has been, therefore, to determine a cost-effective oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV)-based cervical cancer screening plan for rural Indian women. The results showed that in normal women, highest prevalence of HPV 16/18 infection was in the age group < or =23 years and lowest in > or =44 years with an insignificant change in between. HPV 16/18 infection was significantly associated with cervical erosion at age < or =23 years, but not with cytology or visual inspection with acetic acid testing at any age. The low-grade cytological lesions, however, increased only with increase in age. Fourteen per cent of the cervical malignancy was also found to be present in the age group 24-33 years with an 87% HPV infection. Here we proposed a cost-effective screening scheme in which HPV testing must be performed in women (a) < or =23 years with cervical erosion and (b) 24-43 years, as an adjunct to Pap smears (both HPV and cytology were prevalent in this group). For women > or =44 years, HPV testing might not be useful, since abnormal cytology was more prominent over the viral infection. We infer that by not performing HPV test in the group < or =23 years, approximately 76% of the high-risk HPV-infected individuals potentially ""at risk"" for developing cervical cancer might be missed."

A total of 291 patients were examined. 172 (59%) were found to have cutaneous warts, and 64 (21.9%) had non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). The proportion of patients with both warts and NMSC increased with time from transplantation: 40% of patients who had been transplanted for more than 9 years had NMSC. Fifteen patients had extensive dysplastic change in all sun-exposed areas, particularly the dorsal aspect of the hands. This subgroup of patients develop large numbers of tumours, particularly squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and require close surveillance and frequent surgery. One patient has died as a result of rapidly evolving metastases from an SCC on the dorsum of the hand. Excision and grafting of the backs of the hands in four patients, and long term etretinate therapy in 6 patients have led to a marked reduction in the frequency of surgery to remove tumours. The very high rate of NMSC, frequently multiple, found in this study of UK residents is a source of concern and indicates the need for close dermatological monitoring of allograft recipients, with intensive surveillance of patients with extensive dysplasia, who may develop tumours requiring surgery every few weeks."

The etiology comprises germline mutations of now 6 genes. About 10 years known are the RET gene susceptible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, the VHL gene for von Hippel-Lindau Disease, and the NF 1 gene for neurofibromatosis Recklinghausen (neuro- fibromatosis type 1). Since 2000 the genes for succinatedehydrogenase subunits SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD have been identified for paraganglioma syndromes type 4, type 3, and type 1 respectively. Investigations of series of pheochromocytoma patients identified germline mutations in one of the genes SDHB, SDHD, VHL and RET in 24% to 50% of the patients. Multifocal tumors, young age and positive family history, known features associated with inheritence, have not been present in all patients. Therefore, analyses of blood DNA for mutations in these genes are recommended. Positive tests provide the patients and their relatives with essential platforms for clinical care. Experiences in this field of medicine have shown that optimal management of patients with pheochromocytoma-associated syndromes is a high challenge. National registries may be instrumental in order to provide with adequate facilities."

However, less data exist concerning the duration of protection afforded by a negative HPV test compared to a normal cytological outcome. Here we report the long-term findings from the Hammersmith study in women aged 35 or more. HPV testing by Hybrid Capture II was performed on all available samples from the baseline screening visit. Passive surveillance of subsequent cytology screening results for the 2,982 women in the study was undertaken using a national registry. Histological outcomes were sought for all women with abnormal smears. The primary outcome was duration of protection against histologically confirmed CIN2+ afforded by a negative HPV test compared to normal cytology. 2,516 women had at least one further smear at least 1 year after entry and 20 new cases of CIN2+ were identified during a median follow-up of 6.4 years. Including disease identified at baseline, the risk of developing CIN2+ at 1, 5 and 9 years after a normal cytology was 0.33%, 0.83% and 2.20% respectively whereas it was 0.19%, 0.42% and 1.88% after a negative HPV test. HPV testing offered excellent protection from CIN2+ for at least 6 years after a negative test, whereas the protection from cytology began to wane after about 3 years. Substantially more CIN2+ lesions were found in the follow-up period in those initially HPV positive compared to those HPV negative (HR = 6.52, p = 0.001), whereas there was little difference according to initial cytology (HR = 1.64, p = 0.51)."

Prevention of cervical cancer by detecting the disease process at an early and pre-malignant stage is practised globally either through population-based screening programmes (PSP) or through non-organised ones. High-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) detected by cervical cytological screening is extensively visualised by colposcopy and successively treated by, for instance, large loop electro-surgical excision of the transformation zone. Persistent infections with certain high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) genotypes play an essential role in cervical cancer carcinogenesis by mechanisms discussed in this review. HPV assessment, either DNA detection or HPV genotyping, could enhance the current cervical cancer screening programmes. Furthermore, primary prevention of cervical cancer through the introduction of HPV vaccines looks promising although the current vaccines merely protect against two hr-HPV genotypes, leaving a niche for at least 11 other hr-HPV's. Cervical screening in the post-vaccination era cannot be abolished but could be altered, as discussed in this review.

CD008054,0,12478669,0,Viral load as a predictor of the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"HPV infections are believed to be a necessary cause of cervical cancer. Viral burden, as a surrogate indicator for persistence, may help predict risk of subsequent SIL. We used results of HPV test and cytology data repeated every 4-6 months in 2,081 women participating in a longitudinal study of the natural history of HPV infection and cervical neoplasia in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Using the MY09/11 PCR protocol, 473 women were positive for HPV DNA during the first 2 visits. We retested all positive specimens by a quantitative, low-stringency PCR method to measure viral burden in cervical cells. Mean viral loads and 95% CIs were calculated using log-transformed data. RRs and 95% CIs of incident SIL were calculated by proportional hazards models, adjusting for age and HPV oncogenicity. The risk of incident lesions increased with viral load at enrollment. The mean number of viral copies/cell at enrollment was 2.6 for women with no incident lesions and increased (trend p = 0.003) to 15.1 for women developing 3 or more SIL events over 6 years of follow-up. Compared to those with <1 copy per cell in specimens tested during the first 2 visits, RRs for incident SIL increased from 1.9 (95% CI 0.8-4.2) for those with 1-10 copies/cell to 4.5 (95% CI 1.9-10.7) for those with >1,000 copies/cell. The equivalent RR of HSIL for >1,000 copies/cell was 2.6 (95% CI 0.5-13.2). Viral burden appears to have an independent effect on SIL incidence. Measurement of viral load, as a surrogate for HPV persistence, may identify women at risk of developing cervical cancer precursors."
CD008054,0,19319944,0,Demographic and risk factors in patients with head and neck tumors.,"The association between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the development of head and neck cancer has been documented recently. In this study on 86 head and neck cancer patients and 124 controls, data regarding demographics, behavioral risk factors, and risks related to HPV exposure were collected. HPV detection was carried out using polymerase chain reaction in the tumors and in oral exfoliated cells, and HPV typing by a reverse line blot assay specific for 37 HPV types. Sera were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for HPV proteins. Head and neck cancer cases report significantly more oral-anal contact (P = 0.02) and tobacco and alcohol use than controls (P = 0.001; P = 0.02, respectively). High-risk HPV DNA was detected in 43% of oral washings of cases and 4% of controls (P < 0.0001). The association between the presence of high-risk HPV DNA in oral exfoliated cells and in tumor tissues was statistically significant (adjusted P < 0.0001). The prevalence of HPV-specific antibodies was significantly higher in cases than in controls (adjusted P < 0.0001). These results provide epidemiological and immunological evidence for HR HPV as a strong risk factor (OR = 44.3, P < 0.0001) for head and neck cancer, even after controlling for age, tobacco and alcohol use. The detection of high-risk HPV DNA in oral exfoliated cells and HPV-specific antibodies in serum can be considered as clinically relevant surrogate markers for the presence of a HPV-associated head and neck cancer, with a high sensitivity (83%) and specificity (88%)."
CD008054,0,19835740,0,"Cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx in young females: increasing incidence, role of human papilloma virus, and lack of survival improvement.","From 1975 to the mid 1990s, the incidence of cancer in the oral cavity and pharynx (OC/P) declined substantively, in large part because of successful educational and medical campaigns to reduce cigarette smoking and tobacco chewing. Recent data, however, suggest that the incidence trend in young adults has reversed. The current study investigated National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results databases for changes in the incidence of and survival from OC/P cancer. Since the mid 1990s, females in the United States, between 10 and 40 years of age, have had a steady, apparently accelerating, increase in the incidence of these cancers, particularly in females 15-34 years of age. Most of the increase occurred in the salivary glands and tongue, and were of squamous, acinar, and mucoepidermoid morphologic types. All racial/ethnic groups evaluated have shown the incidence trend pattern, with the increase most prominent in non-Hispanic whites. Five-year survival rates for females 15-39 years of age, when diagnosed to have OC/P cancer, show no improvement since 1975. In contrast, older females and males of all ages continue to demonstrate a reduction in incidence and improvement in survival. The observed patterns are consistent with changing sexual mores and increasing orogenital sexual practices in the United States, with transmission of human papillomavirus and potentially other sexually transmitted carcinogenic vectors. If so, the human papillomavirus vaccines will have cancer prevention benefits beyond cervical carcinoma and will be needed increasingly as the incidence of head and neck cancer is projected to continue to rise in young women."

CD008054,0,11433694,0,[Epidemiology of cervical papillomavirus infections. Recent knowledge].,"GENERAL DATA: There is now considerable evidence that high risk human papillomaviruses (HPV), such as HPV 16, are closely associated with cancer of the cervix. HPVs that are primarily transmitted through sexual contact, are found in over 99% of the cases of invasive cervical cancer. Although most women can be infected during their sexual life, a small minority is at risk for developing cancer. The long latency period between primary infection and cancer emergence suggests that additional factors are involved in the process of tumor development: sexual behavior, immune status, genetic predispositions, nutritional status, tobacco use, socio-economical level. NATURAL HISTORY: HPVs infect epithelial cells of the transformation zone of the cervix. As with other sexually transmitted diseases, the incidence of HPV infection is highest among young women. However, this viral infection is more often than not transient, because most individuals develop an effective type-specific immune response. Approximately 1% of the population has genital warts and 4% of women have cervical precancerous lesions: low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL) or high grade SIL. These last lesions preferentially observed in women aged 35-40 yrs are at high risk of progression towards an invasive cancer. ONCOGENIC POTENTIAL OF HPV: Pre-malignant and malignant cells arise as a result of HPV DNA integration in the host cellular genome, and overexpression of the viral E6 and E7 oncogenes. Cells acquire a proliferative advantage by escaping growth control exerted by p53 and p 105Rb. Both cellular proteins are indeed inactivated respectively by E6 and E7 proteins. Aneuploidy and karyotypic abnormalities are also key events in the tumor progression. A PREVENTABLE DISEASE: Cervical cancer is more than ever a preventable disease. While waiting for clinically applicable vaccination programs, strategies to prevent cervical cancer include 1) improved screening covering the widest possible population and using HPV testing, 2) close management and follow-up of women with precancerous lesions."

CD008054,0,17219448,0,Human papillomavirus testing and molecular markers of cervical dysplasia and carcinoma.,"Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the etiologic agent for the vast majority of premalignant and malignant lesions, and high-risk HPV types can be detected in almost all cases of cervical dysplasia and carcinoma. HPV testing has been widely adopted for the triage of patients after a cervical cytology screening test (Papanicolaou smear or liquid-based cervical cytology such as ThinPrep or SurePath) interpretation of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), and HPV testing is increasingly used for screening in conjunction with cervical cytology. Although cervical cytology is a highly effective screening test for cancer, it has limited specificity for clinically significant lesions in cases with low-grade cytologic abnormalities. Up to a quarter of all patients may have a false-negative result on the basis of cervical cytology testing alone. This review focuses on HPV testing methods and molecular markers and their clinical relevance. HPV testing and surrogate molecular markers of HPV infection (p16INK4a) may help identify cases that are associated with underlying high-grade premalignant or malignant lesions and may also reduce aggressive treatment of patients with low-grade lesions."

Treatment consisted of ifosfamide 1500 mg/m2 in 1000 ml saline, infused over 60 min and mesna 20% of the total dose of ifosfamide in three doses for 3 days combined with mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 given as a short infusion on day 1. Treatment courses were repeated every 4 weeks until a total of six cycles. Twenty-two patients entered this trial, 13 of whom had received chemo- and radiation therapy, and nine patients who underwent radiation therapy with or without prior surgery. We observed no objective response, with the exception of two patients who experienced minor response (reduction of tumor size of 25%). The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression with grade 3/4 leukocytopenia in seven patients (32%) and grade 3/4 neutropenia in 15 (68%). Severe organ toxicity except alopecia (91%) was not observed. Ifosfamide combined with mitoxantrone does not improve the therapeutic armentarium in recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck."
CD008054,0,14560531,0,Atypical squamous cells: update on current concepts.,"Besides all the confusion and associated problems that the use of ASC has created, it has initiated substantial investigational interest that has resulted in a better understanding of squamous intraepithelial lesions and the biology of cervical neoplasia. Although the category of ASC has created, and will continue to create, controversy in the diagnostic and management fields, it allows the pathologist to convey uncertainty that may be the result of poor sampling or difficulty in interpretation of a case. It is a valuable tool that the cytopathologist can use to make it known that the Papanicolaou test has its limitations and may need and benefit, in some instances, from support from ancillary studies. Similar limitations are recognized in other areas of pathology and the use of immunohistochemistry or molecular studies is widely accepted as an aid to a more specific and definitive interpretation. The time for the Papanicolaou test to be considered similarly has arrived. HPV DNA testing may not be the perfect test for cervical cancer screening because of high prevalence of HPV infection in the general population; however, it is currently the best-studied ancillary test and has been proven to be cost-effective for the triage of Papanicolaou tests with equivocal squamous cells. It is important for the cytopathologist to have well-developed diagnostic skills in interpreting gynecologic preparations, and to classify cases as ASC only when deemed appropriate. Downgrading cytologic findings that are diagnostic of a squamous intraepithelial lesion to ASC with the hope of supporting it by an HPV test will only result in a devaluation of the Papanicolaou test. Such recourse may, however, be acceptable in specific situations, such as in patients who have complex histories, atypical clinical presentations, or during pregnancy. Quality assurance measures to closely monitor the ASC:SIL ratio and the rate of HPV positivity in ASC cases will be essential to ensure the appropriate use of this interpretive category. The coordination of the 2001 Bethesda and ASCCP consensus meetings resulted in the new subcategories of ASC-US and ASC-H, along with well-defined management strategies for these interpretations. This new and clinically relevant terminology should lead to a reduction in difficulties at the clinical level and a more uniform management of patients, unlike the situation following Bethesda 1991 where the gynecologist was faced with a new ""diagnosis"" without specific management recommendations. The standardization of reporting and clinical management will also allow more reliable evaluation of patient outcomes and cost analysis. The 2002 American Cancer Society guidelines did not make specific recommendations regarding HPV DNA testing for the triage of patients who have a cytology result of ASC-US [64]. The FDA approved the expanded use of HPV testing in conjunction with the Papanicolaou test for cervical cancer screening in March of 2003. The future is likely to bring additional testing modalities that may be more specific for detecting squamous lesions that are more likely to persist or progress to carcinoma, than the currently available HPV tests. In addition, looking to the more distant future, recently published data from HPV vaccine trials suggests that immunizing women who are negative for HPV-16 may eventually reduce the incidence of cervical cancer [65]. At the present, however, the most effective method to decrease the mortality of this disease process is to make sure that all women have access to, and receive, effective cervical cytologic screening."
CD008054,0,8311108,0,Role of human immunodeficiency virus infection in the pathogenesis of human papillomavirus-associated cervical neoplasia.,"Although many basic questions about the relationship between HIV and HPV infection remain unresolved, epidemiological studies have consistently shown a strong association between HIV infection and the development of HPV-related squamous intraepithelial neoplasia. This work indicates that HIV infection may promote the clinical manifestation of subclinical or latent HPV infection. Recent technical advances localizing virus DNA and gene products in situ will provide new avenues for investigation, allowing us to go beyond correlations and to clarify the mechanisms of interaction between the two viruses in individual patients. With improved antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis for HIV-associated opportunistic infection and prolonged survival of women with HIV, HPV infection and its most serious consequence, cervical cancer, are likely to assume greater significance in the clinical management of HIV-infected women throughout the world. A better understanding of the role of HIV in promoting the clinical manifestation of HPV infection will be essential to the control of this disease."

Due to a lack of information available to women about the causes of the disease, accessibility of screening programs, and limitations to the existing screening techniques, cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women worldwide. Detection and follow-up of pre-cancer stages of the disease are based on the Pap test, which is now well established as a basic method of secondary prevention. Relative low sensitivity of the Pap test has initiated the development of additional technologies and methods towards enhanced screening quality and error elimination not only in the process of sample taking and analysis but also in screening and interpretation. Immunocytochemical methods and liquid based cytology are the new diagnostics possibilities in secondary prevention. In order to decrease morbidity, thus mortality too, it is necessary that the primary prevention (vaccination) be also implemented."

CD008054,0,20606041,0,No association between endogenous retinoic acid and human papillomavirus clearance or incident cervical lesions in Brazilian women.,"Although oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infections have been established as the necessary cause of cervical cancer, most HPV infections are transient and rarely progress to squamous cervical lesions. The activity of HPV is tightly associated with epithelial cell differentiation; therefore, regulators of differentiation, such as retinoic acid (RA), have been considered targets for the prevention of HPV-associated squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) development. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between circulating RA and early events in cervical carcinogenesis, specifically type-specific HPV clearance and SIL detection. Archived blood samples from 643 women participating in the Ludwig-McGill Cohort in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography for three RA isomers (all-trans, 13-cis, and 9-cis-RA). A type-specific HPV clearance event was defined as two consecutive visits negative for an HPV type during follow-up for 364 HPV-positive women. Among the 643 women in this analysis, 78 were diagnosed with incident SIL. The probability of clearing an oncogenic HPV infection was not significantly different across RA isomer quartiles. There was a suggestion that increasing all-trans-RA increased the rate of nononcogenic HPV clearance (P-trend = 0.05). There was no association observed between serum RA levels and incident SIL. Our results suggest that elevated circulating RA isomer levels do not increase the rate of HPV clearance or reduce the risk of incident SIL. The role of RA in the inhibition of HPV-induced carcinogenesis, as shown in vitro, lacks confirmatory evidence within epidemiologic studies among women."
CD008054,0,7819352,0,The role of early colposcopy in the management of females with first episode anogenital warts.,"212 females attending a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic with first episode anogenital warts were screened by cervical cytology and colposcopy/histology for the presence of cervical epithelial abnormalities in keeping with infection by the human papillomavirus (HPV infection) and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The prevalence of cervical epithelial abnormalities detected by cervical cytology alone was 32%, rising to 56% after colposcopic examination. However, the majority of cervical lesions detected by colposcopy alone were of low grade (HPV infection and/or CIN I). Histologically-confirmed high grade cervical lesions (CIN II or CIN III) were detected more frequently in those females in whom cervical cytological examination indicated dyskaryosis in keeping with any grade of CIN, compared to females without dyskaryotic changes on cervical smear (P < 0.05, chi-squared test with Yates' correction). Early colposcopy is indicated for females with anogenital warts in the presence of a cervical smear showing dyskaryosis in keeping with any grade of CIN, because of the statistically significant increased risk of detecting a potentially progressive high grade cervical lesion. In females without dyskaryotic changes on cervical smear, the value of early colposcopy is uncertain and warrants larger more long-term trials."
CD008054,0,8914160,0,Gynecological neoplasias in the patient with HIV infection.,"HIV infection has been associated with progressive deterioration of the immune system and the development of opportunistic infections and various malignancies.

A type of cervical malignancy that takes a very aggressive course is being increasingly reported. Other lower genital tract tumors such as vaginal and vulvar neoplasia are also more prevalent in HIV-positive women and a closer follow-up is probably indicated in these patient population. Gestational trophoblastic disease in AIDS patients has also been reported to be more resistant to chemotherapy and may have a grave prognosis. Finally, nongynecological malignancies such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) may have their first site of appearance in the genital organs, thus simulating gynecological tumors.

Colposcopy and HPV tests with hybrid capture 2 and polymerase chain reaction-reverse line blot were performed. The prevalences of HPV in ASCUS/AGUS-negative histology, ASCUS/AGUS, LSIL, HSIL, and invasive cancer were 33.8%, 38.3%, 74.9%, 84.3% and 100%, respectively, with an overall positive rate of 68.8%. The most common HPV types were HPV 16 (18.5%), 52 (16.5%), 58 (13.2%), 33, 51, 53, 18, 39, 59, 66, MM8, and 31. In comparing the relative risk of HPV infection in different disease status, LSIL and HSIL/carcinoma had a 4.64 (95% CI: 2.98-7.24) and 10.53 (95% CI: 6.69-16.58) folds of risk of high-risk HPV infection than the negative group. The same was true in mixed HPV infection, but not in low-risk type infection. Looking into each high-risk HPV type, the relative infection risks for LSIL and HSIL/carcinoma, in comparison with the negative group, were 1.67 (0.63-4.43) and 8.67 (3.46-21.70), 2017 (1.01-4.68) and 3.04 (1.42-6.47), and 1.40 (0.52-3.77) and 5.22 (2.07-13.19) for HPV type 16, 52 and 58, respectively.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty-seven previously untreated patients (41 with oropharynx primaries; 33 men, 14 women; median age, 53 years; performance status of 0 or 1) with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN; T1-4, N2b/c/3) were treated and evaluated for clinical and radiographic response. After ICT, patients underwent risk-based local therapy, which consisted of either radiation, concomitant chemoradiotherapy, or surgery, based on tumor stage and site at diagnosis. Results After induction PCC, nine patients (19%) achieved a complete response, and 36 patients (77%) achieved a partial response. The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity was skin rash (45%), followed by neutropenia (21%) without fever. At a median follow-up time of 33 months, locoregional or systemic disease progression was observed in six patients. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 87% (95% CI, 78% to 97%) and 91% (95% CI, 84% to 99%), respectively. Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16, found in 12 (46%) of 26 biopsies, was associated with improved PFS (P = .012) and OS (P = .046). CONCLUSION ICT with weekly PCC followed by risk-based local therapy seems to be feasible, effective, and well tolerated. PFS is promising, and this sequential treatment strategy should be further investigated. Patients with HPV-positive tumors have an excellent prognosis."

We received 3,300 vials of quadrivalent human papilloma virus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant vaccine (Gardasil; Merck and Co.) as a gift from the Australian Cervical Cancer Foundation (ACCF) which has a mission to provide life-saving HPV cervical cancer vaccines for women in developing countries, who cannot otherwise afford vaccination. HPV vaccine was offered to 1,096 of 10 to 26 year aged girls attending 17 secondary schools. In total, 1,091 (99.5%) received the second dose and 1,089 (99.3%) received the third dose of the vaccine. The remaining 5 girls at second dose and 2 girls at third dose remained unvaccinated. No serious vaccine related adverse events were reported except mild pain at the injection site in 7.8% of the vaccine recipients. High cost and low public awareness are the key barriers for successful implementation of the vaccination program in resource limited developing countries. In conclusion, HPV vaccine is safe with high acceptability in Nepalese school girls. However a large population study for longer follow up is warranted to validate the findings of this vaccination program."

CD008054,0,16003735,0,Screening for cervical cancer in India: How much will it cost? A trial based analysis of the cost per case detected.,"The cost and cost effectiveness of screening previously unscreened women by VIA, cytology or HPV testing was investigated within a large cluster randomised trial involving 131,178 women in rural India. All resources involved in implementation, training, management, recruitment, screening and diagnosis were identified and costed. We estimated the total costs and detection rates for each cluster and used these data to calculate an average cluster cost and detection rate for each screening approach. These estimates were combined to estimate a cost per case of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 or invasive cancer (CIN 2/3+) detected. The average total costs per 1,000 women eligible for screening were US dollar 3,917, US dollar 6,609 and US dollar 11,779 with VIA, cytology and HPV respectively. The cost of detecting a case of CIN2/3+ using VIA was dollar 522 (95% CI dollar 429- dollar 652). Our results suggest that more CIN2/3+ cases would be detected in the same population if cytology were used instead of VIA and each additional case would cost US dollar 1065 (95% CI dollar 713- dollar2175). Delivering cervical cancer screening is potentially expensive in a low-income country although costs might be lower outside a trial setting. We found screening with VIA to be the least expensive option, but it also detected fewer cases of CIN2/3+ than other methods; its long-term cost-effectiveness will depend on the long-term benefits of early detection. Cytology was more effective at detecting cases than VIA but was also more expensive. Our findings indicate that HPV may not be a cost effective screening strategy in India at current consumable prices."
CD008054,0,10204101,0,Biological behavior and etiology of inflammatory cervical smears.,"Two hundred and fifty-seven consecutive women attending a major maternal and child health (MCH) center were studied clinically, colposcopically, cytologically, and microbiologically for different gynecologic infections. Out of 257 cases, 207 (80.5%) had inflammatory cervical smears, of which 183 (88.4%) were infected with one or more genital tract infections. Bacterial vaginosis (risk, 22.6-fold), chlamydia (risk, 21.6-fold), and human papillomavirus (HPV) (risk, 13.5-fold) were independently associated with inflammatory smears. In addition, significantly higher proportions of women with inflammatory smears had cervical ectopies (28.5% vs. 10.2%) and bleeding ectopies (30.9% vs. 4.1%) as compared to noninflammatory smears. Women infected with bacterial/parasitic genital infections were given specific treatment. These women were followed up at regular intervals to assess the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. During follow-up examination, only 26 women (12.6%) showed negative smears. Sixteen women developed squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) during follow-up, and 163 women had persistent inflammatory smears. Multivariate analysis revealed that persistent inflammatory smears were associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, as revealed through detection of IgA antibodies to HSV (risk, 11.5-fold). Progression of SIL was associated with HPV infection (risk, 17.6 fold). Thus, inflammatory smears are associated with different types of infection, most of which do not respond to antimicrobial therapy."
CD008054,0,15608417,0,Function and importance of p63 in normal oral mucosa and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is the 6th most common malignancy worldwide with a 5-year survival that has not improved over the last 20-25 years. Factors of prognostic significance for this tumour type include the presence of regional lymph node metastasis and amplification of chromosome 3q21-29, where the p63 gene is located. This gene encodes 6 proteins and is crucial for formation of the oral mucosa, teeth, salivary glands and skin. Each of the 6 different p63 proteins has different characteristics and functions, where some resemble the tumour suppressor protein p53, whilst others have functions that oppose p53."
CD008054,0,7744116,0,"Diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of H.P.V.-C.I.N.","Between April 1989 and December 1993, eight thousand one hundred women under cytologic suspect of human papillomavirus (HPV) cervical infection underwent new cytology, colposcopy, colposcopically directed exocervical biopsy, and, eventually, endocervical curettage. HPV cervical lesions were confirmed in 300 patients (3.7%), on the basis of at least, two positive diagnostic methods. Prior to surgery, the Papanicolaou smear was negative in 50 women, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I in 170 cases, CIN II in 70, and CIN III in the other 10 patients. Cryosurgery was practised in CIN I, II, or III and clinical condylomata (a total of 200 patients: 66.6%). Following cryosurgery, patients were seen six weeks and one year after for repeating cytology, colposcopy and cervical biopsy (if necessary). One-year-later cytology was negative in 230 cases (76.7%); 60 (20%) of CIN I; 7 (2.3%) of CIN II; and only one case of CIN III. At the same moment, colposcopy was normal in 66.6% of these patients. The incidence of cervical HPV (3.7%) is higher than the one referred by other authors, because of the use of endocervical curettage. We conclude the cryosurgery is quite a good therapeutic method in HPV cervical lesions."

CD008054,0,15258976,0,Detection of high-risk human papillomavirus E6 and E7 oncogene transcripts in cervical scrapes by nested RT-polymerase chain reaction.,"The oncogenic potential of the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes (types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68) depends on the expression of the two viral oncogenes E6 and E7. Thus, the detection of HPV E6/E7 oncogene transcripts could serve as a factor in the evaluation of a risk of development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and its progression to cervical cancer. A nested RT-PCR assay for the detection of E6/E7 oncogene transcripts of all known high-risk HPV genotypes was established. In the study described, 779 high-risk HPV-DNA-positive cervical scrapes exhibiting all grades of CIN, including non-dysplastic cervical mucosa (CIN 0), were examined. Spliced E6/E7 oncogene transcripts of all the high-risk HPVs were detected in numerous samples, with an overall detection rate of 47%. In 227 cases with agreement between the cytologic and histologic findings, the prevalence increased with lesion severity: CIN 0, 18%; CIN I, 58%; CIN II, 77%; CIN III, 84%. Multiple transcriptionally active high-risk HPVs were detected in 12% (33/279) of patients with multiple high-risk HPV infections. This work sets the stage for a prospective follow-up study currently being undertaken to evaluate the prognostic relevance of the detection of high-risk HPV E6/E7 oncogene transcripts for the persistence of a high risk HPV infection, and the possible evolution and further development of a CIN. Future applications of the assay described may include the monitoring of women in studies investigating antiviral treatment or vaccination."

CD008054,0,12467785,0,Clinical utility of molecular detection of human papillomavirus in cervical samples by hybrid capture technology.,"High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the primary risk factor for developing cervical carcinoma. Hybrid capture II HPV Test (HCII) is a standardized test for molecular detection of HPV DNA in cervical swabs. The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical utility of the HCII when used in combination with conventional cytology in a group of 171 women who were followed-up with both, cytology and molecular testing for 3 years. At the end of the study, only women positive for high-risk HPV at baseline had retained or worsened cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). In most women who were negative for high-risk HPV, CIN had resolved within 3 years. These results are in concordance with earlier studies reporting the highly negative predictive value of high-risk HPV testing. Both cytology and high-risk HPV testing provide significant clinical information on the current cervical status of a woman. They should be used in combination for primary screening of CIN, which will provide a more selective and cost-effective follow-up."

CD008054,0,12743139,0,Cervical cancer screening: from the Papanicolaou smear to the vaccine era.,"In the next 20 years, cervical cancer screening will have evolved through four phases. The first was traditional screening, which has been associated with a two-thirds reduction in cancer incidence and death rates in the last 50 years and currently is ending. We are entering a second phase, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, for managing cytologic abnormalities and possibly for primary screening. A third phase, new in development, proposes the use of host biomarkers (or combinations thereof) as either surrogates of HPV infection or, potentially, indicators to assess cancer risk and concentrate available resources on a subset of women. The fourth and, likely, final phase will be screening in an era of vaccines. If HPV vaccines are successful, the pool of at-risk individuals and the prevalence of papillomaviruses that place them at risk will gradually shrink. In this climate, screening strategies that target HPVs alone (as opposed to cytologic testing) may become more economical. If so, previous strategies may become obsolete as the balance of cervical cancer prevention shifts from traditional screening to primary prevention coupled with HPV testing."
CD008054,0,18232005,0,Effectiveness of the ThinPrep Imaging System: clinical experience in a low risk screening population.,"The Cytyc ThinPrep Imaging System was FDA approved based on a multi-institutional clinical trial, in which the HSIL+ prevalence rate was 0.7%. This study determines the effectiveness of the Imager in clinical practice at an academic medical center with a historical HSIL+ rate of 0.25%. Cytological interpretations were compared for two 12-month periods pre- and post-Imager implementation. Data was compiled by cytologic diagnoses, and variations in prevalence rates were analyzed for statistical significance. Interpretations of ASC-US, ASC-H, and LSIL were correlated with Digene Hybrid Capture2 High Risk HPV DNA testing; interpretations of ASC-H, LSIL, and HSIL+ were correlated with subsequent surgical follow-up. ASC-US, ASC-H, and LSIL detection rates increased 34, 48, and 29%, respectively, with the Imager (P<0.001); whereas the detection of HSIL increased 24% (P<0.051). Surgical correlation revealed no statistical differences in the positive predictive value (PPV) for ASC-H and LSIL. However, an increase in the PPV of HSIL was found (P<0.05). High risk HPV results were lower for ASC-US (P<0.001), but statistically equivalent for ASC-H and LSIL. Results of surgical correlation and HPV testing validated an increase in detection rates of ASC-H, LSIL, and HSIL, as well as increased PPV of HSIL with the ThinPrep Imaging System."
CD008054,0,15292929,0,Determinants of human papillomavirus 16 serological conversion and persistence in a population-based cohort of 10 000 women in Costa Rica.,"Determinants of human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 serological conversion and persistence were assessed in a population-based cohort of 10 049 women in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Serologic responses to HPV-16 were measured in 7986 women by VLP-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at both study enrollment (1993/94) and at 5-7 years of follow-up. Seropositive women were defined as >/=5 standard deviations above the mean optical density obtained for studied virgins at enrollment (n=573). Seroconnversion (n=409), persistence (n=675), and clearance (n=541) were defined based on enrollment and follow-up serology measurements. Age-specific distributions revealed that HPV-16 seroconversion was highest among 18- to 24-year-old women, steadily declining with age; HPV-16 seropersistence was lowest in women 65+ years. In age-adjusted multivariate logistic regression models, a 10-fold risk increase for HPV-16 seroconversion was associated with HPV-16 DNA detection at enrollment and follow-up; two-fold risk of seroconversion to HPV-16 was associated with increased numbers of lifetime and recent sexual partners and smoking status. Determinants of HPV-16 seropersistence included a 1.5-fold risk increase associated with having one sexual partner during follow-up, former oral contraceptive use, and a 3-fold risk increase associated with HPV-16 DNA detection at both enrollment and follow-up. Higher HPV-16 viral load at enrollment was associated with seroconversion, and higher antibody titres at enrollment were associated with seropersistence."

We compared p16(INK4A) immunocytochemical staining and Hybrid Capture 2 (HCII) on SurePath specimens using tissue biopsies (as the gold standard). Their utility in a spectrum of atypical and preneoplastic lesions, and their ability to accurately identify underlying lesions of CIN II or greater was assessed using biopsy follow-up data. One-hundred and seventeen residual SurePath samples were collected: 43 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 47 low-grade (LGSIL), and 27 high-grade (HGSIL) squamous intraepithelial lesions. Two slides were prepared from each sample; one stained with the SurePath autocyte stain and one immunostained using the CINtec p16(INK4a) Cytology Kit (Dakocytomation). High-risk HPV testing was performed using the HCII DNA test (Digene, Gaithersburg, MD). Available tissue biopsy follow-up data was retrieved. p16(INK4a) was positive in 32.6% (14/43) ASCUS, 46.8% (22/47) LGSIL, and 48.1% (13/27) HGSIL specimens. HCII DNA test was positive in 41.9% (18/43) ASCUS, 78.7% (37/47) LGSIL, and 96.3% (26/27) HGSIL samples. The sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values of p16(INK4a) and HCII were: 58.7% and 89.8%, 58.6% and 34.6%, 69.2% and 72.1%, 47.2% and 64.3%, respectively. In patients with cervical biopsies, the PPV of HCII (92.3%) results for a biopsy with CINII/III was significantly higher than the PPV of p16(INK4a) (52%) (P=0.001). Using liquid-based cytology specimens, HCII is a more sensitive test than p16(INK4a) for detection of abnormal cytology. HCII has a higher PPV than p16(INK4a) for identifying CIN II/III."

CD008054,0,15891259,0,Case study: periodic follow-up is necessary in morphea profunda to identify systemic evolution.,"The term ""morphea"" includes a wide spectrum of clinical entities, varying from localized plaques of only cosmetic importance to deep lesions resulting in considerable morbidity for the patient. In fact, although survival rates are no different from that of the general population, localized scleroderma may be associated with development of substantial disability, as occurs in deep morphea and in pediatric patients (disabling pansclerotic morphea of children). We report a case of morphea profunda affecting a young man with severe, rapidly progressive, widespread skin involvement and focus on the eventual systemic evolution of such cases. A 40-year-old man was admitted in 2002 for progressive subcutaneous indurations, preferentially involving the right side of the trunk. His health was altogether good, with the exception of a beginning chronic obstructive bronchopneumopathy. There was no family or personal history of dysmetabolic, cardiovascular, neoplastic, or cutaneous disease. Three years earlier, the patient had noted the appearance of two infiltrated, intensely red lesions on the right laterocervical and paraumbilical regions. These had been interpreted as subcutaneous lipomatosis on the basis of an ultrasound scan. The lesions had become progressively larger, while their surface had assumed a scleroatrophic appearance. Thereafter, other lesions had developed on his chest and lower limbs, mostly distributed on the right side of the body. Clinical examination revealed well demarcated, depressed sclerotic plaques with ivory-colored centers and erythematous borders (""lilac ring"") localized on the neck, chest, and lower abdomen and limbs (Figure 1). They were bound to the deeper structures and arranged in a band-like linear distribution on the right side of the chest and abdomen where they extended horizontally for more than 10 cm in diameter. These lesions were totally asymptomatic. In addition, arborizing telangiectasias were evident on the neck and upper chest (Figure 2). Laboratory investigations provided normal range of erythrocyte sedimentation rat and C reactive protein levels and other inflammation markers. Antinuclear antibody, antidouble-strand DNA, antimitochondrial, anti-extractable antigens (anti-centromere, anti-Scl-70, anti-U1RNP), and anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies were negative. Circulating immunocomplexes binding C1q were substantially increased. Oesophageal x-rays and lower limb electromyography were within normal limits; ventilatory function testing revealed a mild obstruction consistent with the beginning of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although nailfold capillaroscopy documented nonspecific findings of connective tissue disease (mega-capillaries, segmentary dilatation and destruction), the laser-Doppler flussimetry revealed few signs of microcirculatory abnormalities, in absence of Raynaud's phenomenon. An abdominal wall ultrasonography, performed on a sclerotic plaque, documented thinning of the subcutaneous tissue, with increase of the fibrous component and lower fascia and muscle retraction. The biopsy specimen from the abdominal region included fascia and the subcutaneous tissue (previously obtained from the lower abdomen) with epidermal atrophy, a thickening and homogenization of collagen bundles in the deep dermis and hair reduction. A perivascular lympho-monocytic and plasmacellular infiltration with a dermo-epidermal distribution was present. Moreover, septal fibrosis with a perivascular lymphoplasmacellular inflammatory infiltrate was documented within the abdominal rectus muscle. The diagnosis of morphea profunda was made on the basis of clinical and histopathological findings. A therapeutic regimen based on amino benzoic potassium (Potaba; Glenwood, LLC, Glenwood, NJ), oral prednisone, and topical clobetasol was started. After several months of follow-up, the patient had obtained only moderate improvement of the clinical findings."

In contrast, 28% of women with cervical smears showing mild dyskaryosis had high-grade CIN. The presence of koilocytosis (24% for borderline smears and 34% for mild dyskaryotic smears) did not appear to influence the risk of developing high-grade CIN.

As several years have elapsed since these guidelines attained some measure of widespread implementation, we sought to determine whether, in routinely diagnosed cases, the full spectrum of follow-up cytological findings are indeed identical in these 2 groups. Clinical and pathological data of consecutive patients with a Pap test interpretation of ASC-US during a 6-week period (n = 587), in which reflex human papillomavirus testing was performed (n = 497) and in which HR HPV types were not detected (n = 300), were reviewed (study group). A randomly selected control group of 300 patients whose Pap tests were reported as negative (negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy) during the same period were similarly reviewed. The follow-up Pap tests were classified into the various Bethesda 2001 diagnostic categories, and both groups were compared. The average follow-up duration in the study and control groups was 26.03 and 25.9 months, respectively. When all of the follow-up Pap tests in each group (study, n = 555; control, n = 356) were used for the comparisons, patients in the study group were significantly more likely to have an abnormal follow-up Pap test result than the control group patients (24.9% vs 7.6%, P < 0.0001); this was primarily attributable to the more frequent repeat interpretations of ASC-US in the former group (20.5% vs 5.1%, P < 0.0001). The HR HPV detection rates in the follow-up ASC-US cases were not significantly different between the study and control groups. There were no significant differences between both groups regarding the diagnostic frequencies of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL). No examples of HGSIL or invasive cancer were identified in the follow-up of either group. All comparisons of statistical significance retained their significance when only 1 follow-up Pap test per patient, the most severe interpretation, was used. Our findings suggest that some significant differences exist between these 2 groups, most notably the comparatively increased frequency of repeat ASC-US interpretations in the study group. However, the extraordinary rarity of the most clinically significant interpretations of HGSIL and carcinoma in this setting can be confirmed because no such cases were identified during the follow-up of either group."

CD008054,0,8604805,0,Myxofibrosarcoma. Clinicopathologic analysis of 75 cases with emphasis on the low-grade variant.,"Myxofibrosarcoma is one of the most common sarcomas in the extremities of elderly patients. We analysed the clinicopathologic features in a series of 75 patients. All patients were adults (range, 22-91 years; median, 66 years) with an approximately equal incidence in men and women. Thirty-five tumors arose in the lower and 25 in the upper extremities, nine on the trunk, two each in the retroperitoneum and the head and neck region, and one each in the pelvis and penis. Forty-eight cases (69.5%) were located in dermal or subcutaneous tissues. Distinctive histologic features included the following: a commonly nodular growth pattern; a myxoid matrix containing elongated, curvilinear capillaries; and fusiform, round or stellate tumor cells with indistinct cell margins, slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, and hyperchromatic atypical nuclei. These lesions varied from a hypocellular, mainly myxoid, and purely spindle-cell appearance (low-grade neoplasms) to high-grade, pleomorphic (malignant fibrous histiocytoma-like) lesions with multinucleated giant cells, high mitotic activity, and areas of necrosis. Immunohistochemistry in 44 cases revealed only vimentin and occasional actin positivity. Ultrastructurally, tumor cells had a fibroblastic phenotype. DNA flow cytometry and proliferation analysis showed an association between aneuploidy and histologic grade. An average follow-up of 45 months (range, 5-300 months) in 60 cases has revealed local recurrence in 33 cases (54%). Thirteen patients developed metastases, and 13 tumor-related deaths occurred. A short interval to first local recurrence was associated with poor clinical outcome. The rate of local recurrence was independent of histologic grade, but only intermediate and high-grade neoplasms metastasized. The depth of the primary lesion did not influence the incidence of local recurrence. However, in deep-seated neoplasms, the incidence of metastases was higher and the percentage of tumor-related deaths was twice as high as in superficially located lesions, reflecting the fact that deep-seated lesions tended to be higher-grade, larger tumors. Myxofibrosarcoma tends to become progressively higher grade in recurrences, as demonstrated in five cases in our series. The poorly recognized low-grade myxofibrosarcoma is emphasized, as proper diagnosis and treatment and scrupulous follow-up are mandatory to avoid local recurrence and gradual tumor progression to a higher-grade neoplasm that may then metastasize."

CD008054,0,15199273,0,HPV testing and monitoring of women after treatment of CIN 3: review of the literature and meta-analysis.,"According to the current guidelines in most western countries, women treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3) are followed for at least 2 years after treatment by cytology.High-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infections are necessary for the development and maintenance of CIN 3. HrHPV testing could be used to improve monitoring of women treated for CIN 3. This has prompted numerous studies for the implementation of hrHPV testing in monitoring of women treated for CIN 3. Included in this review are 20 studies, published between 1996 and 2003, comparing hrHPV testing with either resection margins or cervical cytology to predict recurrent/residual disease, and 11 of them could be used in a meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis of the 11 studies, the negative predictive value (NPV) for recurrent/residual disease of hrHPV testing was 98% (95% CI 97-99%), that of resection margins 91% (95% CI 87-94%), and that of cervical cytology 93% (95% CI 90-95%). When hrHPV testing was performed in conjunction with cytology, the sensitivity was 96% (95% CI 89-99%), specificity was 81% (95% CI 77-84%), the associated positive predictive value (PPV) was 46% (95% CI 38-54%), and the NPV was 99% (95% CI 98-100%). Combined hrHPV and cytology testing yielded the best test characteristics. We propose to include hrHPV testing in conjunction with cytology for monitoring women treated for CIN 3. Some follow-up visits for women testing negative for both hrHPV and cytology can be skipped. In western countries, this could mean that for women double negative at 6 months, retesting at 12 months should be skipped while keeping the 24-month follow-up visit."
CD008054,0,18847555,0,Overview of human papillomavirus-based and other novel options for cervical cancer screening in developed and developing countries.,"Screening for cervical cancer precursors by cytology has been very successful in countries where adequate resources exist to ensure high quality and good coverage of the population at risk. Mortality reductions in excess of 50% have been achieved in many developed countries; however the procedure is generally inefficient and unworkable in many parts of the world where the appropriate infrastructure is not achievable. A summary and update of recently published meta-analyses and systematic reviews on four possible clinical applications of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing is provided in this article: (1) triage of women with equivocal or low-grade cytological abnormalities; (2) follow-up of women with abnormal screening results who are negative at colposcopy/biopsy; (3) prediction of the therapeutic outcome after treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and most importantly (4) primary screening HPV DNA test, solely or in combination with Pap smear to detect cervical cancer precursors. There are clear benefits for the use of HPV DNA testing in the triage of equivocal smears, low-grade smears in older women and in the post-treatment surveillance of women after treatment for CIN. However, there are still issues regarding how best to use HPV DNA testing in primary screening. Primary screening with Hybrid Capture((R)) 2 (HC2) generally detects more than 90% of all CIN2, CIN3 or cancer cases, and is 25% (95% CI): 15-36%) relatively more sensitive than cytology at a cut-off of abnormal squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) (or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) if ASC-US unavailable), but is 6% (95% CI: 4-7%) relatively less specific. Several approaches are currently under evaluation to deal with the lower specificity of HPV DNA testing as associated with transient infection. These include HPV typing for HPV-16 and -18/45, markers of proliferative lesions such as p16 and mRNA coding for the viral E6 and/or E7 proteins, with a potential clinical use recommending more aggressive management in those who are positive. In countries where cytology is of good quality, the most attractive option for primary screening is to use HPV DNA testing as the sole screening modality with cytology reserved for triage of HPV-positive women. Established cytology-based programmes should also be gradually moving towards a greater use of HPV DNA testing to improve their efficacy and safely lengthen the screening interval. The greater sensitivity of HPV DNA testing compared to cytology argues strongly for using HPV DNA testing as the primary screening test in newly implemented programmes, except where resources are extremely limited and only programmes based on visual inspection are affordable. In such countries, use of a simple HPV DNA test followed by immediate 'screen and treat' algorithms based on visual inspection in those who are HPV-positive are needed to minimise the number of visits and make best use of limited resources. A review of studies for visual inspection methods is presented. The fact that HPV is a sexually transmitted infection may lead to anxiety and concerns about sexual relationships. These psychosocial aspects and the need for more information and educational programmes about HPV are also discussed in this article."
CD008054,0,19853189,0,Innovation in cervical cancer prevention and control in Mexico.,"Disparities related to cervical cancer continue to exist in Mexico, including insufficient screening coverage, problems with quality control and a resulting greater risk of mortality among women from marginalized areas. A lack of opportunities and requirements for continuing education and accreditation of healthcare personnel involved in the screening program is also an issue. HPV DNA testing and HPV vaccines are recent technological innovations that offer a potential solution to the continued negative impact of cervical cancer among Mexican women. This essay attempts to answer questions such as: Why should HPV testing be integrated into the early detection program in Mexico? How can HPV testing best be integrated into the program in Mexico? How-from a public health perspective that seeks to reduce disparities-can HPV vaccination best be implemented in Mexico? HPV testing allows increased positive predictive value while also reducing costly and unnecessary overtreatment of low-grade abnormalities, and HPV vaccines offer the possibility of primary prevention of cervical cancer. The strategy proposed for Mexico includes primary prevention with HPV vaccination for girls aged between 12 and 16 years (before sexual initiation), Pap testing with excellent quality control for women 24-34 years of age and high-risk HPV DNA testing for women 35 years and older. HPV samples would be either clinically collected or self-collected and women with positive HPV test results would receive follow-up high-quality Pap testing. This approach is creative and focuses on reducing disparities and providing high-quality care that is also cost effective."
CD008054,0,19853188,0,The expected impact of HPV vaccination on the accuracy of cervical cancer screening: the need for a paradigm change.,"We used modeling approaches to estimate the impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on the performance of Pap cytology screening under different assumptions of lesion prevalence and expected changes in sensitivity and specificity likely to prevail post-vaccination. A major driver of the efficiency and costs of screening, the positive predictive value will be severely affected if Pap cytology continues to serve as the primary screening test in the post-vaccination era. Molecular-based screening with an HPV DNA test followed by Pap triage of HPV-positive cases has the potential for circumventing this problem. As a primary screening test, HPV testing can improve the overall quality of screening programs, thus allowing for increased testing intervals that would lower program costs with acceptable safety. Cytology should be reserved for the more labor-efficient task of triaging HPV-positive cases, a situation in which case loads would be ""enriched"" with smears containing relevant abnormalities. HPV followed by Pap strategy can also serve a secondary role in post-vaccination surveillance."

A newly developed HPV vaccine can provide protection against both cervical cancer and genital warts. This vaccine could be promoted by health authorities/professionals as preventing cervical cancer plus genital warts, or cervical cancer alone. Because stigma around STIs may reduce acceptance of the vaccine, the effect of information framing ('cervical cancer' versus 'cervical cancer plus genital warts') on intention to receive the HPV vaccine and actual uptake behavior was examined using the health belief model (HBM)."
CD008054,0,10899654,0,Variants of the long control region of human papillomavirus type 16.,"Expression of the human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncogenes is regulated on the transcriptional level by specific protein-binding sites contained in the viral long control region (LCR). Sequence changes within the LCR region may have an impact on the transcription of viral oncogenes, possibly resulting in differences in the oncogenic potential of the virus. The present study was designed to determine the sequence variability of the LCR of HPV 16 and to assess whether certain LCR variants do correlate with the clinical outcome of the disease of the uterine cervix. The entire LCR segment of HPV 16 was analysed from 37 cervical biopsy specimens derived from 28 women included in the Kuopio long-term prospective follow-up study. The LCR sequence was identical with the reference sequence in six HPV 16 isolates. Overall, 14 different HPV 16 LCR variants were identified. One of the variants showed sequence variation typical of the Asian-American variant lineage of HPV 16, and all the other variants appeared to belong to the European variant group. The European variants exhibited low genetic diversity, and only five of these LCR variants contained nucleotide changes involving known or proposed binding sites for transcription factors. The variants with changes at nucleotide positions 7193 and 7521 was the most prevalent, accounting for almost 37% of infections. This variant (7193; 7521) has been previously demonstrated to have similar transcriptional activity compared with the reference isolate by Veress and colleagues J Gen Virol 1999, 80, 1035-1043. The reference isolate, variant (7193; 7521) and variants with changes within transcription factor binding sites accounted for most of the infections, and no significant differences were found in the comparison of the distribution of these different LCR isolates in cases where the disease showed progression to severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or carcinoma in situ (CIS). Notably, both the reference isolate and variant (7193; 7521) were also closely associated with infections showing more aggressive behaviour. According to the present findings, in European HPV 16 isolates, intratype genetic variation of the LCR region does not seem to be commonly responsible for differences in the pathogenicity of the virus and thereby for a risk of progressive infections."
CD008054,0,16835322,1,Human papillomavirus type-specific 18-month risk of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in women with a normal or borderline/mildly dyskaryotic smear.,High-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) DNA testing is an increasingly used instrument in cervical cancer prevention along cervical cytology.

CD008054,0,19853185,0,The role of retinoid deficiency and estrogens as cofactors in cervical cancer.,"Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) is involved in cervical cancer (CC), a major cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Infection occurs primarily at the transformation zone (TZ), the most estrogen- and retinoid-sensitive region of the cervix. Development of CC affects a small percentage of HR-HPV-infected women and often takes decades after infection, suggesting that HR-HPV is a necessary but not sufficient cause of CC. Thus, other cofactors are necessary for progression from cervical HR-HPV infection to cancer such as long-term use of hormonal contraceptives, multiparity, smoking, as well as micronutrient depletion and in particular retinoid deficiency, which alters epithelial differentiation, cellular growth and apoptosis of malignant cells. Therefore, early detection of HR-HPV and management of precancerous lesions together with a profound understanding of additional risk factors could be a strategy to avoid this disease. In this review we focus on the synergic effect of estrogens, retinoid deficiency and HR-HPVs in the development of CC. These risk factors may act in concert to induce neoplastic transformation in squamous epithelium of the cervix, setting the stage for secondary genetic or epigenetic events leading to cervical cancer."

CD008054,0,7622999,0,Correlation of human papillomavirus 16 and 18 with prognostic factors in invasive cervical neoplasias.,"Forty-seven patients with cervical carcinoma were examined in order to correlate human papillomavirus (HPV) types with prognostic factors in invasive cervical neoplasias. Age, clinical stage, histological type, and grade and parity were analysed with respect to HPV status as determined by a general primer mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or a type specific PCR. All but one sample (98%) harboured HPV sequences: HPV 16 was found in 26 cases (55%), HPV 18 in 19 cases (40%), and HPV 31 in 1 case. The presence of HPV 18 DNA was significantly associated with cancers developed below 40 years of age (P = 0.029). HPV 18 detection was associated with poor differentiation malignancy (P = 0.045) and histological types of poor prognosis (adenocarcinoma or nondifferentiated carcinoma; P = 0.006). HPV 18 positivity was also correlated with advanced clinical stages (FIGO II and III; P = 0.032). Parity and HPV status proved to be independent of each other (P approximately 0.99). Eighty-seven percent (27/31) of pelvic lymph nodes from HPV positive patients contained HPV DNA. The virus types found in lymph nodes were identical with those of the primary tumours in all cases. Virological results were compared to those obtained by routine histological examination. Only 6 of 27 patients with HPV positive lymph nodes had any histological evidence of metastasis. Nevertheless, the lack of metastasis as detected by histology does not exclude the possibility of relapses.

CD008054,0,9316345,0,Schneiderian papilloma.,"Schneiderian papillomas are benign neoplasms that are associated with three key characteristics: tendency to recur, capacity for local destruction, and association with squamous cell carcinoma. They are classified into inverting, fungiform, and oncocytic varieties. The inverting and fungiform varieties are the most common, and the inverting variety has the highest rate of association with malignancy. The inverting and oncocytic varieties are classically found on the lateral nasal wall with extension into the adjacent sinuses. The fungiform lesion is typically found on the nasal septum. Treatment of these lesions is primarily surgical, with rather aggressive surgery mandated in most cases. There may be a limited role for radiation therapy and close follow-up of these patients is mandatory. These neoplasms arise from a unique area of the respiratory epithelium, termed the schneiderian mucosa. Although these are relatively rare lesions, their association with carcinoma and their tendency to be confused with more common lesions make this topic important for all practitioners."

CD008054,0,17938016,0,Long-term efficacy of human papillomavirus vaccination.,"Achieving long-term protection following vaccination is crucial to ensuring that high levels of immunity are maintained within a population while eliminating the need to introduce booster vaccinations. Based on an analysis of the hepatitis B virus vaccine, several factors have been shown to contribute to long-term protection, namely: specific lymphoproliferation, the in vivo humoral response, and immune memory. To ensure protection against persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the subsequent development of cervical lesions, an effective HPV vaccine must be able to induce strong humoral immune responses. Mathematical modeling analyses based on a three-dose regimen of HPV type 16 prophylactic vaccine indicated that 99% of 16- to 23-year-old women would have almost life-long detectable anti-HPV-16 levels. Available data on the quadrivalent HPV vaccine demonstrated that long-term immune memory was induced, with anti-HPV geometric mean titers after 5 years remaining at or above those observed with natural infection. Vaccination also resulted in a substantial reduction in the combined incidence of HPV-6/11/16/18 related persistent infection or disease, and there were no cases of precancerous cervical dysplasia compared with six cases in women receiving placebo. Similarly the bivalent HPV vaccine has been shown to induce long-term immunity with >98% seropositivity maintained after 4.5 years of follow-up and geometric mean titres at this time point remaining substantially higher than those noted with naturally acquired infection. Countrywide registration regarding population and health events in a stable population of approximately 25 million makes the Nordic countries an ideal setting for the evaluation of long-term cervical cancer control. Population-based long-term efficacy trials conducted in these countries aim to investigate the long-term efficacy of HPV vaccination with regard to invasive cervical cancer, and the results of these trials are awaited with interest."
CD008054,0,17938012,0,Screening and management of women and girls with human papillomavirus infection.,"In the US, reductions in cervical cancer-related mortality over the past five decades can be attributed to the implementation of screening programs. US-based guidelines recommend that screening should be initiated approximately 3 years after initiation of sexual intercourse, but no later than age 21 years and be continued at least until age 65 or 70. Annual screening is recommended by the American Cancer Society and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, although in women aged > or =30 years with > or =3 negative Pap tests, screening may be conducted every 2 to 3 years. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and most US guidelines say that it is reasonable to consider HPV testing, in combination with triennial cytology screening. Pharmacoeconomic analyses indicate that combined cytology and HPV testing every three years in women aged > or =30 years is comparable in sensitivity to annual liquid-based cytology for the detection of cervical cancer precursors and is more cost-effective. Both surgical and nonsurgical therapies are commonly employed in patients with HPV lesions although papilloma recurrence is not uncommon. Treatment should be individualized based on the extent of disease and the needs of the patient. Current treatment of cervical cancer reflects the stage of the disease and should take into account patient- and tumor-related factors to ensure optimal patient outcomes."

Polymorphisms in XPC gene have been analyzed in case-control studies to assess the cancer risk attributed to these variants, but results are conflicting. To clarify the impact of XPC polymorphisms in cancer risk, we performed a meta-analysis that included 33 published case-control studies. Polymorphisms analyzed were Lys939Gln and Ala499Val. The overall summary odds ratio (OR) for the associations of the 939Gln/Gln genotype with risk of cancer was 1.01 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.94-1.09), but there were statistically significant associations for lung cancer, observed for the recessive genetic model (Lys/Lys+Lys/Gln vs Gln/Gln), (OR 1.30; 95% CI: 1.113-1.53), whereas for breast cancer a reduced but nonsignificant risk was observed for the same model (OR 0.87; 95% CI: 0.74-1.01). The results for Ala499Val showed a significant overall increase in cancer risk (OR 1.15; 95% CI: 1.02-1.31), and for bladder cancer in both the simple genetic model (Ala/Ala vs Val/Val) (OR 1.30; 95% CI: 1.04-1.61) and the recessive genetic model (Ala/Ala+Ala/Val vs Val/Val) (OR 1.32; 95% CI: 1.06-1.63).

Rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain DNA has been found in the plasma of patients with non-Hodgkins lymphoma and acute B cell leukaemia. Microsatellite instability, expressed either as a new allele or a loss of one allele (LOH) occurs in the plasma and serum DNA of patients suffering from head and neck, lung and renal cell cancer.

CD008054,0,11240666,0,The use of human papillomavirus typing in detection of cervical neoplasia in Recife (Brazil).,"High risk types of human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) play a major role in cervical cancer oncogenesis. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of HPV detection and typing as a means of identifying cervical neoplasia in a high risk population. A management algorithm for implementation of HPV detection in clinical practice is also proposed. A nested case-control within a cohort study was undertaken in Recife (Brazil). All 479 participants had cervical scrapes collected for HPV detection followed by colposcopy. Samples were blindly analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and typed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). HPV detection by PCR and typing with RFLP cost US$ 4.92 per woman screened in this study and is significantly better than cytology in identifying women at risk of developing cervical cancer (P = 0.0001). Women who tested positive for HR-HPV had over 35-fold increased risk of having high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or cervical cancer, although this does not necessarily translate into the same risk rate for women with latent HPV infection developing major cervical neoplasia. HPV typing offers 90% sensitivity and 85% specificity for cervical cancer detection. In combination with cytology it provides a negative predictive value of 99.4% and a sensitivity of over 96% for detection of HSIL and cervical cancer. We conclude that HPV typing is an inexpensive and effective method for identification of cervical neoplasia and women at risk of developing it. It improves quality control for both false negative and false positive cytology results. Routine screening intervals could safely be increased to 3-5 years, decreasing anxiety and socio-economic inconveniences."

CD008054,0,19258937,1,The Mexican Cervical Cancer Screening Trial: self-sampling for human papillomavirus with unaided visual inspection as a secondary screen.,"The Mexican Cervical Cancer Screening (MECCS) study took place in the State of MichoacÃ¡n. Primary screening was by self-sampling for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV). The objectives were to increase the specificity of primary HPV screening by requiring 2 positive HPV tests 1 year apart in women whose secondary screen was negative according to an acetic acid-aided visual inspection (VIA). In addition, we postulated that the sensitivity of VIA would be sufficient to identify large preinvasive lesions and cancers unsuitable for cryotherapy if applied in a see-and-treat algorithm.A total of 8621 women (aged 30-50 years) were screened, and 14.3% were positive for HR-HPV. In phase 1, 11.9% of the HPV-positive women were VIA-positive and were referred for colposcopy with directed and random biopsies. If VIA-negative, women repeated the self-sample 1 year later to detect persistent HR-HPV (25.2% were positive). If persistently HR-HPV-positive in phase 2, patients again had VIA, then all women (both VIA-positive and -negative) received directed and random biopsies. If cryotherapy had been used to treat HPV- and VIA-positive women in phase 1 or persistent HR-HPV-positive (phase 2), the potential risk of undertreatment would have been 4.1%, and 66.4% of the treated patients would have had normal or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I on biopsy. The VIA triage would refer 0.73% of the patients to colposcopy owing to the lesion size, location, or the presence of a cancer. On the basis of this pilot study, we are encouraged to explore and evaluate a rapid, more sensitive, and more specific self-test."

CD008054,0,8896492,0,The natural history of human papillomavirus type 16 capsid antibodies among a cohort of university women.,"To study the temporal relationship between serum antibody response and human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) infection, a cohort of 325 university women were scheduled for examinations at 4-month intervals. At every examination, interviews were completed, cells were obtained for polymerase chain reaction-based testing and for Pap screening, and serum was obtained for testing with a HPV-16 capsid-capture ELISA. Seroreactivity was associated with detection of HPV-16 DNA and with increased numbers of sex partners. The median time to seroconversion was 8.3 months among women with incident HPV-16 infections. Within 16 months following HPV-16 DNA detection, 93.7% of women with prevalent and 67.1% of women with incident infections seroconverted. After seroconversion, antibody responses were maintained during follow-up among HPV-16 DNA-positive women. Women who seroconverted were 5.7 times (95% confidence interval = 2.4-13.4) more likely to have squamous intraepithelial lesions associated with the detection of HPV-16 DNA than were women who did not seroconvert."
CD008054,0,18820547,0,Assessing new technologies for cervical cancer screening: beyond sensitivity.,"New technologies have been proposed to replace cervical cytology as the medium for cervical cancer screening, especially testing for human papillomavirus (HPV). Many of these alternatives have been endorsed because their single-test sensitivity is superior to that of cytology. The sensitivity of a single Pap test may be as low as 50%, but lifetime testing has significantly greater sensitivity, and other parameters are also important in defining the optimal screening test. Test accuracy depends not only on sensitivity but also on specificity and disease prevalence; both of these are problematic when considering HPV as a screen. A screening test also must be acceptable to both clinicians and patients. HPV testing is regarded as test for a sexually transmitted disease by many women. Clinicians often fail to appreciate the transient nature of HPV infection, prompting overly aggressive treatment that risks future preterm birth, and there is no consensus about strategies for follow-up of abnormal HPV screening results when obtained without concomitant cytology. An emphasis on sensitivity also may be inappropriate when most cervical cancers occur in unscreened women, for whom the sensitivity of testing is irrelevant. HPV testing and other technologies have substantial promise as tests that may replace cytology in cervical cancer screening, but obstacles are significant, and premature adoption of these methods may result in patient harm."
CD008054,0,1305695,0,Strategies of chemoprevention based on antigenic and molecular markers of early and premalignant lesions of the bladder.,"Using monoclonal antibodies, we have identified a series of tumor-associated antigens selectively expressed on tumor subtypes with distinct clinical behaviours. The mucinous antigen M344 and the gp200 surface antigen 19A211 are preferentially expressed on papillary superficial tumors and carcinoma in situ lesions of the bladder. The combination of these two antigenic markers in immunocytology and flow cytometry studies of exfoliated cells has improved the sensitivity of detection for bladder tumors. Moreover, the detection of M344- and 19A211-positive exfoliated cells from previously treated but currently tumor-free patients appears to be predictive of tumor recurrence on follow-up. These results, as well as results of bladder mapping studies in tumor patients, suggest that these antigenic changes occur in a premalignant stage and may provide tools to monitor the efficacy of chemopreventive measures. Other markers, such as the surface antigen T138 and the soluble molecules autocrine motility factor (AMF) and tumor collagenase stimulating factor (TCSF), are produced by primary or recurrent tumors with a higher metastatic potential. They may be useful in identifying high risk patients for distant failure. The highly restricted antigen 19A211 is also expressed on cervix condylomas and carcinoma. This observation led us to investigate a possible viral etiology of some bladder cancers. Using PCR techniques, we detected the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 DNA sequences in a significant proportion of bladder tumors. HPV positivity was inversely correlated with the presence of p53 mutations in exons 5-9 of the same tumors as measured by PCR-SSCP technique. This combination of markers may provide a basis for chemoprevention strategies targeted to distinct etiological events."

CD008054,0,10348071,0,HPV testing in the evaluation of the minimally abnormal Papanicolaou smear.,"Minor cytologic abnormalities of the cervix, such as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), are vastly more common than high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or invasive cancer. Current guidelines for the management of ASCUS include repeating the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear at specific intervals, referring all patients for colposcopy or using an adjunctive test such as hybrid capture human papillomavirus (HPV) testing or cervicography. The usefulness of the Pap smear is limited by its considerable false-negative rate and its dependence on clinician and laboratory performance. Colposcopy is a highly sensitive procedure, but many patients with ASCUS have normal colposcopic findings. The hybrid capture test not only measures quantitative HPV load but also detects both oncogenic and nononcogenic HPV types, thereby increasing the probability that serious cervical disease is not missed. Hybrid capture sampling is simple to perform, and positive results are strongly associated with cervical dysplasia. HPV testing in women with ASCUS can be used as an adjunctive test to identify those with HPV-associated disease; it can also serve as a quality assurance measure. Together, repeat Pap smears and HPV testing should identify most patients with underlying cervical dysplasia. Combined testing may also minimize the number of unnecessary colposcopic examinations in women who have no disease."
CD008054,0,8490673,0,Determinants of the geographic variation of invasive cervical cancer in Costa Rica.,"The incidence of cervical cancer in Costa Rica is about twice as high in the coastal regions as in the interior. To study these regional variations, we used data from a 1986-1987 case-control study of 192 Costa Rican women with invasive cervical cancer and 372 controls. Risk factors identified included the following: The study participant's (1) number of sexual partners, (2) age at first sexual intercourse, (3) number of live births, (4) presence of type 16/18 human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, (5) venereal disease (VD) history, (6) Pap smear history, and (7) socioeconomic status. The adjusted relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each of these risk factors were as follows: (1) > or = 4 vs. 1 sexual partner: RR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.1-3.5; (2) age of initiation < or = 15 vs. > or = 18 years: RR = 1.5, 95% CI = 0.9-2.5; (3) > or = 6 vs. < or = 1 live birth: RR = 1.7, 95% CI = 0.7-3.9; (4) HPV 16/18 DNA in cervix: RR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.9-4.2; (5) VD history: RR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-4.0; (6) no Pap smear: RR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.5-3.8; and (7) low socioeconomic status: RR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.2-3.2. The population-attributable risks related to HPV detection, four or more sexual partners, six or more live births, no prior Pap smear, and low socioeconomic status were 39%, 38%, 29%, 23%, and 22%, respectively. Several of the sexual and reproductive risk factors were relatively more prevalent in the high-risk region, but Pap screening and detection of HPV were equally prevalent in the high-risk and low-risk regions. Though differences in screening quality (laboratory and follow-up) may have been involved, we conclude that the observed regional differences reflect behavioral more than screening differences. This suggests that screening programs should be more aggressive in the high-risk area, given the more frequent occurrence of the disease there. Failure to detect a higher prevalence of HPV in the high-risk region could reflect weaknesses in the in situ hybridization test employed. Alternatively, cofactors may have to be present in order for HPV to exert its role in cervical carcinogenesis."

A negative HPV test in combination with a normal Pap test result in women age 30 years or older allows the safe extension of the cervical screening interval to 3 years. However, because HPV infection is common in young women and is usually transient, HPV testing is not recommended as part of primary cervical screening for women younger than 30 years. HPV testing is recommended for women of any age as a triage test with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) results and as an option for follow-up of women with HPV-positive ASC-US, atypical squamous cells ""cannot rule out high-grade"", low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, or atypical granular cells not found to have CIN 2/3.

However, the role of the virus in the progression of the disease, i.e. in the development of lymph node metastasis and in the adverse clinical outcome is poorly understood. We have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study the presence and typing of human papillomavirus DNA since 1980 in cervical cancers and pelvic lymph nodes from the same patients. Out of the series of 47 cervical cancer patients we focused on four women (age: 41, 33, 35 and 56 years) in this article. The follow-up of these patients revealed early recurrences of the disease (7, 7, 17, 22 months) with very short survival (9, 10, 21, 24 months). Although we detected HPV-18 positivity both in the cervical tumors and in the regional lymph nodes too in all four cases, lymph nodes were negative by routine hystology in case of the three young patients (21, 33, 35 years of age). Our observations suggest that HPV type 18 positive cervical cancer patients, despite negative histological findings in the lymph nodes should be consider as a subpopulation for poor outcome especially in the young age group (p=0,022, Fisher's exact test)."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of ERCC1 expression as a predictive marker of survival in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) treated with cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). ERCC1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. The median age of the 45 patients analysed was 56 years (range 27-75 years), and 82% were men; 73% of all specimens showed high expression of ERCC1. The overall tumour response rate after CCRT was 89%. The median follow-up was 53.6 months (95% CI, 34.5-72.7 months). The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 58.7 and 61.3%, respectively. Univariate analyses showed that patients with low expression of ERCC1 had a significantly higher 3-year PFS (83.3 vs 49.4%, P=0.036) and OS (91.7 vs 45.5%, P=0.013) rates. Multivariate analysis showed that low expression of ERCC1 was an independent predictor for prolonged survival (HR, 0.120; 95% CI, 0.016-0.934, P=0.043). These results suggest that ERCC1 expression might be a useful predictive marker of locally advanced SCCHN in patients treated with cisplatin-based CCRT."

The prevalence of various HPV types in 32 patients with positive lymph nodes was compared to the prevalence found in 32 age-matched controls with negative lymph nodes. In both patient groups HPV DNA was found in all cases. The prevalence rates of HPV types 16, 18, and X in the positive and negative lymph node group were 78% versus 72%, 13% versus 9%, and 3% versus 16%, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant. HPV genotypes 6, 11, and 31 were not found. Differences in recurrence rate and 5-year survival rate between the patient groups with different tumor-containing HPV genotypes were not statistically significant. Nor was there any statistically significant relationship between HPV type and other well-known prognosticators. In conclusion, in our study a 100% HPV DNA prevalence was found in squamous cell cervical carcinomas. Neither the presence of HPV DNA nor the HPV genotype appeared to be related to either the presence of lymph node metastases at the time of initial treatment or to 5-year survival."

CD008054,0,18082853,0,The HPV vaccine mandate controversy.,"In this editorial we address the controversies surrounding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine school-entry mandate legislation, but differentiate between the mandate debate and issues specific to the vaccine itself. Our goal is not to take a stand in favor of or opposed to mandates, but rather to critically examine the issues. We discuss the following arguments against HPV vaccine school-entry requirements: 1. The public health benefit of mandated HPV vaccination is not sufficient to warrant the intrusion on parental autonomy; 2. A vaccine that prevents a non-casually transmitted infection should not be mandated; 3. Opt-out provisions are inherently unfair to parents who oppose HPV vaccination; 4. Limited health care dollars should not be directed toward cervical cancer prevention; and 5. The vaccine is expensive and potential problems with supply suggest that mandates should not be implemented until insurance coverage and supply issues are resolved. Next, we critically evaluate the following critiques of HPV vaccination itself: 1. Giving girls HPV vaccine implies tacit consent to engage in sexual activity; 2. Giving girls this vaccine will confer a false sense of protection from sexually transmitted infections and will lead to sexual disinhibition; 3. Children already have too many vaccinations on the immunization schedule; 4. Long-term side effects of HPV vaccine are unknown; 5. The vaccine's enduring effectiveness is unknown and booster shots may be required; and 6. It is wrong to only target girls with HPV vaccine; boys should be vaccinated as well."
CD008054,0,11494035,0,P53 and hMSH2 expression in basal cell carcinomas and malignant melanomas from photoexposed areas of head and neck region.,"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation plays a pivotal role in skin damage and photocarcinogenesis. The basic mechanism of phototoxicity lies in DNA damage, and involves mutation of tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes and genes directly involved in the control of the stability of genome, such as the mismatch repair (MR) genes. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of p53 and hMSH2 in the UV-related carcinogenetic process. An immunohistochemical study for p53 and hMSH2 was performed in a series of 43 basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and 60 melanomas (MM) from photoexposed areas of head and neck region, comparing the findings with follow-up. A deregulated p53 expression characterized less differentiated, more aggressive BCC (BCC2) but not the well-differentiated ones (BCC1). The hMSH2 protein was present, though expressed at varying levels, in 18 out of 21 BCC1 cases and in 4 out of 22 BCC2. In the remaining 3 cases of BCC1 and 18 cases of BCC2, a complete absence of hMSH2 expression was found, correlating directly with the presence of recurrence and/or death of the disease in case of melanoma (p<0.05). Overall, the expression of hMSH2 correlated inversely with the p53 overexpression (p<0.01). In MM, p53 was found overexpressed in 81.6% of the cases, and this correlated positively with the level of infiltration and with the presence of relapses (p<0.01) or metastasis (p<0.01) and inversely with the disease-free interval (p<0.05). These results are in agreement with the reported association between p53 deregulation and a more aggressive cancer phenotype. The evaluation of the expression of p53 and hMSH2 could improve the management of patients with BCC and MM, and could have a role also in the evaluation of the early cutaneous photo-inducted damage, contributing to the identification of presymptomatic patients predisposed to the development of UV-related new skin tumors, who could become candidates for chemoprevention trials."

The purpose of the present study is monitoring biochemical spectral changes accompanying viral cancer progression in cells and tissues using FTIR-MSP. As a model system, we used cells in culture which were transformed to malignant cells by infection with murine sarcoma virus (MuSV) and cervical tissues at different neoplastic stages. In order to devise a systematic follow-up of the cancer progression, it was essential first to determine and validate consistent and significant spectral biomarkers, which can evidently discriminate between normal and cancerous cells/tissues. Then these biomarkers were used for the characterization and classification of early stages of malignant transformation utilizing discriminant classification function techniques. Our study points out that malignancy progression can be eminently graded for both cell lines and tissues. For example, using the array of four biomarkers: A(2958)A(2852)+A(2923),A(1121)/A(1015),A(1171)/A(1152)and|A(1082)-A(1056)|A(1028), we attained that the classification accuracies of different premalignant stages of cell lines and tissues were varied between 89.5 and 97.4%.

Since sexual behaviour determines exposure to HPVs and the adolescent period may be particularly important in this regard it is of interest to consider behavioural determinants of teenagers. In one survey conducted in Khon Kaen, Thailand, some 62% percent of male and 19.3 % of female respondents aged 13-15 years reported having experienced sexual desire, and 19.1% of male and 4.7 % of female respondents admitted to sexual intercourse.

Mutations within the exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were found in 48 tumors (44%). Sequencing revealed in most cases mis-sense mutations (16/21). Frequency of p53 gene mutations was not related to the tumor stage or the presence of lymph node metastases. Of the 46 tumors that were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, 26 stained positively (56%). The number of positively stained nuclei increased slightly with decreasing differentiation of the tumors, whereas no correlation was found between tumor stage and immunoreactivity. An infection with the high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 could be detected in 39/92 tumor specimens (42%). Follow-up data were obtained from 99 patients within a range of 2 to 112 months. No dependence of overall survival on the presence of p53 gene mutations or HPV infection could be observed. The absence of statistically significant correlations between p53 gene mutation and progressive disease, however, does not deny its putative relevance in early phases of tumor development."
CD008054,0,20959485,0,Hierarchical clustering of human papilloma virus genotype patterns in the ASCUS-LSIL triage study.,"Anogenital cancers are associated with â¼13 carcinogenic human papilloma virus (HPV) types in a broader group that cause cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Multiple concurrent cervical HPV infections are common, which complicates the attribution of HPV types to different grades of CIN. Here we report the analysis of HPV genotype patterns in the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance-low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion triage study with the use of unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Women who underwent colposcopy at baseline (n = 2,780) were grouped into 20 disease categories based on histology and cytology. Disease groups and HPV genotypes were clustered with the use of complete linkage. Risk of 2-year cumulative CIN3+, viral load, colposcopic impression, and age were compared between disease groups and major clusters. Hierarchical clustering yielded four major disease clusters: cluster 1 included all CIN3 histology with abnormal cytology; cluster 2 included CIN3 histology with normal cytology and combinations with either CIN2 or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cytology; cluster 3 included older women with normal or low-grade histology/cytology and low viral load; and cluster 4 included younger women with low-grade histology/cytology, multiple infections, and the highest viral load. Three major groups of HPV genotypes were identified: group 1 included only HPV16; group 2 included nine carcinogenic types, plus noncarcinogenic HPV53 and HPV66; and group 3 included noncarcinogenic types, plus carcinogenic HPV33 and HPV45. Clustering results suggested that colposcopy missed a prevalent precancer in many women with no biopsy/normal histology and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. This result was confirmed by an elevated 2-year risk of CIN3+ in these groups. Our novel approach to study multiple genotype infections in cervical disease with the use of unsupervised hierarchical clustering can address complex genotype distributions on a population level."

Prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are an opportunity for primary prevention and new screening methods, such as new HPV DNA testing, are promising alternatives to cytology screening that should be analyzed in the context of regional preventive programs. Cytology-based screening programs have not fulfilled their expectations and coverage does not sufficiently explain the lack of impact on screening in LAC. While improved evaluation of screening programs is necessary to increase the impact of screening on the reduction of incidence and mortality, other programmatic aspects will need to be addressed such as follow-up of positive tests and quality control. The implementation of new technologies might enhance screening performance and reduce mortality in the region. The characteristics, performance and impact of cervical cancer screening programs in LAC are reviewed in this article."

Herein, we describe the case of a pregnant 30-year-old HIV-infected Ethiopian woman with a CD4 count of 254 cells/microL and an HIV viral load of 1200 copies/mL who presented to medical attention with progressive neck adenopathy. Subsequent histopathology and radiographic findings revealed clinical stage IIIA Classical HL. After a spontaneous miscarriage of 10 weeks into her pregnancy, the patient began highly active antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy. Thirty months later, she remained in complete remission. Through a literature review, we identified 2 additional case reports involving HIV, HL and pregnancy. One patient received 3 cycles of chemotherapy, refused further treatment, delivered an HIV-seropositive girl, and died shortly after from complications of presumed pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. The second patient received both active antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy, delivered an HIV-seronegative boy, and remained in complete remission at 9 months follow-up. We conclude by offering recommendations for the staging and treatment of pregnant, HIV-infected patients with HL."

There is persistent controversy on the role of HPV infection in HNSCC-progression, and on the influence of these infections on the final clinical outcome. To evaluate the possible relevance of HPV infection on survival and prognosis, 73 patients with HNSCC were investigated statistically with a median follow-up time of 28 (0.3-94) months. The statistical analysis revealed no differences in the overall survival of HPV-positive and HPV-negative cancer patients. A correlation between decreased survival and increased lymph node status was expected. Patients with carcinomas of the Waldeyer's tonsillar ring with a high HPV prevalence rate as compared to tumours of other anatomical locations revealed a better survival. Moreover, an association between HPV positivity and higher lymph node status at time of first diagnosis, and a better survival of HPV-positive patients compared to HPV-negative patients given the same initial nodal status (N0 vs. N1-N2b vs. N2c-N3) could be demonstrated. The influence of HPV on the patient's survival can only be observed statistically in combination with other prognostic factors, as the lymph nodal status of the patients. The better prognosis of survival of HPV-positive vs. the HPV-negative patients with lymph node neck metastasis is attributable to a better response of the HPV-positive group to therapy, especially radiotherapy."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the most appropriate and efficacious diagnostic methods for screening programs for cervical cancer in HIV-positive women. For Group 1 we also considered the value of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and morphologic and molecular follow-up from 3 to 6 months. The results showed that the abnormal transformation zone (ANTZ) was present in 66.3% of the cases in Group 1 compared with 31.4% in control-Group 2 (p<0.001), and with 58.93% of the cases in control-Group 3 (p=0.257); intraepithelial squamous lesions (SIL) were found in 50% vs 5.66% (p<0.001) and vs 56.25% of the cases (p=0.433), respectively. In 28.85% of the HIV-positive patients the first cytological screening exam was not evaluable due to inflammation but in 56.67% of the cases colposcopy revealed ANTZ. The subsequent colpocytological checkup after therapy showed 10 cases (30%) of low risk squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and two cases (6.6%) of high risk squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). HPV-DNA testing by PCR was positive in 53.8% of the cases in Group 1, in 6.6% in control-Group 2 and in 42% in control-Group 3. In HIV-positive patients multiple HPV genotypes were simultaneously present in 21.43% of the cases and high risk genotypes were present in 70% of the cases of HSIL. In Group 1, 36.61% of the cases had lesions of the lower genital tract. The value of CD4+ T-lympocytes was <200 cells/ml in 30% of the cases of HSIL. Our data, like those of other Authors, confirm a high incidence of HSIL, abnormal colposcopic findings, and HPV infections in HIV-positive women with respect to control-Group 2, while there was not much difference between Group 1 and control-Group 3. Such frequency again suggests that an integrated morphological diagnostic approach with colposcopy-colpocytology in the screening of immunosuppressed subjects would be worthwhile."
CD008054,0,9216698,0,DNA ploidy and HPV subtypes in cervical smears of HIV-sero-positive and negative patients.,"Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that cervical HPV infection and precancerous lesions of the cervix are more common in HIV-seropositive patients. However little is known about the natural history of these lesions in this population. In the present study cervical smears from 36 patients, 18 HIV-seropositive women and 18 matched controls were evaluated with the aim of quantifying morphological alterations and to evaluate DNA ploidy and HPV subtypes. Cervical lesions in HIV-seropositive patients were diploid in 50% of the cases compared to 25% in controls. The only HPVs identified by ISH were types 16/18 and no significant differences were observed in the control population. In contrast, cytological evidence of HPV infection and dysplastic changes was greatly increased in smears from HIV patients compared to HIV-seronegative women. Less than 5% of the cells showed HPV associated changes in controls while 10% to 30% of the cells were affected in HIV-patients. We suggest that the Papanicolaou test should be effective for detecting cervical disease and for a close follow-up of this population. Moreover, while additional studies with larger population groups and different population bases are needed, these findings are suggestive of the possible use of morphological criteria for the identification of HIV-seropositive subjects."
CD008054,0,8827362,0,Human papillomavirus and cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract: a review of epidemiological and experimental evidence.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are recognized as important causes of cancer of the anogenital tract and may be involved also in the etiology of cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT). Epidemiological and experimental evidence lend some support to this possibility. Increased risk of cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx subsequent to the occurrence of cancer of the cervix has been found and suggests common etiological factors besides smoking. HPV has been found in a substantial proportion of benign UADT lesions, most notably laryngeal papillomas and oral verrucal-papillary lesions. Largest and most accurate case series (i.e., > 15 UADT cancer cases, based on best HPV detection techniques) showed HPV DNA in 46% of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, 15% of cancers of the esophagus, and 24% of cancers of the larynx, with however, great discrepancies from one study to another. An additional 14 case series with a comparison group of noncancer patients revealed approximately a 4-fold higher HPV prevalence in UADT cancer tissues than in normal ones. The only two strictly designed case-control studies dealt with cancer of the oral cavity and provided inconclusive results, possibly because of interference of primary treatment with HPV detection in buccal exfoliated cells. An increasing bulk of experimental and in vitro evidence suggests that at least a proportion of UADT cancers harbor a relatively high copy number of HPV DNA. E6/E7 region transcripts and a clonal association with HPV have been demonstrated in these tumors. The combination of a good study design with reliable and noninvasive viral measurement will ultimately allow researchers to elucidate the role of HPV in the development of UADT cancer. Allowance for the strong effect of smoking, alcohol drinking, and betel quid chewing on UADT cancer and exclusion of noncausal associations will be the most difficult challenges of such studies."

We examined the pre-radiotherapy tumor potential doubling time (Tpot) evaluated after in vivo infusion of bromodeoxyuridine and flow-cytometric analysis and the early clinical tumor regression after 40 Gy (40 Gy-TR). Tpot values and clinical 40 Gy-TR classes (minor and major) were available for 82 HN-SCC patients. Radiation therapy completion was done either with 1 dose per day (conventional regimen) or 2 doses per day (accelerated regimen). Local control was also available for follow-up times above 4 years. We found that major 40 Gy-TR was strongly correlated with fast tumor growth, characterized by Tpot values below 5 days, and that patients with major 40 Gy-TR showed better local control than those with minor 40 Gy-TR, independently from the radiotherapy regimen type. We also found that treatment completion with accelerated radiotherapy gave better local control for patients with major 40 Gy-TR and fast tumor growth than conventional radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis, performed on all patients, assigned an independent prognostic value to Tpot, tumor classification and 40 Gy-TR."

CD008054,0,9303366,0,Present evidence on the value of HPV testing for cervical cancer screening: a model-based exploration of the (cost-)effectiveness.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main risk factor for invasive cervical cancer. High risk ratios are found in cross-sectional data on HPV prevalence. The question raised is whether this present evidence is sufficient for making firm recommendations on HPV screening. A validated cervical cancer screening model was extended by adding HPV infection as a possible precursor of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Two widely different model quantifications were constructed so that both were compatible with the observed HPV risk ratios. One model assumed a much longer duration of HPV infection before progressing to CIN and a higher sensitivity of the HPV test than the other. In one version of the model, the calculated mortality reduction from HPV screening was higher and the (cost-)effectiveness was much better than for Pap smear screening. In the other version, outcomes were the opposite, although the cost-effectiveness of the combined HPV + cytology test was close to that of Pap smear screening. Although small follow-up studies and studies with limited strength of design suggest that HPV testing may well improve cervical cancer screening, only large longitudinal screening studies on the association between HPV infection and the development of neoplasias can give outcomes that would enable a firm conclusion to be made on the (cost-)effectiveness of HPV screening. Prospective studies should address women aged 30-60 years."
CD008054,0,16858685,0,Telomeres: prognostic markers for solid tumors.,"Solid tumors continue to affect millions of people worldwide. Increasingly sophisticated diagnostic tools contribute to the high incidence rates for some tumor types, and treatment options continue to expand. However, the progression of solid tumors represents a challenge for the appropriate treatment of individual patients because of the relative inaccuracy of current prognostic markers, including the widely used Tumor-Nodes-Metastasis (TNM) staging system, to predict the course of disease. As a result, both over- and undertreatment are clinical realities in the management of patients diagnosed with solid tumors. Therefore, population-based screening programs that increase the overall cancer incidence rates are controversial, as they may do little to improve the patient's quality of life. Consequently, there is a strong need to develop novel and independent markers of prognosis. In this context, we review the use of telomeres as prognostic markers for solid tumors, including cancers from lung, breast, prostate, colon, brain and head and neck. Telomeric sequences, the repetitive DNA at the end of human chromosomes, are mediators of genomic stability and can undergo length alterations during tumor initiation and progression. In a number of studies reviewed here, these alterations, measured as telomere attrition and elongation, have been shown either to be associated with clinical markers of disease progression or to be independent markers of cancer prognosis. We conclude from these studies that careful assessment of telomere length or its proxies, such as telomere DNA content, will be part of novel risk assessment and prognostic modalities for patients with solid tumors."

However, cervical cancer remains an important health problem in Croatia when compared to European countries with organised screening programmes. In Croatia, in addition to screening based on well established cytology, Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is widely used as secondary test as a triage to borderline cytology and as a follow-up after treatment of severe cervical lesions. Many different approaches for HPV testing arose in Croatia over the last decade depending on the needs of each medical institution involved. Presently, there is an urgent need for better networking between the laboratories, the implementation of quality assessment and the adaptation of a uniform system of referring to and reporting of HPV testing. In conclusion, the best possible organisation for HPV testing would be essential for implementation of HPV testing as primary screening test in Croatia, an thus ultimately and hopefully, the more successful cervical cancer control."

Cervical cancer is preventable if high quality screening programmes, diagnosis and treatment are offered to female populations at high coverage. Nevertheless, it continues to be a public health problem, and screening programmes need improvements. Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been firmely established as the necessary cause of virtually all cervical cancer cases. To date we count two clinically validated and approved HPV technologies, available to prevent cervical cancer, and other diseases caused by these carcinogenic viruses: Prophylactic vaccines for primary prevention, and HPV DNA tests for secondary prevention, to detect life threatening infections by carcinogenic HPV types, allowing timely diagnosis and clinical management of precancerous lesions. The new technologies will help improve the health of the public if made widely accessible. Similar to vaccination programmes, systematic and well organized cervical screening programmes, with high quality validated HPV tests, can save more lives than ever and improve women's health, in an effective manner."

We therefore explored the utility of p16INK4a immunostaining as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for cervical neoplasia using paraffin-embedded tissue blocks (punch biopsies and loop electrosurgical excision procedures) obtained from women referred to colposcopy during the enrollment phase of the Guanacaste Project (1993 to 1994). All blocks from 292 women selected by HPV status (HPV negative, nononcogenic HPV positive, or oncogenic HPV positive) and representing the diagnostic spectrum of the population [normal to precancer: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3] were immunostained for p16INK4a using the p16INK4a research kit based on the monoclonal antibody clone E6H4 (MTM Laboratories, Heidelberg, Germany). For CIN3, the sensitivity of diffuse p16INK4a immunostaining was 100% and the specificity was 95%. For CIN2, the sensitivity and specificity for diffuse staining were 81.1% and 95.4%, respectively. Generalized to the 10,000-woman cohort, this translated to positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 13.9% and 100% for CIN3, respectively, and 20.4% and 99.7% for CIN2 or CIN3, respectively. Of women with an initial diagnosis of less than CIN2 for whom follow-up data for up to 5 to 7 years were available, 44% with diffuse staining developed persistent infection (CIN2 or CIN3). Whereas our data support the diagnostic potential for p16INK4a, further prospective studies with detailed follow-up determining the prognostic capacity of this marker are needed."

CD008054,0,19061822,0,Management of adolescents who have abnormal cytology and histology.,"Adolescents have been shown to have the highest rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The cause is likely a combination of sexual risk behavior and biologic vulnerability. Most HPV and its associated abnormal cytology are transient, with frequent clearance of HPV and the lesion. These findings have resulted in new strategies, including observation, for adolescents who have abnormal cytology. For cytologic atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, adolescents should be followed with cytology at 1-year intervals for up to 2 years before referral for colposcopy is necessary. For biopsy-proved cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, management is similar, with yearly cytology indefinitely or until high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or CIN 2,3 develops. CIN 2,3 in compliant adolescents can be managed with 6-month cytology and colposcopy up to 2 years."

However, due to a well-organised screening programme, cervical cancer is not an important public health problem in the Netherlands any more, which limits the possible impact of HPV vaccination. Vaccine trials thus far have involved a relatively small number ofparticipants with limited follow-up, so the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing cervical cancer is not yet known. There are no data on frequency and severity of possible adverse events and the vaccine has not yet been tested in the intention-to-vaccinate group of 12-year-old girls. Even when we assume that HPV16/18-related cervical cancer is prevented on a lifelong basis, the cost-effectiveness ratio of HPV vaccination is estimated not to be favourable. In conclusion, HPV vaccination does not seem to be urgent in the Netherlands. Therefore we advise studying the safety in 12-year-old girls first while at the same time waiting for the longer follow-up results of ongoing trials."

HPV-16 was the dominant type in both groups of women. Because of the high oncogenic potential of HPV-16 and the greater chance of its persistence, a follow-up of cases with minor cervical abnormalities harboring HPV-16 is warranted in order to observe the progression of the lesion. As many as 61.5% of the cases with invasive cervical cancer were found to have higher levels of serum p53 protein than did healthy controls. None of the patients had antibodies against the overexpressed p53. This suggests that, even if mutated, the p53 protein may not be immunogenic in all cases. An inverse relationship between the presence of HPV and the alteration in p53 expression was observed in 71.43% of the cases. This could mean the loss of p53 function as a result of either HPV-E6-mediated degradation or mutation in the p53 gene."

New prospective studies help predict which patients are at the highest risk for occult metastases and may benefit from lymph node dissection. In particular, the role of tumor depth, desmoplasia, and degree of immunosuppression could be accounted for in a more specific classification system. Evidence from studies of mucosal SCCs suggests a role for sentinel lymph node biopsies for carcinomas of the head and neck in place of selective neck dissection, a finding that may be relevant to cutaneous head and neck cancers as well. In the field of SCC pathogenesis, the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cutaneous, as well as mucous membrane, SCCs is being further characterized.

We have followed up 95 women from that group who had histologically proven mild-grade cervical disease (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1, n = 37) or wart virus infection (n = 12) or who had no evidence of cervical abnormality at study entry (n = 43). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the 70 months' follow-up was used to identify baseline features that might affect the risk of progression. 3 women were lost to follow-up; data were available for the remaining 92. Among the whole group the probability of remaining free of high-grade cervical disease was 0.71. Women with a histological diagnosis of minor-grade disease were more likely to progress to high-grade disease than those with no evidence of abnormality (proportion disease-free 0.52 vs 0.90, p = 0.004). Stratification of the group according to median age (28 years) revealed a weak association between age and disease progression (p = 0.04). There was no difference in disease-free probability between HPV16-positive and HPV16-negative women (0.75 vs 0.65, p = 0.19). Nor was there a significant difference in disease-free probability when the group was stratified by HPV16 viral burden. These data show that a histological diagnosis of minor-grade cervical disease is a better long-term predictor of disease progression than is HPV16 positivity, irrespective of copy number. These findings do not support the simple view that HPV16 alone is the cause of high-grade cervical disease, including cancer."
CD008054,0,12436487,1,Human papillomavirus DNA detection in the management of women with twice mildly abnormal cytological smears.,"This study was undertaken to investigate the value of HPV testing in women referred with two abnormal smears that were graded as mild dyskaryosis or less who attended for at least three follow-up visits. One hundred forty-nine women were included in the study and a total of 39 high-grade lesions including one cancer were detected. All of these were found to be associated with the persistent presence of one or more of 13 high-risk human papillomavirus types (HPV) as detected by a multiplex type specific PCR technique. Two high-grade lesions were initially missed by cytology. In contrast, no cytological or histological evidence of high-grade lesions was found during a follow-up period of up to 8 years in 62 women with no high-risk HPV infection or in 38 women with only transient high-risk HPV infection. The utility of high-risk HPV detection in the management of women presenting with mild cytological abnormalities is discussed."

The HPV DNA was present in 20 out of the 21 (95%) squamous-cell carcinoma tissues, including 13 cases of HPV-16, 0 case of HPV-18, and 7 cases of other HPV types. In the other 5 adenocarcinoma tissues, 3 had HPV type-18 DNA and 2 had no detectable HPV DNA. The distribution of HPV DNA in bulky tumors was not statistically different from that in the other 228 squamous-cell carcinomas and 23 adenocarcinomas of smaller size operated upon during the same period. Out of the 26 patients, 9 (35%) had lymph node metastasis at the time of operation. During the follow-up period ranging from 19 to 48 months, 9 patients had recurrence and 7 of them died of disease. The distribution of HPV types was not related to the prognosis in these patients. There were no p53 mutations detected in all the 26 samples. Thus, HPV type and the status of p53 could not serve as additional prognostic factors in stage IB bulky cervical cancers."

Of 232 women who attended colposcopy, 214 (92.2%) had a normal outcome, 12 (5.2%) had low grade abnormalities, and six (2.6%) had high grade abnormalities. This group of women therefore has a negligibly increased risk of harbouring cervical neoplasia. Although not directly comparable, women with a history of previous abnormal cytology did not have a higher risk than those without such a history. Unnecessary colposcopy could have been avoided in the majority of cases if a good quality repeat smear had been taken. Improved smear taker training could decrease the number of referrals.

This is something that reaffirms the association with HPV by 96.5% versus 80% the last century. In relation to HPV infection, we found that the ""pure"" form was not only reached but rather surpassed by the findings associated with cancer and dysplasia in the years 2005-2006, a behavior considered irregular as compared to the usual. The majority of the patients were guided toward conservative local treatments, among which cryosurgery and cauterization prevailed as choices, and their evolution resulted in an 81% cure (considered as destruction of the lesion and negativity of the cytology and eventual biopsy). It can be concluded that the high vulnerability of the virus, in spite of its great aggressiveness as an oncogenic risk (OR) to a cervical-uterine lesion, can be supported by the high degree of lesions diagnosed by OR."

CD008054,0,11437923,0,Biologic factors and response to radiotherapy in carcinoma of the cervix.,"Ionizing radiation has been used to treat cancers for a century. However, radioresistance remains a major problem in the clinic. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular events that occur following ionizing radiation leading to DNA damage and repair, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrests suggest new ways in which the radiation response might be manipulated. Seventy-eight cases of carcinoma of the cervix of the same stage (II A and B) were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were treated with radiotherapy (RT) with a dose varying from 35 Gy to 50 Gy with 200 cGy per fraction. Subsequent to the completion of radiotherapy, all patients underwent surgery 4-6 weeks later. On histological examination of the surgical specimens, 51% of the cases (40) showed a complete response to therapy with no viable tumor cells. 49% of cases (38) had residual tumors ranging from a small focus to lesions extending through more than half the thickness of the cervical wall. p53 (mutant), bcl-2, p21 and bax proteins were studied on the paraffin sections of the biopsies (pretreatment) of those patients who failed to respond to RT and compared to similar studies on biopsies of patients who had a complete response to RT. In addition, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 2 proliferative marker was also done on all cases. Expression of all proteins was done using immunohistochemsitry. In the radioresistant cases, 15% (six cases) showed positivity for bcl-2 and p21, respectively, and 34% (13 cases) showed mutant p53. None of the radiosensitive tumors were positive for the above proteins. 75% of the radiosensitive tumors (30 cases) were positive for the bax antibody, whereas 81% of the radioresistant tumors (31 cases) were negative for bax. The MCM2 proliferative marker was positive in > 80% of cells in 81.5% of radioresistant tumors (31 cases) as compared to < 40% of cells that were positive in 70% of radiosensitive tumors (28 cases). The P-value for the biological markers was calculated using the chi-squared test, and was highly significant (P < 0.01) for all the parameters tested. However, there was no statistical significance by univariate analysis when the dose of radiation was analyzed with respect to the markers and the histological response. There was also no correlation between the radiation response and timing of surgery. The above data strongly suggest that bax, along with proliferative markers, could play a role in determining which tumors are likely to respond to radiation therapy. The presence of bcl-2, p21 and p53 could also be related to radioresistance of the tumors."

CD008054,0,18682715,1,Human papillomavirus 'reflex' testing as a screening method in cases of minor cytological abnormalities.,"The aim was to evaluate human papillomavirus (HPV) 'reflex genotyping' in cases of minor cytological abnormalities detected in the gynaecological screening programme in Stockholm, Sweden. Liquid-based cytology samples showing minor cytological abnormalities were analysed using HPV genotyping (Linear Array, Roche diagnostics). Colposcopically directed cervical biopsies were obtained and the HPV test results were correlated with the histological results. In all, 63% (70/112) of the samples were high-risk (HR) HPV (HR-HPV) positive. A statistically significant correlation was found between high-grade cervical lesions and HR-HPV (P=0.019), among which HPV 16, 18, and 31 were the most important. The negative predictive value of HR-HPV detection for histologically confirmed high-grade lesions was 100%. An age limit for HPV reflex testing may be motivated in cases of low-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (LSIL), because of high HR-HPV prevalence among younger women. By using HPV reflex genotyping, additional extensive workup can safely be avoided in about 50% of all cases of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and LSIL among women 30 years. This screening strategy could potentially reduce the total abnormal cytology-reporting rate in the Swedish screening programme by about 1% and provide more accurately directed follow-up, guided by cytological appearance and HPV test results."

Most infected women clear the virus without developing cervical lesions and it is likely that immunological host factors affect susceptibility to cervical cancer. The impact of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus on the risk of cervical cancer is established and several other genes involved in immunological pathways have been suggested as biologically plausible candidates. The aim of this study was to examine the potential role of polymorphisms in 4 candidate genes by analysis of 1,306 familial cervical cancer cases and 288 controls. The following genes and polymorphisms were studied: Chemokine receptor 2 (CCR-2) V64I; Interleukin 4 receptor alpha (IL-4R) I75V, S503P and Q576R; Interleukin 10 (IL-10) -592; and Fas ligand (FasL) -844. The CCR-2 64I variant was associated with decreased risk of cervical cancer; homozygote carriers of the 64I variant had an odds ratio of 0.31 (0.12-0.77). This association was detected in both carriers and noncarriers of the HLA DQB1*0602 cervical cancer risk allele. The IL-4R 75V variant was associated with increased risk of cervical tumors, cases homozygote for 75V had an odds ratio of 1.91 (1.27-2.86) with a tendency that the association was stronger in noncarriers of the DQB1*0602 allele.

CD008054,0,14997202,0,A population-based study on the risk of cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia among grand multiparous women in Finland.,"Previous studies suggest that high parity increases the risk of cervical cancer. We studied the risk of cervical cancer (CC) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) in a Finnish cohort of grand multiparous (GM) women (at least five children) with low prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI). The Finnish Cancer Registry data revealed 220 CC and 178 CIN3 cases among 86 978 GM women. Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated from the numbers of observed and expected cases. Interval analyses by parity, age at first birth and average birth interval were done using multivariate Poisson regression. Seroprevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and Chlamydia trachomatis was tested among 561 GM women and 5703 women with 2-4 pregnancies. The incidence among GM women was slightly above the national average for squamous cell carcinoma of cervix uteri (SIR 1.21, 95% CI 1.05-1.40) and CIN3 (1.37, 95% CI 1.17-1.58), but lower for adenocarcinoma (SIR 0.77, 95% CI 0.52-1.10). The seroprevalence of HPV16 and Chlamydia trachomatis among GM women was lower than in the reference population, except among those women who had their child under age 19. Age under 20 years at first birth increased the risk of CC and CIN3 especially in premenopausal GM women, while increasing parity had no effect. The small relative risks of CC and CIN3 among GM women in our study as compared to studies from other countries can be explained by the exceptionally low prevalence of STIs in Finnish GM women. The observed SIRs between 1.2 and 1.4 should be interpreted to represent increased risk attributable to grand multiparity. The increased incidence of CC and CIN3 among young GM women suggests causal association to HPV 16 and Chlamydia trachomatis infections."

CD008054,0,19535232,0,Radiochemotherapy in locally advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is a common disease that develops in the upper aerodigestive epithelium. The most important risk factors are tobacco and alcohol consumption. There is also increasing evidence that human papillomavirus plays an important role in the cause of SCCHN. The complex anatomy, the vital functions of the upper aerodigestive tract and the close proximity to vital structures, explain that the goal of treatment is not only to improve survival outcomes, but also to preserve organ function. Radiotherapy and surgery are the standard modalities of treatment, reflecting the locoregional predominance of SCCHN. Chemotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of patients with locoregionally advanced disease, in conjunction with radiotherapy and surgery. Indeed, standard therapy for resectable locoregionally advanced (stage III or IV) SCCHN cancers consists either of surgery and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy or definitive concomitant chemoradiotherapy, depending upon disease site, stage and resectability of the tumour, or institutional experience. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy has been shown in several randomised trials to improve disease-free and overall survival in the postoperative setting for resected disease with poor prognostic factors. Furthermore, multiple randomised studies and meta-analyses have shown that definitive chemoradiotherapy, as well anti-epidermal growth factor receptor treatment in one randomised study, improved disease-free and overall survival when compared with radiotherapy alone. This overview reviews the most relevant published studies on the multidisciplinary management of SCCHN and discusses future strategies to reduce locoregional failures."

Accumulation of somatic genetic events in genes implicated in cell growth and differentiation lead to cell transformation and to the acquisition of cancer phenotype. The most frequent alterations in head and neck cancer results from chromosomal instability with amplification and deletion of recurrent chromosome arms. Among the genes that drives head and neck carcinogenesis, TP53 mutations, p16 deletion or hypermethylation, amplification of cyclinD1 and overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor are of the most importance and will be discuss in this review. Correlation between genetic alterations and clinical parameters will be underlined. Indeed, the identification of molecular alterations linked to specific tumor parameters may be of help in the management of head and neck cancer patients or useful in the development of new therapeutic strategies. Finally, studies have shown that in some part, constitutional genetic background could also interfere with the development of head and neck cancer through the existence of polymorphisms in carcinogens metabolizing enzymes and/or DNA repair enzymes. Individuals with low carcinogens elimination or DNA repair capacities could therefore be at risk of head and neck cancer.

All cases (23 B cell & 10 T cell) were immunostained for p53 protein using the mAb D07 (Novocastra) and the avidin biotin peroxidase method. EBER in situ hybridization was performed using a fluorescein conjugated EBV oligonucleotide probe (Dako). Among 33 lymphomas, 16 cases stained positively for p53 protein. P53 expression was frequent both in higher grade lymphomas and in advanced stage. Nine cases were EBER positive, EBER was more commonly found in T cell lymphomas than in B cell lymphomas (70% vs 8.7%). EBER positive lymphomas showed a higher frequency of p53 positivity than EBER negative lymphomas (78% vs 38%), although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.095). These findings indicate altered expression of p53 protein occurs in H&N lymphomas, especially in late event lymphoma progression and appears to play a role in the development of EBER positive T cell lymphomas."

Evaluation of screening performance of effective, feasible and affordable early detection and management methods is a public health priority. Five screening methods, naked eye visual inspection of the cervix uteri after application of diluted acetic acid (VIA), or Lugol's iodine (VILI) or with a magnifying device (VIAM), the Pap smear and human papillomavirus testing with the high-risk probe of the Hybrid Capture-2 assay (HC2), were evaluated in 11 studies in India and Africa. More than 58,000 women, aged 25-64 years, were tested with 2-5 screening tests and outcome verification was done on all women independent of the screen test results. The outcome was presence or absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) of different degrees or invasive cervical cancer. Verification was based on colposcopy and histological interpretation of colposcopy-directed biopsies. Negative colposcopy was accepted as a truly negative outcome. VIA showed a sensitivity of 79% (95% CI 73-85%) and 83% (95% CI 77-89%), and a specificity of 85% (95% CI 81-89%) and 84% (95% CI 80-88%) for the outcomes CIN2+ or CIN3+, respectively. VILI was on average 10% more sensitive and equally specific. VIAM showed similar results as VIA. The Pap smear showed lowest sensitivity, even at the lowest cutoff of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (57%; 95% CI 38-76%) for CIN2+ but the specificity was rather high (93%; 95% CI 89-97%). The HC2-assay showed a sensitivity for CIN2+ of 62% (95% CI 56-68%) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI 92-95%). Substantial interstudy variation was observed in the accuracy of the visual screening methods. Accuracy of visual methods and cytology increased over time, whereas performance of HC2 was constant. Results of visual tests and colposcopy were highly correlated. This study was the largest ever done that evaluates the cross-sectional accuracy of screening tests for cervical cancer precursors in developing countries. The merit of the study was that all screened subjects were submitted to confirmatory investigations avoiding to verification bias. A major finding was the consistently higher sensitivity but equal specificity of VILI compared with VIA. Nevertheless, some caution is warranted in the interpretation of observed accuracy measures, since a certain degree of gold standard misclassification cannot be excluded. Because of the correlation between visual screening tests and colposcopy and a certain degree of over-diagnosis of apparent CIN2+ by study pathologists, it is possible that both sensitivity and specificity of VIA and VILI were overestimated. Gold standard verification error could also explain the surprisingly low sensitivity of HC2, which contrasts with findings from other studies."

Using demographic, epidemiological, and cancer data from Brazil, we developed a dynamic transmission model of HPV infection between males and females. Model-projected reductions in HPV incidence under different vaccination scenarios were applied to a stochastic model of cervical carcinogenesis to project lifetime costs and benefits. We assumed vaccination prevented HPV-16 and -18 infections in individuals not previously infected, and protection was lifelong. Coverage was varied from 0-90% in both genders, and cost per-vaccinated individual was varied from IUSD 25 to 400. At 90% coverage, vaccinating girls alone reduced cancer risk by 63%; including boys at this coverage level provided only 4% further cancer reduction. At a cost per-vaccinated individual of USD 50, vaccinating girls alone was <USD 200 per year of life saved (YLS), while including boys ranged from USD 810-18,650 per YLS depending on coverage. For all coverage levels, increasing coverage in girls was more effective and less costly than including boys in the vaccination programme. In a resource-constrained setting such as Brazil, our results support that the first priority in reducing cervical cancer mortality should be to vaccinate pre-adolescent girls."

CD008054,0,11489488,0,Tumor-targeted p53-gene therapy enhances the efficacy of conventional chemo/radiotherapy.,"A long-standing goal in gene therapy for cancer is a stable, low toxic, systemic gene delivery system that selectively targets tumor cells, including metastatic disease. Progress has been made toward developing non-viral, pharmaceutical formulations of genes for in vivo human therapy, particularly cationic liposome-mediated gene transfer systems. Ligand-directed tumor targeting of cationic liposome-DNA complexes (lipoplexes) is showing promise for targeted gene delivery and systemic gene therapy. Lipoplexes directed by ligands such as folate, transferrin or anti-transferrin receptor scFv, showed tumor-targeted gene delivery and expression in human breast, prostate, head and neck cancers. The two elements, ligand/receptor and liposome composition, work together to realize the goal of functional tumor targeting of gene therapeutics. The tumor suppressor gene, p53, has been shown to be involved in the control of DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Loss or malfunction of this p53-mediated apoptotic pathway has been proposed as one mechanism by which tumors become resistant to chemotherapy or radiation. The systemically delivered ligand-liposome-p53 gene therapeutics resulted in efficient expression of functional wild-type p53, sensitizing the tumors to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This is a novel strategy combining current molecular medicine with conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer. The systemic delivery of normal tumor suppressor gene p53 by a non-viral, tumor-targeted delivery system as a new therapeutic intervention has the potential to critically impact the clinical management of cancer."

HR-HPV DNA was detected in 61 (62%), while HR-HPV E6/E7 mRNA was detected in 63 (64%) of the samples. Correlation between results from DNA analyses and the E6/E7 mRNA assay showed consistent results in 87% of samples (47 of 54). The results from these two methods in detecting presence of HPV infection of any type agreed in 77%. Overall agreement between the methods was seen in 82 of the 98 cases (84%). When evaluating change in sensitivity for detection of HPV positives by adding more HPV types to the HPV DNA assay, maximum sensitivity was reached by targeting four HPV types. The coverage of HPV DNA presence was 76.9%, while the E6/E7 mRNA assay achieved a maximum coverage of 80.8% using only three HPV types. Thus, E6/E7 oncogene expression analysis may provide a more objective test for assessment of neoplastic glandular cells. Further studies may reveal whether the clinical performance of the E6/E7 mRNA assay will be of prognostic value in management of cervical adenocarcinoma."

Thirty HIV-infected women were selected. Vaginal and endocervical samples were collected from 27 of them. The smears were examined by 3 experienced cytologists to diagnose the presence of HPV by the Papanicolaou technique and the results were compared to HPV detection and typing by PCR. HPV-infected patients were interviewed in order to identify the presence of risk factors for the acquisition of the virus. Eight of the 27 patients analyzed (29%) presented HPV in endocervical samples submitted to PCR, 6 of them (75%) presented HPV involving a high risk of development of cervical cancer. For 5 of these patients, the cytologic diagnosis was not confirmed by PCR. When cellular immunocompetence was related to HPV infection, PCR revealed a diagnosis of HPV in 37.50% of the patients at intermediate risk for HPV infection and in 83.33% of the patients at high risk for HPV infection. These immunologically compromised HPV-infected patients are at higher risk of developing cervical neoplasia. We showed here that PCR is adequate for HPV detection and that, if only the Papanicolaou method is used for the follow-up of these patients, we will not provide good prevention of cervical cancer."

CD008054,0,18611087,0,Ethnic disparities in cervical cancer illness burden and subsequent care: a prospective view in managed care.,"Costs associated with cervical neoplasia and cancer impose a significant burden on managed care. More than 50,000 cases are diagnosed annually in the United States, accumulating approximately $4.6 billion in costs per year. The apparent disparity of care related to screening and treatment among specific ethnic groups and economically disadvantaged subpopulations results in elevated cervical cancer mortality rates and adds to managed care's burden. This is likely the result of several factors, including differences in the stage of cervical cancer at diagnosis, cultural barriers to undergoing regular cervical screening, and impaired access to follow-up care after receiving abnormal Papanicolaou smear test results. To overcome socioeconomic and cultural barriers to providing adequate care for patients with cervical cancer, the implementation and effectiveness of secondary prevention methods should be revisited and options for primary prevention, such as human papillomavirus vaccination, should be explored. Vaccines have the potential to reduce disparities in care, particularly if they are provided to economically disadvantaged women or those whose culture serves as an obstacle to obtaining appropriate care. If action is not taken to broaden access to vaccines, it is likely that managed care will continue to bear the burden of increased costs due to poor outcomes."

CD008054,0,15163348,0,Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis infection among women in a Middle Eastern community.,"BACKGROUND: Common vaginal infections that manifest in women are usually easily diagnosed. However, Chlamydia infection is often asymptomatic, leading to infertility before it is detected. If it occurs in pregnancy, it could lead to significant neonatal morbidity. It may also play a role with other viral infections for e.g. Human Papilloma Virus in the development of cervical cancer. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Chlamydia infection in women undergoing screening for cervical abnormalities as a part of a research project in primary and secondary care institutions in the United Arab Emirates. METHODS: In this cross sectional study married women attending primary and secondary care participating in a large nationwide cervical abnormalities screening survey were offered Chlamydia testing using a commercially available test kit. This kit uses a rapid immunoassay for the direct detection of Chlamydia trachomatis antigen in endocervical swab specimens. As this study was performed in a traditional Islamic country, unmarried women were excluded from testing, as the management of any positive cases would create legal and social problems. All married women consenting to take part in the study were included irrespective of age. RESULTS: Of 1039 women approached over a period of eight months 919 (88.5%) agreed to participate. The number of women in the 16 to 19 years was small (0.01%) and 30% were aged over 40 years. The prevalence of Chlamydia infection in this study was 2.6% (95% confidence interval 1.2-3.3%), which was marginally higher in women screened in secondary care (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: This is one of the few reports on the prevalence of Chlamydia infection in women from the Middle East. Due to cultural and social constraints this study excluded a large proportion of women aged less than 19 years of age. Hence no direct comparisons on prevalence could be made with studies from the West, which all included younger women at high risk of Chlamydia. However this study emphasizes the importance of cultural factors while interpreting results of studies from different cultures and communities."
CD008054,0,15739081,0,Clinical and molecular prognostic factors in operable laryngeal cancer.,"Many factors affect the prognosis in operable laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Many clinical factors have been implicated in tumor recurrence and poor survival of the patients. The aim of the present study is to investigate the demographic, clinical and histological characteristics as prognostic factors. Moreover, our aim is to analyze the role of modern molecular biomarkers in the prognosis of patients with LSCC. One hundred patients with operable laryngeal carcinoma underwent surgery as primary treatment between April 1999 and April 2002. Ninety-four of them were men and 6 women, with a median age of 62 years (39-77). All demographic data of the patients were recorded. Staging of the tumor revealed 20 cases with T2 cancer, 46 cases with T3 and 34 cases with T4, while N classification included 91 patients with N0 tumor, 3 with N1 and 6 with N2. Among the 100 cases, 47 were located in the glottis, 46 in the supraglottic region and 7 were transglottic. Histology grading revealed 35 cases of grade G1, 50 cases of G2 and 15 cases of G3. Postoperatively, all patients were followed regularly for the possibility of tumor relapse, with a median follow-up period of 40.2 months (4.8-58.4). During the operation, a tissue specimen was collected from the tumor. The specimens were used for RNA and DNA extraction. Isolated RNA was used to investigate the expression of wt-p53, bcl-2, VEGF and EGFR by the reverse transcriptase PCR method (RT-PCR) using specific primers, while genomic DNA was used for the detection of EBV and HPV (16/18 subtypes) by the consensus primer-mediated polymerase chain reaction method (PCR). All data such as tumor recurrence and survival were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS and STATA statistical packages in order to investigate the role of all clinical and molecular factors and their combinations as significant prognostic markers. The tumor recurrence rate was 31%, while the tumor associated death rate was 27% and total death rate 30%. Univariate analysis for overall survival showed significance for the T stage, TNM stage and site of the tumor. Univariate analysis for the time to progression showed significance for the T stage, N stage, TNM stage, site of the tumor and tumors simultaneously positive for EGFR and VEGF, while EGFR expression was borderline insignificant. Multivariate analysis revealed TNM stage as the only significant factor for overall survival, and TNM stage, site of the tumor and EGFR expression as significant factors for time to progression. The molecular biomarkers EGFR and VEGF have a prognostic significance in laryngeal cancer in addition to the established clinical prognostic factors such as the stage and site of the tumor. These markers, apart from their role in carcinogenesis, seem to play an important role in tumor relapse."

Two hundred and seventy-two cervical samples were analyzed using hybrid capture II assay (HCA II) for HR-HPV. The frequency of HR-HPV in the study group was 44%. HR-HPV was detected in 25% of the women negative for squamous intraepithelial lesions (NSIL), 72% with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 68% with low SIL and 78% with high SIL. A moderate concordance was observed between HCA II assay and cytology (kappa: 0.43 IC(95% 0.3-0.5)). It was detected a high frequency of HR-HPV in women from 11 to 30 years old and in those over 60 years old. The data obtained in this study showed a high frequency of HR-HPV in woman with NSIL and ASCUS, which corroborate that the use of cytology together with HCA II assay for HR-HPV could improve remarkably the efficiency of screening programs of cervical cancer in Paraguay.

At entry, we detected HPV DNA in cervical samples by polymerase chain reaction-based methodology. Over the period of follow-up period, 46 lesions progressed to CIN 3 while 362 regressed to normal cytology. Women with multiple HPV infections were more likely to have persistent lesions (hazard ratio [HR] for regression, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-1.02; p = 0.07); however, multiple infections did not increase the risk of progression (HR for progression, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.37-2.94; p = 0.94). After adjusting for CIN grade and women's age, HRs for progression to CIN 3 (vs. women with low-risk types or negative for HPV DNA) varied markedly by HPV genotype: type 16 (11.1, 95% CI: 1.39-88.3); 18 (14.1, 0.65-306); 31 (24.7, 2.51-243); 33 (20.3, 1.78-231); 35 (13.7, 0.75-251); 52 (11.6, 1.45-93.3); 58 (8.85, 1.01-77.6); other high-risk types (4.04, 0.47-34.7). HPV 45 was not detected in our study subjects. The cumulative probability of CIN 3 within 5 years was 20.5% for HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 52 and 58; 6.0% for other high-risk types; 1.7% for low-risk types (p = 0.0001).

Three cases were analyzed for Ki-67 by immunohistochemistry and for p53 by immunohistochemistry and loss of heterozygosity. Seven patients were women, and one was a man (age range, 31 to 90 years). SCT were firm, were tan with areas of necrosis, and ranged in size from 2 to 8 cm. Histologically, they had islands of squamous cells with spindle cell areas (two of eight). In four of eight cases, SCT was associated with the tall cell variant of papillary carcinoma (TCV). Positive staining for p53 was seen in two of three cases, and in one of three the TCV was also positive for p53. Mean MIB1 labeling index was 30% and 17% in SCT and TCV, respectively. At the time of presentation, six of eight patients had cervical lymph node metastases. In one case, the primary tumor had SCT and TCV; however, only the SCT component metastasized. After mean follow-up of 48 months, one patient had died of disease, five were alive with recurrent or metastatic tumor, and two were lost to follow-up. Primary SCT is an aggressive neoplasm that may be found in association with TCV. p53 expression and high MIB1 labeling index occur in these tumors and may be useful prognosticators."

CD008054,0,10225298,0,The Bethesda system and evaluation of abnormal pap smears.,"The Bethesda Pap Smear system and its 1991 revisions aim to simplify Papanicolaou (Pap) smear reporting and make it more reproducible. It redefines the Pap smear request as a medical consultation. The pathologist consultant is required not only to provide the smear reading but also its clinical recommendation. The Bethesda system insists on a detailed Pap smear report assessing specimen adequacy and types of epithelial changes. Squamous cell abnormalities are grouped according to their biologic potential. Both cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade I (CIN I) (mild dysplasia) and human papillomavirus (HPV) lesions are grouped together as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL), while moderate and severe dysplasia (CIN II and III) belong to the high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) category. Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGCUS) need further qualification as to whether they favor either a reactive or neoplastic process. Guidelines for management of abnormal Pap smears are discussed in detail."
CD008054,0,20920878,0,Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: a unique disease on the rise?,"Despite successful efforts to control tobacco and alcohol consumption in the western world, several developed countries report rising oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) incidence figures, specifically in young individuals. Similar to anogenital cancers, a significant proportion of OPSCC (up to 60%) is caused by sexually acquired HPV infection and the rise in OPSCC has been attributed to changing sexual behaviours in the Western World. Accordingly, patients with HPV-positive OPSCC report divergent sexual histories and absence of classical risk factors as tobacco and alcohol exposure compared to patients with HPV-negative OPSCC. The profile of HPV-positive OPSCC differs from HPV-negative OPSCC in several other significant aspects, including a unique molecular biologic tumor characteristics and improved clinical behaviour. Thus, a further increase in HPV-positive OPSCC will impact significantly upon clinical management of OPSCC, unless it is halted by adequate preventive measures aimed at reduction of HPV-associated disease. HPV vaccination has been recently offered to young females in an attempt to reduce HPV-induced cervical cancer and may ultimately result in a decline of OPSCC incidence as well. Until then, close collaboration between otolaryngologists/head and neck surgeons and anogenital/genitourinary specialists is warranted to optimize clinical management of HPV-induced malignancy and improve detection of second primary tumor development."

CD008054,0,8050083,0,Cell kinetics and radiosensitivity of cervical squamous cell carcinoma.,Flow cytometry analyses of tumors from 12 patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma under radiotherapy were performed in this preliminary study. Six patients with a high (> 10%) G2/M fraction before treatment showed greater than 50% tumor reduction after initial 2000 cGy radiotherapy. Only two out of six patients with a low (< 10%) G2/M fraction before treatment responded favorably and three of them already had recurrence during the follow-up period of 33-40 months. Hyperploidy (DNA index > 1.1) was observed in 5 patients; all of them responded well to radiotherapy in contrast to three out of seven diploid tumors.
CD008054,0,11173147,0,Is there a future for cell kinetic measurements using IdUrd or BdUrd?,"The analysis of causes of radiation failure both in retrospective series of patients with head and neck cancer and in several randomized clinical trials suggests a loss of local control as the overall treatment time increases for the same total dose. This is attributed to tumor cell proliferation during fractionated radiotherapy. As longer treatment times lead to loss of local control, it has been suggested that shorter treatment times could lead to an increase in local control. For this reason accelerated treatment regimens have been and are being designed. However, these treatments may cause severe acute reactions. Due to this, lower total doses are sometimes given. Slowly proliferating tumors, therefore, may do worse when treated with accelerated schedules compared with conventional schedules. In addition, it is not desirable to subject all patients to the more intense acute reactions of accelerated schedules. It would thus be useful to predict which tumors will rapidly proliferate during treatment and are likely to benefit from accelerated radiotherapy. The potential doubling time (Tpot) is defined as the time within which the cell population of a tumor would double if there were no cell loss. The hypothesis is that the median Tpot measured before treatment might correlate with the effective doubling time (Tp) during treatment."

This is a retrospective study that evaluates p16 immunostaining using frozen material from 109 cases diagnosed as ASCUS and followed for an average of 16 months. The diagnosis of ASCUS was made using liquid-based cytology (Thin Prep, Hologic, Marlborough, MA). High-risk HPV using Hybrid Capture II was performed. The immunohistochemical evaluation of p16 immunoreactivity was done following Wentzensen criteria. In the series p16 immunoreactivity showed a sensitivity and negative predictive value for HSIL, of 82.3 and 94.5% with specificity and positive predictive value of 100%. The sensitivity was similar to that found using the HC-II, though the specificity was much higher. The use of p16 immunostain in cytologic specimens applying the Wentzensen criteria helps to focus the attention in positive cells evaluating the cell changes, helps to detect some cells suspicious or diagnostic of HSIL, and could help to reclassify the ASCUS cases."
CD008054,0,9888699,0,Mucinous cystic neoplasm (mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of low-grade malignant potential) of the pancreas: a clinicopathologic study of 130 cases.,"Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) of the pancreas are uncommon tumors. The classification and biologic potential of these neoplasms remain the subject of controversy. Attempts to classify these tumors in a similar manner to ovarian MCNs remains controversial, as even histologically benign-appearing pancreatic MCNs metastasize and are lethal. One hundred thirty cases of MCNs were identified in the files of the Endocrine Pathology Tumor Registry of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology from the years 1979 to 1993. The pathologic features, including hematoxylin and eosin staining, histochemistry, immunohistochemistry (IHC), cell cycle analysis, and K-ras oncogene determination were reviewed. These findings were correlated with the clinical follow-up obtained in all cases. There were 130 women, aged 20-95 years (mean age at the outset, 44.6 years). The patients had vague abdominal pain, fullness, or abdominal masses. More than 95% of the tumors were in the pancreatic tail or body and were predominantly multilocular. The tumors ranged in size from 1.5 to 36 cm in greatest dimension, with the average tumor measuring >10 cm. A spectrum of histomorphologic changes were present within the same case and from case to case. A single layer of bland-appearing, sialomucin-producing columnar epithelium lining the cyst wall would abruptly change to a complex papillary architecture, with and without cytologic atypia, and with and without stromal invasion. Ovarian-type stroma was a characteristic and requisite feature. Focal sclerotic hyalinization of the stroma was noted. This ovarian-type stroma reacted with vimentin, smooth muscle actin, progesterone, or estrogen receptors by IHC analysis. There was no specific or unique epithelial IHC. K-ras mutations by sequence analysis were wild type in all 52 cases tested. Ninety percent of patients were alive or had died without evidence of disease (average follow-up 9.5 years), irrespective of histologic appearance; 3.8% were alive with recurrent disease (average 10 years after diagnosis); and 6.2% died of disseminated disease (average 2.5 years from diagnosis). Irrespective of the histologic appearance of the epithelial component, with or without stromal invasion, pancreatic MCNs should all be considered as mucinous cystadenocarcinomas of low-grade malignant potential. Pancreatic MCNs cannot be reliably or reproducibly separated into benign, borderline, or malignant categories."

CD008054,0,10456281,0,A comprehensive analysis of selected diagnostic methods with respect to their usefulness in evaluating the biology of neoplastic cells in patients with laryngeal cancer.,"The difficult and complicated mechanism of cancer development with little knowledge about the biology of existing cancers can lead to a permanent search for new examination techniques to improve the precision of life expectancy in patients and the selection of the most efficient methods of treatment. The aim of this study was to analyze certain prognostic factors, i.e., p53, Ki67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), DNA ploidy and cell proliferating activity, as well as the degree of morphological differentiation and cell maturity evaluated on an ultrastructural level in patients with laryngeal cancers in connection with data obtained from follow-up examinations and the clinical course of the disease. Neoplastic tissue was taken from 120 patients with laryngeal cancers. All underwent surgical treatment, radiotherapy and combined treatment in the Department of Otolaryngology. Karol Marcinkowski University School of Medical Sciences, PoznaÅ, Poland, and the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Haukeland University, Bergen, Norway. Before beginning treatment all patients underwent histological verification of their neoplastic tissues. Histopathological examination proved that the majority of cases (95%) had a squamous cell carcinoma. The occurrence of changes within the lymph nodes of the neck (N) was significantly correlated with T, S, Ki67, metastases to lymph nodes, DNA ploidy, site and surgery performed. The degree of clinical progression (S) was intercorrelated with T, N, p53, Ki67, PCNA, DNA ploidy, site and laryngectomy. The occurrence of oncoprotein p53 in neoplastic cells was measured by the staining degree of their nuclei and was correlated with T, S, DNA ploidy, metastases to lymph nodes, PCNA and site. The degree of staining of neoplastic cells for the nuclear antigen Ki67 was correlated to T, N, G, S, DNA ploidy, metastases to lymph nodes and surgical treatment. The proliferative antigen PCNA in the examined population of patients was intercorrelated with T, p53, Ki67, metastases to lymph nodes and surgical treatment. The results obtained from DNA flow cytometry could be associated with N, G, p53, Ki67 and metastases to lymph nodes. On the basis of the results obtained, the techniques suggested for the morphological and biological evaluation of neoplastic cells in cancer of the larynx should include TNM classification + G + DNA + p53 + Ki67."
CD008054,0,11826489,0,[DNA flow cytometry in the prognostication of certain malignant neoformations].,"The study has been concerned with DNA ploidy and its significance for prognosis of different neoplasms. The investigation included 314 patients: primary cancer of the lung (96), head and neck (146) and large bowel (72). Patients received surgery alone or surgery plus either radiotherapy or chemotherapy; they were followed up for 6-20 months. DNA levels were assayed in resected material using an ICP-22 flow cytometer. Diploid and aneuploid cancers were detected in 20.4-53.6 and 43.6-79.6%, respectively. The recurrence rates in cases of aneuploid cancers were more than 3 times those of diploidy (21.0-43.2 and 4.5-14.5%, respectively). Overall 5-year survival in diploid patients was twice that in aneuploid ones. Similarly, survival after surgery alone, preoperative chemotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy among diploid patients was longer than in aneuploid ones. Hence, DNA ploidy examination of tumors is of great informative value in prognosing tumor process and working out individually-tailored approach to treatment."

CD008054,0,16258513,0,Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor: clinicopathological features with an emphasis on uterine cervical involvement.,"We report on the clinical and histological features of five cases of epithelioid trophoblastic tumor, with an emphasis on its involvement of the uterine cervix. All five patients were of reproductive age (median age 38.4 years) and all, except one, presented with vaginal bleeding 3 to 18 years after the most recent pregnancy. One patient presented with amenorrhea. Elevation of serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was seen in four cases. Pathologically, the tumor involved endocervix in three cases and involved uterine corpus in another two. All five tumors were invasive, nodular lesions consisting of epithelioid intermediate trophoblastic cells that were mononuclear with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, along with zones of hyaline material and necrotic debris. In three cases of cervical involvement, the neoplastic cells focally replaced endocervical surface and glandular epithelium, simulating high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Immunohistochemically, all five tumors displayed focal positivity for human placental lactogen and hCG. Positive nuclear staining of p63 was seen in all five cases. All patients received total hysterectomy and various regimes of adjuvant chemotherapy. Three patients survived the tumor with no recurrences or metastases with follow-up periods of 3, 7 and 16 years. One patient is currently alive with lung metastasis 1 month after the surgery. One patient died of tumor metastasis 8 months after the diagnosis. In summary, with its unusual ability to simulate an invasive squamous cell carcinoma and other epithelioid neoplasms, epithelioid trophoblastic tumor frequently poses a diagnostic challenge, especially when involving the uterine cervix. High index of suspicion and an awareness of elevation of serum chorionic gonadotropin are crucial in reaching a correct diagnosis."
CD008054,0,9267490,0,Flow cytometric and immunohistochemical correlations in high incidence human solid tumors.,"475 patients with carcinoma at different sites (141 colon-rectum; 102 breast; 50 stomach; 48 kidney; 46 head and neck; 41 bladder; 47 other sites) submitted to surgery have been analyzed after histopathological staging and grading, by flow cytometry (monoparametric DNA content analysis) and immunohistochemistry (p53, c-erbB-2, and PCNA expression). In breast cancer patients the presence of receptors for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PGR) has also been determined. Flow cytometry-derived parameters were DNA ploidy, fraction of cells in S-phase (SPF), and DNA content heterogeneity (multi-clonal stem cell lines with different DNA index and/or more than one subpopulations with different ploidy levels in different samples from the same tumor). Correlations of the results obtained by the different techniques have been attempted by the non-parametric Spearman's rank correlation approach. Significant associations (P < 0.05) were found between the histopathological, immunohistochemical and flow cytometric parameters considered in some anatomical regions, such as stomach (p53 vs DNA content aneuploidy and vs heterogeneity), colon-rectum (TNM vs p53 and vs heterogeneity), bladder (grading vs DNA content aneuploidy and vs heterogeneity). Tumor heterogeneity proved to be dependent on the number of tumor samples taken. The results of this preliminary assessment will subsequently be compared with the data obtained from a currently ongoing follow-up survey."
CD008054,0,20563390,0,HPV vaccine introduction at the local level in a developing country: attitudes and criteria among key actors.,"In most developing countries, HPV vaccines have been licensed but there are no national policy recommendations, nor is it clear how decisions on the introduction of this new vaccine are made. Decentralization processes in many Latin American countries favor decision-making at the local level. Through a qualitative study we explored knowledge regarding the HPV vaccine and the criteria that influence decision-making among local health actors in four regions of Colombia. We conducted a total of 14 in-depths interviews with different actors; for the analysis we performed content analysis. Results indicate that decision-making on the HPV vaccine at the local level has mainly been driven by pressure from local political actors, in a setting where there is low technical knowledge of the vaccine. This increases the risk of initiatives that may foster inequity. Local decisions and initiatives need to be strengthened technically and supported by national-level decisions, guidelines and follow-up."
CD008054,0,12525422,0,Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer.,"Of the many types of human papillomavirus (HPV), more than 30 infect the genital tract. The association between certain oncogenic (high-risk) strains of HPV and cervical cancer is well established. Although HPV is essential to the transformation of cervical epithelial cells, it is not sufficient, and a variety of cofactors and molecular events influence whether cervical cancer will develop. Early detection and treatment of precancerous lesions can prevent progression to cervical cancer. Identification of precancerous lesions has been primarily by cytologic screening of cervical cells. Cellular abnormalities, however, may be missed or may not be sufficiently distinct, and a portion of patients with borderline or mildly dyskaryotic cytomorphology will have higher-grade disease identified by subsequent colposcopy and biopsy. Sensitive and specific molecular techniques that detect HPV DNA and distinguish high-risk HPV types from low-risk HPV types have been introduced as an adjunct to cytology. Earlier detection of high-risk HPV types may improve triage, treatment, and follow-up in infected patients. Currently, the clearest role for HPV DNA testing is to improve diagnostic accuracy and limit unnecessary colposcopy in patients with borderline or mildly abnormal cytologic test results."
CD008054,0,9746693,0,Examining the Complex Relationship of Human Papillomavirus to Cervical Dysplasia and Carcinoma.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is quite common in women and is clearly the major risk factor for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer. HPV DNA has been detected in 80% to 90% of CIN 3 lesions and invasive cervical cancers. While the most common presentation is warts, or condylomata, many infections are detected only by Pap smear cytologic evidence. We still do not have a clear understanding of HPV latency, reactivation, subclinical infection without apparent disease, and the triggers or cofactors required for malignant transformation. More than 70 different strains of HPV have been identified, and specific subtypes have been associated with a greater risk of progression to dysplasia and cervical cancer. A better knowledge of the oncogenic mechanisms of HPV and improved diagnostic testing is critical to guide future therapeutic and preventive investigations. The Pap smear is used for initial screening; cytologic results suspicious for premalignancy or malignancy are subsequently evaluated by colposcopy and biopsy of suspicious lesions. Cervical cancer has been designated an AIDS-defining illness; in HIV-infected patients, the prevalence of HPV is 5 times that of the general population. Because the disease presents at a later stage in HIV-infected patients and is less responsive to treatment, close attention to timely Pap smears and appropriate follow-up is important in this population. Presently, early detection and aggressive treatment and follow-up of premalignant lesions offer the best approach to the prevention of cervical cancer."
CD008054,0,11822990,0,Human papillomavirus in cervical cancer.,"Epidemiologic studies supported by molecular technology have provided sufficient evidence of the causal role of some human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in the development of cervical cancer. The finding is consistent universally, and HPV has been proposed as the first identified necessary cause of cervical cancer. Such recognition translates into the concept that cervical cancer does not develop without persistent presence of HPV DNA. In the developed parts of the world, cytologic screening programs could benefit from the addition of HPV testing to their protocols. Controlled studies and one randomized trial have shown that HPV testing is helpful in solving the ambiguous cases generated by cytology reading. In populations where cytology programs are not functional or efficient, HPV testing is being evaluated as an alternative means of primary screening. Prevention of exposure to high-risk HPV types, either by prophylactic vaccination or by combined prophylactic and therapeutic immunologic intervention, may prove to be the most efficient and logistically feasible option for the prevention of cervical cancer in developing populations."

CD008054,0,14725728,0,Topoisomerase I inhibitors in the combined modality therapy of lung cancer.,"Locally advanced non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 30%-40% of all pulmonary malignancies. Despite the fact that the disease is confined to the chest, most patients will eventually succumb to their dis-ease. Therefore, the management of NSCLC is undergoing rapid evolution with hope of improving overall survival. The arrival of a new generation of chemotherapeutic agents, including the taxanes, gemcitabine, and topoisomerase inhibitors such as irinotecan and topotecan, offers the hope of real advances against this malignancy. Irinotecan and topotecan are camptothecin derivatives that are felt to exert their cytotoxic effects by targeting topoisomerase I. It is believed that topoisomerase I inhibitors stabilize a DNA-topoisomerase I cleavable complex, and interactions between this complex and the replication machinery may lead to cell death. There is a significant volume of in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating that these topoisomerase I inhibitors also act as radiosensitizers. Early clinical data with topotecan suggests that it is a more active agent in small-cell lung cancer than it is in NSCLC despite a common mechanism of action with irinotecan. With the increasing data that exist on the improved outcome with concurrent chemoradiation treatment for malignancies including lung cancer and head and neck cancers, there is an impetus to pursue the addition of other drugs that can radiosensitize tumors and further improve local control. Irinotecan is undergoing early clinical trials in the combined modality setting in several different disease sites. This paper will review the in vitro and in vivo data on the ability of irinotecan and topotecan to render tumors more susceptible to ionizing radiation. It will then focus on the experience with both drugs and thoracic radiation in the treatment of NSCLC, in which irinotecan has yielded acceptable toxicity results and response rates in excess of 60% in early trials. It is hoped that newer treatment strategies, such as the combination of radiation and topoisomerase I inhibitors in lung cancer, will have a significant impact on cure rates in the future."

Topotecan has modest activity in patients treated previously with ovarian and small cell lung cancer and is currently approved for use in the United States as second-line therapy in these diseases. Preliminary evidence of activity against hematological malignancies is also promising. Irinotecan is a prodrug that undergoes enzymatic conversion to the biologically active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin. It is presently the treatment of choice when used in combination with fluoropyrimidines as first-line therapy for patients with advanced colorectal cancer or as a single agent after failure of 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Encouraging preliminary results suggest that irinotecan may have an increasing role in the treatment of other solid tumors, including small and non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, and malignant gliomas. Several additional camptothecin analogues are in various stages of clinical development, including 9-aminocamptothecin, 9-nitrocamptothecin, 7-(4-methylpiperazinomethylene)-10,11-ethylenedioxy-20(S)-camptothecin, exatecan mesylate, and karenitecin. Efforts to further optimize therapeutic effectiveness through drug delivery strategies that prolong tumor exposure to these S phase-specific agents, such as improving oral bioavailability through structure modification and innovative formulation approaches, alternative parenteral dosage forms, and administration schedules, are being actively pursued. Combining camptothecins with other anticancer drugs and treatment modalities, as well as gaining a better understanding of the factors contributing to tumor sensitivity and resistance, continues to be the object of considerable interest."

In 55 cases there were free margins of the cones. Cytological diagnosis was CIN I for 8 patients, CIN II for 21 patients, CIN III for 22 patients, CIN+HPV for 6 patients. In 40 of the 57 patients suspected of having a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia on cytology and on colposcopy, the histology was confirmative. Bleeding (the most common pre and postoperative complication) was observed in 6 cases (11.7%). In three patients a new conization was necessary and in the other two patients hysterectomy was necessary. No significant differences were noted in the pregnancy outcome following either treatment in five patients."

CD008054,0,10815691,0,A cumulative case-control study of risk factor profiles for oncogenic and nononcogenic cervical human papillomavirus infections.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) play an essential role in the etiology of cervical cancer, but besides an established role for sexual transmission, little is known about other risk factors for HPV infection. Risk factors for nononcogenic, oncogenic, and HPV 16 cervical infections were investigated using a cumulative case-control approach nested in an ongoing cohort study of low income women from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. HPV DNA was detected and typed by the MY09/11 PCR protocol. Risk factor information was obtained via interviews. In a case-control analysis, we compared women who harbored infections with exclusively nononcogenic types (n = 123), exclusively oncogenic types (n = 94), and any HPV 16 (n = 60) to women remaining HPV-negative (n = 512) throughout 1 year of follow-up. A strong negative association was found between age and oncogenic infections, but not with nononcogenic infections. Oral contraceptive use was strongly and exclusively associated with oncogenic and HPV 16 infections. Markers of sexual activity were associated with all types of infections, although with varying strengths. Our results suggest some important differences in the epidemiological correlates of HPV infection according to oncogenicity that may have implications for the-planning of specific preventive strategies aiming at reduction of cervical cancer risk."
CD008054,0,11554167,0,Qualification of ASCUS. A comparison of equivocal LSIL and equivocal HSIL cervical cytology in the ASCUS LSIL Triage Study.,"Cytologic detection of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) is critical to cervical cancer prevention. Therefore, identifying ""equivocal HSIL"" (ASCUS [atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance]-H) may be useful. Accordingly, we compared findings associated with ""equivocal low-grade SIL"" (ASCUS-L), ASCUS-H, and HSIL using data from the ASCUS LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) Triage Study. The frequency of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection and underlying lesions cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or worse or CIN 3 or worse in women with ASCUS-H was intermediate between that of ASCUS-L and HSIL. Oncogenic HPV DNA was associated with 85.6% of ASCUS-H ThinPreps and 69.8% of ASCUS-H smears. Histopathologic lesions CIN 2 or worse were associated with 40.5% of ASCUS-H ThinPreps and 27.2% of ASCUS-H smears (mostly CIN 3). Nevertheless, numerically more lesions CIN 2 or worse were preceded by ASCUS-L than by ASCUS-H because ASCUS-L was more common. ASCUS-H is an uncommon interpretation that derives clinical usefulness from its high positive predictive value for lesions CIN 2 or worse."

HR-HPV DNA testing, alone or in combination with Pap smear testing, may have a role in primary screening. The screening results (VIA, VILI, Pap, and HR-HPV DNA) of 9,057 women in rural China were analyzed to determine the screening performance for the detection of CIN3+. All screening strategies had comparable AUCs (0.9). Cotesting strategies had the overall highest sensitivity for CIN3+ (99.4%), followed by HR-HPV DNA testing alone (96.3%), Pap alone (80.2%), and reflex testing (75.4%). Reflex testing had the highest specificity (96.7%), followed by Pap alone (93.3%), HR-HPV DNA testing alone (85.5%), and both cotesting strategies (LSIL: 84.8%, HSIL: 84.8%). Of the single-test strategies, HR-HPV DNA testing had a higher sensitivity (96.3% vs. 80.2%) compared with Pap testing. The specificity of the Pap test was higher (93.3% vs. 85.5%) and it had a lower percent referred for colposcopy (7.8% vs. 15.8%) than HR-HPV DNA testing. HR-HPV DNA testing with a 10.0 cutoff point (relative light units/cutoff ratio) had a sensitivity (85.2%) and specificity (90.6%) estimate comparable to Pap testing. A single-test primary screening strategy with adequate performance would permit less frequent screening and be most appropriate. Of the primary screening strategies investigated in this setting in China, the performance of HR-HPV DNA testing with an increased cutoff-point might best meet these criteria."

More than 70 different HPV types that infect genital mucosa have been found. In order to develop a sensitive and specific detection and typing assay, a PCR/direct sequencing approach was used. Two pairs of consensus primers were used for amplification of HPV DNA and the PCR products obtained were analysed by automated sequencing. Sequences were compared with those in GenBank by using the BLAST program. In this study, 2916 cytological samples were screened for HPV, as well as for triage. Nine hundred and forty-eight (32.5%) samples were positive for HPV, of which 134 harboured more than one HPV type. Of the 948 PCR-positive samples, 648 were typed. Thirty-nine different HPV types were identified by sequencing. The two most frequently found HPV types, 16 and 31, together accounted for 36.3% of the sequences (26.2 and 10.1%, respectively). This group was followed by HPV types 6 (5.7%), 18 (5.3%), 58 (4.5%), 61 (4.5%), 53 (4.4%), 42 (4.3%) and 51 (4.0%). All other types were detected at frequencies <4% and eight types were detected only once. PCR/direct sequencing is a reliable method for routine detection of HPV in cytological samples. The data presented here suggest a complex distribution of HPV types in the population tested. The results accentuate the importance of PCR-based techniques in HPV diagnosis, as hybridization-based methods can only detect a limited number of infections. This method can also be applied easily to the analysis of tissue samples and it therefore also allows type-specific follow-up of women who have been treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia."

CD008054,0,19305342,0,Adolescent gynecology.,"Given new developments in the field of adolescent reproductive health, this review focuses on highlighting new guidelines and practice patterns in evaluation and management of adolescent gynecologic problems. First, understanding the proper techniques for the initial examination is key to establishing a long-term relationship with this age group. Reservations about the first gynecologic examination are common, and the practitioner's goal is foremost to make the patient as comfortable as possible. Preventive health in this patient population is key, and practitioners should become comfortable with providing education about topics as diverse as sexuality, eating disorders, and dating violence. Furthermore, the frequency with which teenagers report sexual activity and the high unintended pregnancy rate in this age group makes counseling regarding effective contraception essential. Additionally, practitioners are encouraged to take the opportunity to discuss the availability of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine with adolescents. In 2007, adolescents were designated as a special population, given the frequency with which they acquire and clear mild HPV-related cervical dysplasia. More conservative treatment in this population is generally favored. During their transition through puberty, disorders of menstruation become the most common complaint requiring the attention of the gynecologist. Most commonly, anovulation serves as the cause behind such abnormal bleeding. Polycystic ovarian syndrome can develop in early puberty and carry its consequences into adulthood. Infertility, diabetes, and hirsutism mark the most important components of the syndrome and require age-appropriate management. Finally, the consequences of endometriosis on the future fertility of adolescents have brought early intervention to light. Recognition and prompt treatment are advocated to prevent the future implications of this disease."

CD008054,0,14746031,0,Screening for cervical cancer: new alternatives and research.,"Evidence for the clinical utility of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing has increased over the years and has now become very convincing. Some specific uses of HPV detection are a) triage of women with cytological determinations of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and related management strategies, b) as a marker for test of cure post-treatment, and c) most importantly, as an adjunct to cytology in routine cervical disease screening programs. There are many studies that support each of these applications and include 8 studies on ASC-US triage, 10 on test of cure and 13 on adjunctive or stand-alone HPV screening. The most notable investigation of ASC-US triage was ALTS, a randomized controlled trial of 3,488 women. With respect to routine HPV screening the combined studies included 77,000 women, providing as a histological endpoint more than 1,000 cases of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cancer. Testing methods were either the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) test or the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. HPV testing of women with ASC-US cytology had on average a higher sensitivity (90%) and specificity (70%) than repeating the cytological test (sensitivity 75%, specificity 60%) and was also more sensitive than colposcopy for follow-up. As an adjunct to the Papanicolaou (Pap) cytology test in routine screening, HPV DNA testing was a more sensitive indicator for prevalent high-grade CIN than either conventional or liquid cytology. A combination of HPV DNA and Papanicolaou testing had almost 100% sensitivity and negative predictive value. The specificity of the combined tests was slightly lower than the specificity of the Papanicolaou test. One ""double-negative"" HPV DNA and Papanicolaou test indicated a higher prognostic assurance against risk of future CIN 3 than three subsequent negative conventional Papanicolaou tests and may safely allow three-year or longer screening intervals for such low-risk women. It appears that HPV DNA testing is on the way to becoming a common testing strategy in cervical cancer prevention programs. Research continues into approaches for improving the performance and cost-effectiveness of HPV detection methods. Hybrid Capture 3 will offer improved HPV typing capabilities and the Rapid Capture machine allows for robot-assisted HPV DNA testing, permitting greater test throughput. PCR test improvements are expected to contribute to the growth of flexible accurate and cost-effective HPV DNA tests. It is likely that improved diagnostic technology along with HPV genotyping and quantitation may provide more value in future. A particularly promising approach is to combine HPV DNA testing with expression levels of other markers such as proliferative or cell cycle regulatory proteins to subdivide HPV-positive women into those who are at greater risk of cancer and those who can be safely followed by screening at longer intervals.

CD008054,0,16203281,0,A comparison of a prototype PCR assay and hybrid capture 2 for detection of carcinogenic human papillomavirus DNA in women with equivocal or mildly abnormal papanicolaou smears.,"We evaluated Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results for paired specimens collected at 19,187 visits from 5,026 of 5,060 women participating in the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study (ALTS). We examined the test agreement between HC2 and PCR detection for any of 13 carcinogenic human papillomavirus types targeted by HC2 and compared clinical performance of the 2 tests for detecting concurrent and follow-up cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or cancer. The k value for the 2 assays was 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.66), with 82.7% crude agreement. HC2 was more sensitive (93.6% vs 89.3%; P < .0005) but less specific (41.2% vs 48.5%; P < .0005) than PCR for detecting 2-year cumulative CIN 3 or cancer (n = 503). The presence of multiple types as detected by PCR and/or cytologic abnormality increased the likelihood of an HC2+ result. Increased sensitivity of HC2 compared with PCR was surprising, given the theoretical advantages of PCR-based methods for analytic sensitivity. Smaller amounts of material used in PCR could have limited its sensitivity, but our results demonstrate the importance of optimization and standardization of PCR-based assays for clinical applications."
CD008054,0,14746035,0,Cervical squamous and glandular intraepithelial neoplasia: identification and current management approaches.,"Certain types of human papillomaviruses (HPV) are associated with squamous intraepithelial lesions and cancer and these are termed high-risk. HPV type 16 is detected in approximately half of the high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and cancer. Because of the high rate of spontaneous regression of low-grade squamous lesions, follow-up by cytology, colposcopy and possible biopsy appears preferable. Due to the higher rate of progression to malignancy of the high-grade lesions conservative treatment is recommended. One of the most common reasons for persistence relates to the human immunodeficiency virus. Adenocarcinoma in situ is an uncommon disorder and not well identified by cytologic sampling or colposcopic inspection. The diagnosis is made by cone biopsy, the specimen having negative margins for disease. Hysterectomy is the treatment procedure of choice unless fertility is an issue. Excisional methods (particularly electrosurgical loop) can interfere with accurate histological interpretation in some cases of both squamous disease and adenocarcinoma in situ.

CD008054,0,17425678,0,Human papillomavirus genotype as a prognostic factor in carcinoma of the uterine cervix.,"The clinical implications of specific human papillomavirus (HPV) types in invasive cervical carcinomas are only now beginning to be appreciated. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical implications and prognostic value of the HPV genotype in cervical carcinomas. In this study, we employed an HPV DNA chip to detect the type-specific sequence of HPV from cervical swabs taken from women with biopsy-proven neoplastic lesions of the cervix. We divided the patients into four groups: HPV-negative, HPV-16-related, HPV-18-related, and intermediate risk type-related. Associations with clinicopathologic data (stage, histologic type, lymph node status, parametrial invasion, lymphvascular space invasion, tumor size, vaginal involvement) and overall survival were assessed. HPV DNA was detected in 81.4% of the patients, and 19.0% harbored multiple HPV variants. HPV-16-related was the predominant type and was detected in 47.4% (46/97) of the patients. The HPV-16-related types were detected more frequently in patients with squamous cell carcinomas, whereas the HPV-18-related types were more prevalent in cases of adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas (P < 0.05). Otherwise, no significant correlations were detected between the HPV genotype and any other clinicopathologic parameters. After a median follow-up of 30 months, the 5-year survival rate was lower in the HPV-18-related patients, but this difference was not found to be statistically significant, according to the results of the log-rank test. We conclude that neither the presence nor type of HPV DNA bears any prognostic significance in cases of cervical carcinoma."
CD008054,0,14746036,0,Prospects for primary prevention of cervical cancer in developing countries.,"The HPV types that cause cervical cancer are sexually transmitted, but there is little evidence that infection can be avoided by behavioural changes, such as condom use. In contrast, prophylactic vaccines against HPV infection are likely to have high efficacy. In principle, the effectiveness of HPV vaccination as a strategy for cervical cancer control can be measured either by monitoring secular trends in cervical cancer incidence or by conducting randomized trials. The former approach is unlikely to provide convincing evidence of effectiveness, since cervical cancer rates are subject to strong secular trends that are independent of intervention measures. A few phase III trials of HPV prophylactic vaccines are now being started. Such trials are very expensive studies involving frequent and complicated investigations. It is important, however, to start as soon as possible simpler trials designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of HPV vaccine in field conditions, i.e. in developing or intermediate countries which suffer the major burden of mortality from cervical cancer. Such trials may capture a difference in the most severe, and rarest, preinvasive cervical lesions (i.e., the real target of any HPV vaccine) over a prolonged follow-up (20 years at least). The design of such studies is briefly considered for two areas: Southern India and South Korea. This paper is available at: http://www.insp.mx/salud/index.html."
CD008054,0,14746039,0,Recommendations for cervical cancer screening programs in developing countries. The need for equity and technological development.,"The cervical cancer screening programs (CCSP) have not been very efficient in the developing countries. This explains the need to foster changes on policies, standards, quality control mechanisms, evaluation and integration of new screening alternatives considered as low and high cost, as well as to regulate colposcopy practices and the foundation of HPV laboratories. Cervical cancer (CC) is a disease most frequently found in poverty-stricken communities and reflecting a problem of equity at both levels gender and regional, and this, is not only due to social and economic development inequalities, but to the infrastructure and human resources necessary for primary care. For this reason, the CCSP program must be restructured, a) to primarily address unprivileged rural and urban areas; b) to foster actions aimed at ensuring extensive coverage as well as a similar quality of that coverage in every region; c) to use screening strategies in keeping with the availability of health care services. In countries with a great regional heterogeneity, a variety of screening procedures must be regulated and standardized, including a combination of assisted visual inspection, cervical cytology and HPV detection; d) regional community intervention must be set up to assess the effectiveness of using HPV detection as an strategy in addition to cervical cytology (pap smear); e) the practice of colposcopy must be regulated to prevent the use of it in healthy women at a population level, thus preventing unnecessary diagnosis and treatment which not only are expensive but also causes unnecessary anxiety to women at risk; f) the operation of those clinical laboratories using HPV as a detection strategy must likewise be accredited and regulated and g) the CCSP program for assuring health care quality should meet the expectations of its beneficiaries, and increase the knowledge in cervical cancer related matters. Finally, though a variety of clinical tests on prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against HPV are recently being developed worldwide; it will take at least from 5 to 10-years time to have them available in the market. For this reason, it will be necessary to intensify the CCSP programs. All these reasons lay emphasis on the need to reinforce actions for CCSP programs.

CD008054,0,1390300,0,DNA changes in progressive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Cervical intra-epithelial neoplasm (CIN) is treated as a progressive lesion, even though most CIN will not progress to invasive cancer if left untreated. This study focussed on DNA-cytometric analysis of cytologic smears of patients who had developed invasive cancer after initial smears showing CIN. The first part of the study aimed at describing the DNA-cytometric changes in these progressive ('malignant') CIN lesions. In the second part a cluster analysis was performed on 'malignant' CIN III lesions and CIN III lesions, with 'unknown' malignant potential. The results indicated that 'malignant' CIN lesions developed high DNA-index (DI) values during malignant transformation, as demonstrated by increasing mean DI values, a high percentage of DNA-aneuploidy and 2.5c Exceeding Rates. Furthermore, a trend-like pattern of texture feature values occurred in 'malignant' CIN lesions with increasing severity. These findings provide objective quantitative confirmation of the evolution of nuclear changes during malignant transformation. Cluster analysis showed that it was possible, using a set of four cytometric features, to subdivide the 'unknown' CIN III lesions into a cluster of lesions with feature values similar to the vast majority of the 'malignant' CIN III lesions, and a second cluster of lesions with feature values dissimilar to 'malignant' CIN III. It is argued that the profile of 'malignant' CIN has become clearer and that the results of this study may serve as a basis for a more objective cytopathologic subdivision of premalignant CIN. It may be justified to follow up patients whose lesions do not yet fit this 'malignant' profile. Not treating the non-progressive lesion group will avoid putting these patients at risk."
CD008054,0,16757611,0,Comparison of the Digene HC2 assay and the Roche AMPLICOR human papillomavirus (HPV) test for detection of high-risk HPV genotypes in cervical samples.,"Many different methods with different sensitivity and specificity have been proposed to detect the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV) in cervical samples. The HC2 is one of the most widely used. Recently, a new standardized PCR-based method, the AMPLICOR HPV test, has been introduced. Both assays recognize the same 13 HR HPV genotypes. The performances of these two commercially available assays were compared in 167 consecutive women (for a total of 168 samples) who presented at the Colposcopy Clinic either for a follow-up or for a diagnostic visit. Concordant results were found in 140/168 cervical samples (overall agreement, 83%; Cohen's kappa = 0.63). Twenty-eight samples gave discordant results: 20 were positive with the AMPLICOR HPV test and negative with the HC2 assay, and 8 were negative with the AMPLICOR HPV test and positive with the HC2 assay. The genotyping showed that no HR HPV was detected in the 8 HC2 assay-positive AMPLICOR HPV test-negative samples, while in 8/20 AMPLICOR HPV test-positive HC2 assay-negative samples, an HR HPV genotype was found. The AMPLICOR HPV test scored positive in a significantly higher percentage of subjects with normal Pap smears. All 7 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 patients scored positive with the AMPLICOR HPV test, while 2 of them scored negative with HC2. Both tests had positive results in the only patient with squamous cell carcinoma. In conclusion, this study shows that the HC2 assay and the AMPLICOR HPV test give comparable results, with both being suitable for routine use. The differences noted in some cases may suggest a different optimal clinical use."

Cervical cancer is preventable and it should be a high priority in all national cancer control programmes.

CD008054,0,15870535,0,Cytopathology update on atypical squamous cells.,"The most common abnormality reported by cervical cytology (Pap tests) is atypical squamous cells (ASC). The two subcategories are ASC of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and ASC, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H). ASCUS show morphology suspicious for a low-grade lesion, while ASC-H cells are suspicious for a high-grade process. ASCUS account for most ASC reports, and the 2002 median ASCUS reporting rates were 3.1% for conventional smears and 4.1% for liquid-based preparations. Reporting rates for squamous intraepithelial lesions and cancer (SIL+) were also higher for liquid-based preparations, and thus the median ASC/SIL+ ratio was lower for liquid-based preparations (1.27) than for conventional smears (1.44). Interobserver reproducibility for ASC is generally considered lower than for other squamous epithelial abnormalities. Women with ASCUS may be managed by human papillomavirus DNA testing, repeated cytology, or colposcopy, while women with ASC-H should generally proceed to colposcopy."
CD008054,0,12838308,0,Comparison of HPV type distribution in high-grade cervical lesions and cervical cancer: a meta-analysis.,"Particular types of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection may preferentially progress from high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) to squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (SCC). We performed a meta-analysis of published data to compare HPV type distribution in HSIL and SCC. HPV16, 18 and 45 were each more prevalent in SCC than HSIL, whereas the reverse was true for other oncogenic types including HPV31, 33, 52 and 58. These data suggest that HSILs infected with HPV16, 18 and 45 preferentially progress to SCC. This may have implications for follow-up protocols of future HPV-based cervical cancer screening programmes and for HPV vaccine trials."

The concept that HPV is a obligatory cause in cervical cancer development has lead to extensive research regarding the incorporation of HPV detection in (1) cervical cancer prevention programs, (2) triage of women with abnormal cervical scrapes in the screening program, and (3) follow-up of patients treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Epidemiological studies indicate that 50% of women becoming sexually active contract a genital HPV infection within 2 years. The lifetime risk of a genital HPV infection is estimated to be 80%, but very few of these women will develop cervical cancer. Several studies have shown that the persistence of genital HPV infections is especially related to the development of cervical cancer. As a result, HPV detection at a single moment was shown to be of limited clinical value in the triage of patients with abnormal cervical scrapes, or during follow-up after treatment for CIN. Furthermore, major variations in the sensitivity of different HPV detection methods, as well as differences in HPV detection related to the menstrual cycle, have shown that many facts regarding HPV transmission, replication, and detection need to be clarified, before HPV detection can be of clinical value."

It is likely that long-standing HIV-related immunosuppression plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of anal carcinoma; however, a direct HIV-HPV interaction has also been implicated. Using cervical cancer prevention as a paradigm, anal Pap smear screening as part of routine HIV preventive care has been proposed to detect and treat precancerous anal lesions in the hope of decreasing anal cancer rates. All HIV-positive patients with invasive cancer of the anal canal, particularly those with CD4+ cell counts greater than 200/microL and those receiving HAART, should be managed in the same manner as their HIV-negative counterparts."

CD008054,0,17354241,0,Risk of high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia based on cytology and high-risk HPV testing at baseline and at 6-months.,"Adding a test for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) to cytological screening enhances the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (>or=CIN2), but data are required that enable long-term evaluation of screening. We investigated the >or=CIN2 risk for women participating in population-based screening as a function of hrHPV and cytology testing results at baseline and at 6 months. We included 2,193 women aged 30-60 years participating in a population-based screening trial who received colposcopy or a repeat testing advice at baseline. The main endpoint was histologically confirmed >or=CIN2 diagnosed within 36 months. hrHPV testing was more sensitive than cytology for >or=CIN2 (relative sensitivity 1.4, 95%CI: 1.3-1.5; absolute sensitivity 94.1 and 68.0%, respectively). The 18-month >or=CIN2 risks in women with a hrHPV-positive smear and in women with abnormal cytology were similar (relative risk 0.9, 95%CI: 0.8-1.1). Women with HPV16 and/or HPV18 had a higher >or=CIN2 risk than other hrHPV-positive women irrespective of the cytological grade. Repeat testing showed that both cytological regression and viral clearance were strongly associated with a decrease in >or=CIN2 risk. Notably, women who had a double negative repeat test at 6 months had a >or=CIN2 risk of only 0.2% (95%CI: 0.0-1.1) and hrHPV-negative women with baseline borderline or mild dyskaryosis and normal cytology at 6 months had a >or=CIN2 risk of 0% (95%CI: 0.0-0.8). Using hrHPV and/or cytology testing, risk of >or=CIN2 can be assessed more accurately by repeat testing than single visit testing. Hence, when hrHPV testing is implemented, patient management with repeat testing is a promising strategy to control the number of referrals for colposcopy."

Significantly increased SIRs were observed for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS, 1749-fold higher than the general population), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL, 352), and invasive cervical cancer (22). SIR was significantly elevated also for cancer of the anus (34), lung cancer (2.4), brain tumours (4.4), Hodgkin's disease (16), and leukaemias (5.3). The majority of lung and brain cancers were not histologically confirmed, and the possibility of misclassification with KS or NHL cannot be ruled out. The SIR for all non-AIDS-defining cancers was 2.2 in men and 2.5 in women. Intravenous drug users showed significantly more elevated SIRs for lung cancer (9.4), and brain tumours (6.7) than other transmission categories (SIR=1.4 and 2.3, respectively).

The material in this study comprises samples from 1798 women in the period 2006-2008. The HPV test was performed according to the guidelines of the Norwegian Cancer Registry. The HPV mRNA test (PreTect HPV-Proofer) detects and types 5 high-risk genotypes (16, 18, 31, 33 and 45). The HPV mRNA results were compared to cytology and then biopsy up to December 2009. Women with minor cytological cervical lesions and negative HPV test were followed with a new PAP smear after 12 months. A total of 327 women (18%) were HPV mRNA positive. Of the 1798 women with minor cytological lesions, 232 women (13%) had moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia or cancer and 144 women (8%) had severe dysplasia or cancer in biopsy. 57% of the women with a positive HPV mRNA test had moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia or cancer. 37% had severe dysplasia or cancer. The sensitivity of the HPV mRNA test to detect moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia or cancer was 81%. The specificity for moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia or cancer was 91%. The negative predictive value (NPV) of the HPV mRNA test for moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia or cancer was 97%. Of 11 women with cervical cancer, 10 were positive for HPV type 16 or 18.

Colposcopy gave a negative predictive value of 92.86% and efficiency of 87.8% for diagnosing CIN. The sensitivity of PCR and hybrid capture for detecting CIN was 83.33% and 66.67%, respectively, and the negative predictive value for diagnosing CIN2/CIN3 was 100% and 94.74%, respectively. The annual cost for 80 patients was lower when all patients with ASCUS/LSIL were referred for colposcopy than when HPV testing was performed and those with positive results were referred for colposcopy. Therefore, at present, it is financially unfeasible for the National Health System to implement HPV testing to screen patients with cytological abnormalities (ASCUS/LSIL). However, considering that large-scale use might make such methods cheaper, PCR should be the chosen method, since it is less expensive, more sensitive, and has a high negative predictive value."

CD008054,0,18310287,0,BRAF(V600E) mutation and the biology of papillary thyroid cancer.,"BRAF((V600E)) mutation is the most frequent genetic alteration in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) that are 80-90% of all thyroid cancers. We evaluated the relationship between BRAF((V600E)) and tumor, host, and environmental factors in PTCs from all geographical areas of Sicily. By PCR, BRAF((V600E)) was investigated in a series of 323 PTCs diagnosed in 2002-2005. The correlation between clinicopathological tumor, host, and environmental characteristics and the presence of BRAF((V600E)) were evaluated by both univariate and multivariate analyses. BRAF((V600E)) was found in 38.6% PTCs, with a 52% frequency in the classical PTCs and 26.4% in the tall cell variant. Univariate analysis indicated that BRAF((V600E)) was associated with greater tumor size (P=0.0048), extra-thyroid invasion (P<0.0001), and cervical lymph nodal metastases (P=0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that BRAF((V600E)) was an independent predictor of extra-thyroid invasion (P=0.0001) and cervical lymph nodal metastasis (P=0.0005). The association between BRAF((V600E)) and extra-thyroid invasion was also found in micro-PTCs (P=0.006). In 60 classical PTCs, BRAF((V600E)) was positively correlated with matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression (P=0.0047), suggesting a possible mechanism for BRAF((V600E)) effect on PTC invasiveness. No association was found between BRAF((V600E)) and patient age, gender, or iodine intake. In contrast, a strong association was found with residency in Eastern Sicily (P<0.0001 compared with Western Sicily).

CD008054,0,15000752,0,Human papillomavirus genotyping by the DNA chip in the cervical neoplasia.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is implicated as an etiologic agent in neoplasitc lesions of the cervix. In this study, we used an HPV DNA chip to detect the type-specific sequence of HPV from cervical swabs in women with biopsy- proven neoplastic lesions of the cervix. Four hundred seventy-one patients were involved and classified into four groups based on the cytopathologic diagnosis: group I (normal, n = 290), group II (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), n = 68), group III (high-grade SIL, n = 51), and group IV (invasive cervical cancer, n = 55). HPV detection rates were 17.6% (51 of 290), 73.5% (50 of 68), 92.2% (47 of 51), and 95.2% (59 of 62) in patients of group I to group IV, respectively. HPV-16 was the most frequent type (21.8%) in all specimens tested, and significantly increased the prevalence by advancing the grade of the cervical lesions (P < 0.01). The next frequent virus types were HPV-18 and HPV-58. The prevalence of multiple HPV infections was 37.3, 43.7, 27.7, and 28.8%, and no significant difference was detected between each group (P > 0.05). This suggests that the HPV DNA chip is a sensitive diagnostic tool for the detection of HPV in cervical specimens, and that it would provide more useful information on viral genotype and multiple HPV infections. Taken together, molecular biological data on HPV might be beneficial for the prevention and management of cervical neoplastic lesions."

We studied the association between humoral immune response to HPV and smoking in 191 HPV infected women prospectively. Two follow-up samples (first and last) were analysed for serum cotinine levels, IgA and IgG antibodies to HPV16 and 18, and Chlamydia trachomatis using ELISA methods. HPV DNA analyses were also performed, and HPV16/18 antibodies were detectable in 23 of 40 (57.5%) HPV DNA-positive women. We performed age-stratified analyses and found that young smokers were less likely to develop HPV16/18 antibodies than non-smokers (OR: 0.2, 95% CI 0.0-0.9). Furthermore, they had a significantly decreased tendency of maintaining constant HPV16/18 IgG antibody positivity by the end of the follow-up (OR: 0.1, 95% CI 0.0-0.8). Smoking did not affect the development of HPV antibody responses in women over 30 y of age. Our results suggest that smoking may induce impaired antibody response in HPV16/18-infected young women."

A total number of 112 patients aged 35.2+/-1.6 with morphologically proven diagnosis of CIN II and III were enrolled into the study. All 112 patients had been observed at least during 1-year follow-up period after PDT. Among them 53 patients (44.1%) were subjected to a dynamic observation for less than 2 years; 29 patients (24.1%) were under the observation for less than 3 years; 13 patients (10.8%) - for 3-4 years and 17 women - for more than 4 years. A complete response represented by the complete regression of neoplastic lesions, which was proved by the results of morphological examinations, was revealed in 104 (92.8%) of treated women. In 3 months after treatment a complete eradication of the HPV infection was proven by PCR-analysis in 47 (53.4%) from 88 patients who have been infected with HPV of a highly oncogenic strains before PDT. PDT with Photolon is an alternative approach for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia which can be recommended for women of childbearing age.

The patients were examined by PAP smears and colposcopy with or without biopsies every sixth month. Endocervical swabs were taken for culture of cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and Chlamydia trachomatis at each visit. During the follow-up period, 179 of the 530 patients (33.8%) had cervical infection and 351 (66.2%) had no coexistent cervicitis. On average, the patients with coexistent cervicitis were younger than those without cervicitis (32 +/- 7.2 years and 37.1 +/- 11.4 years, respectively; P less than 0.0001). C. Trachomatis was isolated from 95 of the 530 women (17.9%), and 19 of the patients had chlamydial cervicitis twice.

CD008054,0,15914222,0,The carcinogenicity of human papillomavirus types reflects viral evolution.,"Persistent infections with carcinogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) cause virtually all cervical cancers. Cervical HPV types (n > 40) also represent the most common sexually transmitted agents, and most infections clear in 1-2 years. The risks of persistence and neoplastic progression to cancer and its histologic precursor, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3), differ markedly by HPV type. To study type-specific HPV natural history, we conducted a 10,000-woman, population-based prospective study of HPV infections and CIN3/cancer in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. By studying large numbers of women, we wished to separate viral persistence from neoplastic progression. We observed a strong concordance of newly-revised HPV evolutionary groupings with the separate risks of persistence and progression to CIN3/cancer. HPV16 was uniquely likely both to persist and to cause neoplastic progression when it persisted, making it a remarkably powerful human carcinogen that merits separate clinical consideration. Specifically, 19.9% of HPV16-infected women were diagnosed with CIN3/cancer at enrollment or during the five-year follow-up. Other carcinogenic types, many related to HPV16, were not particularly persistent but could cause neoplastic progression, at lower rates than HPV16, if they did persist. Some low-risk types were persistent but, nevertheless, virtually never caused CIN3. Therefore, carcinogenicity is not strictly a function of persistence. Separately, we noted that the carcinogenic HPV types code for an E5 protein, whereas most low-risk types either lack a definable homologous E5 ORF and/or a translation start codon for E5. These results present several clear clues and research directions in our ongoing efforts to understand HPV carcinogenesis."

CD008054,0,16850488,1,Impact of reflex HPV testing on interpretation and management of ThinPrep Pap tests.,"HPV testing for high-risk types is the preferred method to triage women with atypical squamous cells (ASC) on ThinPrep Pap tests for management. The impact of this practice on the cytopathologists' interpretation is unknown. A significant percentage of providers at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) are not requesting reflex HPV testing. This offers a unique opportunity to examine its impact. Consecutive ThinPreps submitted to the cytology laboratory at the BIDMC for a 3-mo period were identified retrospectively. The ThinPreps were divided into those with a request for reflex HPV testing (reflex testing request group), those without such a request, and those with a request for HPV testing regardless of the diagnosis. Cytologic diagnoses, results of HPV testing and subsequent cervical biopsies within 6 mo after the ThinPrep were recorded and correlated in these cases. A total of 4,590 ThinPreps were processed during this period. 2,659 had a request for reflex HPV testing, 1,849 did not have such a request, and 82 had a request for HPV testing regardless of diagnosis. The numbers (%) of abnormal results in these three groups were 155 (5.8%), 141 (7.6%), and 22 (27%), respectively. The ASC:SIL ratios for these three groups were 1.2, 0.86, and 0.62, respectively. 38/71 (54%) women with ASC in the reflex testing request group were positive for high-risk HPV types. Of those with ASC in the reflex testing request and no request groups, 15/73 (21%) and 12/56 (21%) underwent biopsies with 2 (of 15) and 2 (of 12) showing HSIL on histology, respectively. Our study demonstrates that at our institution a request for reflex HPV testing did not significantly affect cytopathologists' interpretation of ThinPreps. Furthermore, HPV testing did not seem to have influenced the subsequent management of women with ASC diagnosis."
CD008054,0,18051708,0,[Modern prevention strategies of cervical cancer].,"Cervical cancer is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract. Its incidence is still increasing with lower average onset age. Mass screening should be above prevention and treatment, and three screening programs, including the optimal program, the general program, and the basic program, are currently adopted in China. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) , a precancerous lesion, can be confirmed by the combined use of cytology, colposcopy, and histology and then managed with standardized approach. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is an essential factor during the development of cervical cancer, and persistent infection of high-risk HPVs may lead to CIN and subsequently develop to cervical cancer. High-risk HPV detection can be used for screening, differentiation of the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/ low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASCUS/LSIL) triage, and follow-up after treatment. The modern strategy of HPV infection is ""to treat the disease, CIN, means to treat the virus, HPV"". The licensing of HPV vaccine is an important event in cancer prevention, and this vaccine can be used for the primary prevention. However, early diagnosis and early treatment are still the most basic strategies for cervical cancer prevention and treatment."

Original diagnoses based on colposcopy-guided biopsies were compared with those made by the reviewers who had access to all clinical histologic samples (including postsurgical). Cases downgraded from CIN 2+ by the reviewers were considered indicative of unnecessary treatments. The analyses are presented according to the molecular (high-risk human papillomavirus [HPV]) and/or cytologic diagnosis used to refer the women for colposcopy. We reviewed 812 CIN 1 and 364 CIN 2 + diagnoses. The specificity of colposcopy-guided biopsy was 98% and the sensitivity, 84%. The probability of unnecessary treatment was 27% for women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance cytologic findings and 8% for women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse, 10% for HPV+ and positive cytologic findings, and 16% for HPV+ alone. The positive predictive value of the first-level screening test was inversely associated with probability of a histologic false-positive result (P = .015). In screening, a low positive predictive value of the colposcopy-referring test may result in unnecessary treatments."

The VLPs are noninfectious, containing no DNA, and are highly immunogenic, inducing high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the particular HPV types when administered to animals or humans. Quadrivalent HPV vaccine is indicated for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), cervical cancer and external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to certain oncogenic or specific HPV types. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, quadrivalent HPV vaccine administered as three doses over 6 months provided high-level protection against infection or disease caused by the vaccine HPV types over 2-4 years of follow-up in females aged 15-45 years who were naive to the vaccine HPV types. A degree of cross-protection against certain other non-vaccine high-risk HPV types was also observed. The vaccine is not effective against current infection with a vaccine HPV type. Girls or women with current infection with one or more of the vaccine HPV types gained protection from infection or disease caused by the remaining vaccine HPV types and they were also protected against reinfection with the same HPV type after clearance of an infection caused by a vaccine HPV type. High seroconversion rates and high levels of anti-HPV antibodies were observed in all vaccinated individuals of all age ranges from 9 to 45 years. No correlation was found between antibody levels and protective efficacy of the vaccine. Rechallenge with quadrivalent HPV vaccine produced a potent anamnestic humoral immune response. The vaccine is generally well tolerated and is projected to be cost effective in most pharmacoeconomic models. Therefore, quadrivalent HPV vaccine offers an effective means, in combination with screening programmes, to substantially reduce the burden of HPV-related precancerous lesions and cancer, particularly cervical cancer, as well as anogenital warts."
CD008054,0,9626513,0,Cytologic correlates of papillary immature metaplasia (immature condyloma) of the cervix.,"Papillary immature metaplasia (PIM) of the cervix (immature condyloma) is a variant of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). It is frequently associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11. The purpose of this study was to characterize the cytologic changes associated with this lesion. We analyzed 10 cases of PIM from our files and reviewed the Papanicolaou smears taken proximate to the time of the biopsy. Four cases had either reactive epithelial changes (2 cases) or cytologic findings typical of low-grade SIL, with koilocytosis (2 cases). Six cases displayed a spectrum of metaplastic cells with varying maturation that ranged from atypical reactive cells to atypical immature metaplastic cells. Binucleation was common. Some cells exhibited features characteristic of SIL, although the degree of nuclear atypia generally was less than that associated with high-grade SIL. Papanicolaou smears from all cases were interpreted as atypical (ASCUS) metaplasia or low-grade SIL. Follow-up biopsy in one case revealed a PIM in association with a high-grade SIL, the latter undiagnosed by smear alone. PIM is a distinct histologic entity that can present with a spectrum of cytologic findings. Its recognition histologically can resolve some cytologic/histologic discrepancies. Confusion with an immature HSIL or atypical immature metaplasia can occur in some instances and the diagnosis of PIM by cytology alone is not recommended, unless the diagnosis is qualified."

We provide an update on the efficacy of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine against high-grade cervical, vaginal, and vulvar lesions based on end-of-study data from three clinical trials. Additionally, we stratify vaccine efficacy by several baseline characteristics, including age, smoking status, and Papanicolaou (Pap) test results. A total of 18,174 females ages 16 to 26 years were randomized and allocated into one of three clinical trials (protocols 007, 013, and 015). Vaccine or placebo was given at baseline, month 2, and month 6. Pap testing was conducted at regular intervals. Cervical and anogenital swabs were collected for HPV DNA testing. Examination for the presence of vulvar and vaginal lesions was also done. Endpoints included high-grade cervical, vulvar, or vaginal lesions (CIN 2/3, VIN 2/3, or VaIN 2/3). Mean follow-up time was 42 months post dose 1. Vaccine efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related high-grade cervical lesions in the per-protocol and intention-to-treat populations was 98.2% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 93.3-99.8] and 51.5% (95% CI, 40.6-60.6), respectively. Vaccine efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related high-grade vulvar and vaginal lesions in the per-protocol and intention-to-treat populations was 100.0% (95% CI, 82.6-100.0) and 79.0% (95% CI, 56.4-91.0), respectively. Efficacy in the intention-to-treat population tended to be lower in older women, women with more partners, and women with abnormal Pap test results. The efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine against high-grade cervical and external anogenital neoplasia remains high through 42 months post vaccination."

CD008054,0,12935387,0,Detection of human papillomavirus DNA in self-administered vaginal swabs as compared to cervical swabs.,"The primary risk factor for cervical cancer is infection with high-risk genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV). This study compared HPV DNA detection between cervical swabs (CX) and self-administered vaginal swabs (SV). Phase I participants were 199 women chosen from a study comparing the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis from various anogenital sites. Phase II participants were 135 women from either the Colposcopy or HIV Outpatient Clinic. HPV DNA testing was performed using polymerase chain reaction and Roche reverse line blot hybridization. In Phase I samples, more CX samples amplified and more HPV genotypes (P < 0.05) were detected in CX. Genotype 52 were seen more in the cervix, whereas genotype 82 (MM4) was detected solely in the vagina. The presence of high-risk HPV genotypes in the cervix was a predictor of an abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smear. In Phase II samples, CX samples amplified more, but similar rates of HPV genotypes were seen in SV and CX samples. Higher concordance rates of high-risk genotypes were seen in Phase II compared to Phase I samples. Phase II demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing SV sampling to reflect cervical status. If validated, a self-vaginal swab method to detect cervical HPV DNA status could be utilized to triage women with indeterminate Pap smears and be a useful method to collect epidemiological data from large populations."

CD008054,0,18240976,0,Human papillomavirus-related content in state and tribal comprehensive cancer control plans.,"Oncogenic types of the human papillomavirus (HPV) are firmly established as etiological agents for most premalignant and malignant epithelial lesions of the cervical mucosa. Genital infection with HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States. Although most women infected with the virus become HPV negative within 2 years, women with persistent high-risk HPV infections are at greatest risk for developing cervical cancer. Since the development of the Papanicolau (Pap) test more than 60 years ago to screen for cervical cancer, technological advances have occurred in cervical cytology screening and HPV vaccine research. For example, in 2001, high-risk HPV DNA testing was recommended for the management of women whose Pap smears (collected by a liquid-based method) reveal atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration licensed a quadrivalent HPV vaccine for females aged 9-26 years to prevent cervical cancer, precancerous lesions, and genital warts associated with HPV types in the vaccine. New and emerging technologies in cancer diagnosis, management, and prevention are often addressed in comprehensive cancer control (CCC) plans developed by states, tribes, and territories. CCC is a collaborative process through which a community and its partners pool resources to reduce the burden of cancer. To assess whether CCC plans include HPV-related content, particularly regarding cervical cancer screening and prevention, we reviewed the most current plans available between October 2006 and January 2007 on an interactive Internet site for CCC programs (n = 53). This paper describes the contexts in which HPV-related content occurs in the plans."

Cervical swabs obtained during the initial colposcopic examination were analyzed for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, and these results were correlated with the follow-up examinations. Human papillomavirus DNA was detected by dot-blot hybridization in 31 of 109 (28%) cases. The rate of subsequent biopsy-proved squamous intraepithelial lesion was 17 of 31 (55%) for the HPV-positive group compared with 9 of 78 (11%) for the HPV-negative group. The HPV-DNA detection rate by polymerase chain reaction was 46 of 109 (42%), with a rate of subsequent squamous intraepithelial lesion of 18 of 46 (39%) for the HPV-positive group, compared with 8 of 63 (13%) for the HPV-negative group. Most women had no evidence of squamous intraepithelial lesions on follow-up if the concurrent Papanicolaou smear was normal, even when HPV DNA was detected, suggesting that HPV detection per se does not necessarily correlate with subsequent squamous intraepithelial lesion."
CD008054,0,9190972,0,Microinvasive carcinoma of the uterine cervix: histological findings on cone specimens related to residual neoplasia on hysterectomy.,"The treatment of cervical microinvasive carcinoma is controversial. Hysterectomy is performed in almost all cases, associated or not with more radical procedures. Currently, there is a tendency to adopt conservative management to treat patients with early invasion, as long as it can be assured that the whole lesion has been removed. The aim of this study was to establish which histological information should be obtained from the cones that would give the best possible assurance of absence of residual neoplasia in the patient. This was done by comparing cone and hysterectomy specimens from each patient. One hundred sixty-three cases, treated from 1967 to 1994, underwent simple or radical hysterectomy following cone biopsy. We evaluated the following histological features in the cones: (i) invasion depth, (ii) lateral extension of the lesion, (iii) unifocal or extensive lesion, (iv) vascular invasion, (v) morphological signs of HPV infection, and (vi) free or involved cone surgical margins. Residual neoplasia in the hysterectomy was more frequent when the margins of the cone were involved by atypical epithelium, and in cases with signs of HPV infection. However, according to statistical analysis, these two variables were not mutually independent, and the only important parameter to predict residual neoplasia in the hysterectomy specimens was involved surgical margins in the cone."
CD008054,0,9190973,0,The frequency of human papillomavirus detection in postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy.,"Postmenopausal women enrolled in the Iowa portion of the postmenopausal estrogen/progestin interventions randomized clinical trial (n = 105) during 1989-1991 were studied for (i) the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in this older age population (ages 45-64), and (ii) the association between hormone replacement therapies (HRTs) and changes in detection of HPV over a 2-year time period. HPV is causative in most cervical and some other genital cancers and in the presence of steroid hormones has been shown to increase neoplastic transformation by HPV in vitro. Using PCR to detect HPV DNA, the overall frequency of the virus regardless of time period was 50.3% (n = 53) with a baseline (BL) frequency of 38.1% and the second year follow-up (FU) of 22.9%. The oncogenic types HPV-16 (75.5%) and HPV-31 (20.8%) were the most commonly reported. All those with persistently detected infection (10.5%), defined as HPV+ at both BL and FU, were identified with HPV-16 or -18. Between these two time periods there were no significant differences in HPV frequency between the placebo and combined HRT groups (BL-/FU+, 21% vs 18%; BL+/FU-, 71% vs 80%). While the study is based on a small sample, the findings suggest that short-term use of HRTs is not associated with an increased risk of HPV detection, but assessment of effects from long-term use is needed. The data also indicate that the frequency of HPV found in older women is higher than previously suspected but that short-term changes in HPV detected in this age group are unrelated to the development of precancerous cervical lesions."
CD008054,0,9635687,0,Papillary immature metaplasia (immature condyloma) of the cervix: a clinicopathologic analysis and comparison with papillary squamous carcinoma.,"Papillary immature metaplasia (PIM) is a variant of human papillomavirus (HPV) 6 or 11 infection. PIM resembles an immature metaplasia but has filiform papillae, variable cytological atypia, and, frequently, extension into the endocervical canal. Because the unusual morphology and presentation of PIM may cause confusion between this and other benign and malignant papillary neoplasms, we conducted a clinicopathologic analysis of PIM and compared expression of Ki-67 between PIM, condyloma, and papillary carcinoma. Data on patient age, duration of the lesions, and procedures, including cone biopsy, were obtained. The distribution and intensity of staining for Ki-67 in the epithelium was recorded and compared with both condyloma and papillary carcinoma. HPV typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length pleomorphism analysis (RFLP). Ten of 13 PIMs were HPV 6/11 positive. Three cases contained areas closely resembling condyloma. Eleven cone biopsies were performed on nine cases. Three were found to have a coexisting high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion that was either HPV 6/11 negative or contained another HPV type. All PIMs displayed variable staining for Ki-67 with a low index of staining in the mid and upper epithelial layers. In contrast, areas of condyloma had significantly stronger staining in areas with viral cytopathic effect (koilocytosis). Six papillary carcinomas were analyzed and displayed moderate to diffuse staining, including staining of the superficial cell nuclei. PIM is a distinct pathological subset of cervical condyloma that frequently is managed by cone biopsy and may persist. The marked reduction in Ki-67 staining in superficial cell layers distinguishes PIM from some condylomata and most HSILs and papillary carcinomas. Immunostaining thus may be helpful in distinguishing PIM from papillary carcinoma, although the differentiation of the two is best made on morphological grounds."

CD008054,0,18550472,0,Can HPV-16 genotyping provide a benchmark for cervical biopsy specimen interpretation?,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) detection is an objective quality assurance benchmark for cervical cytology. There is no comparable metric for cervical biopsies despite biopsies having similar interobserver variability. Because HPV-16 positivity increases with the severity of cervical abnormality, we explored whether HPV-16 detection might be a useful metric for distinguishing a diagnosis of less than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 from CIN 2 or worse (representing the clinical threshold for treatment). By using Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance-Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study data, we compared biopsy diagnoses of the 10 clinical center (CC) pathologists with the quality control (QC) group. Although the percentage of HPV-16 correlated with severity of diagnoses, there was great variability between the rates for each individual CC pathologist. Agreement between individual CC pathologists and the QC group on the percentage of CIN 2 or worse containing HPV-16 correlated weakly with agreement on whether the diagnosis was less than CIN 2 or CIN 2 or worse. Thus the HPV-16 fraction was not found to be broadly useful as a quality assurance metric for biopsy diagnosis in this analysis."

CD008054,0,15645423,1,Predicting CIN2+ when detecting HPV mRNA and DNA by PreTect HPV-proofer and consensus PCR: A 2-year follow-up of women with ASCUS or LSIL Pap smear.,"It has been suggested that human papillomavirus (HPV) testing improves follow-up of atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) in cervical cancer screening programs. To evaluate the prognostic value of including HPV testing as an adjunct to cytology, we carried out a 2-year follow-up study of 77 women with ASCUS or LSIL Papanicolaou (Pap) smear in the Norwegian Cervical Cancer Screening Program (NCCSP) for detection of histological cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2+. The study includes a comparison between viral mRNA and DNA detection. PreTect HPV-Proofer was used for HPV E6/E7 mRNA detection from the 5 high-risk types 16, 18, 31, 33 and 45, and Gp5+/6+ consensus PCR was used for HPV DNA detection. Twice as many women were positive for HPV DNA (54.6%) than for HPV mRNA (23.4%). PreTect HPV-Proofer and consensus PCR had a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 42.1-99.6) for detecting CIN2+ during follow-up. The specificity was significantly higher for PreTect HPV-Proofer, 84.9% (95% CI = 73.9-92.5), than for consensus PCR, 50.0% (95% CI = 37.4-62.6). PreTect HPV-Proofer positive women were 69.8 times (95% CI = 4.3-1137.3) more likely to be diagnosed with CIN2+ within 2 years than PreTect HPV-Proofer negative women. Consensus PCR-positive women were 5.7 times (95% CI = 0.6-52.0) more likely to be diagnosed with CIN2+ within 2 years than PCR-negative women. With equal sensitivity and higher specificity than consensus PCR, the PreTect HPV-Proofer might offer an improvement for the triage of women with ASCUS or LSIL Pap smear."

In 380 patients (67%), the second Pap smear corresponded to the first one. In 13% of the patients, the cytological lesions were worse (particularly in 2% of the patients staging increased from HPV-associated reactive cellular changes to CIN II, or from CIN I to CIN III), and in 20% slighter than the initial. In 79% of the cases revealing more serious lesions in the second smear, the histological result of the biopsy corresponded to that of the initial smear. Conclusively, only 2% seem to benefit from a second repeat Pap smear during referral colposcopy."

CD008054,0,10388315,0,[Loss of heterozygosity of 3p21 and 9p21 in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and its prognostic implication].,"To examine whether genetic factors influence the prognosis of cancer patients, several microsatellite markers were used to determine the allelic loss of certain areas of the genome. Three microsatellite markers, D3S1067, IFNA and D9S171 were used to study the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 3p21 and 9p21 in 93 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Of 57 informative cases, LOH was detected in 27 of 57 (47%) DNA samples obtained from cancer specimens when at least one marker was used. The frequency of LOH was not correlated with the clinical factors. However, the frequency of LOH was significantly higher in the recurrent cases than in the non-recurrent cases, and patients with 3p21 and/or 9p21 LOH tended to survive for a shorter period of time. These results suggested that the allelic loss at 3p21 and/or 9p21 could be correlated with the prognosis of the patients, and that it was a novel prognostic factor independent of other clinical factors concerning head and neck cancers. LOH at 3p21 and/or 9p21 may help to identify head and neck cancer patients with a poor prognosis, who need an intensive postoperative follow-up protocol, or who are suitable for novel investigational therapeutic approaches."

The Swedish Family-Cancer Database, which contains reliable data on cancer incidence and nuclear family linkages for all residents of Sweden between 1958 and 2004, was used to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals for offspring site-specific cancer risks according to site-specific cancer in sibling and parental probands. Offspring cancer risk was significantly increased when either a sibling or parent was affected at the same site for penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, SIR = 7.54), cervical adenocarcinoma (AC, SIR = 2.31), vulvar SCC (SIR = 2.27), skin SCC (SIR = 2.14), rectal AC (SIR = 1.86), in situ cervical SCC (SIR = 1.80), invasive cervical SCC (SIR = 1.77) and upper aerodigestive tract SCC (SIR = 1.57). Significant aggregation on the order of 2-fold between anogenital cancers at different sites or histologies was also observed. In situ cervical SCC risk in offspring was strongly influenced by siblings affected with oropharyngeal SCC (SIR = 3.17) and tonsillar SCC (SIR = 1.84). Familial skin SCC was largely unassociated with anogenital or upper aerodigestive tract cancer risk in offspring. These data suggest that common host factors exist among individuals affected with anogenital and upper aerodigestive tract cancers."

Three different HPV DNA tests (GP5+/6+ general primer PCR (using either AmpliTaq or AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase), Amplicor PCR and Hybrid Capture II were evaluated using baseline samples from women who on follow-up developed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CINII+) (n = 197) as well as a representative subsample of the women in the cohort (n = 794). The population-based HPV prevalence, sensitivity for future cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CINII+), and absolute risk of CINII+ was 7.1%, 87.1%, and 23.2% for AmpliTaq GP5+/6+ PCR, 11.9%, 88.9%, and 11.0% for AmpliTaq Gold GP5+/6+ PCR, 15.7%, 93.4%, and 9.8% for Amplicor, 10.0%, 92.9%, and 15.3% for Amplicor with raised cut-off, and 7.8%, 79.7%, and 16.9% for Hybrid Capture II.

Until present, the assay has been compared to HPV DNA tests only in triage settings. Herein, we compare AHPV with a DNA assay (Hybrid Capture 2; HC2) and liquid-based cytology (LBC; using PreservCyt ThinPrep liquid Pap) in a screening setting (French APTIMA screening evaluation [FASE] study). Women (N = 5,006) aged 20-65 were screened by gynecologists in 17 private practices in Paris, France. One cervical specimen was collected and tested with LBC, AHPV and HC2 assays. Women were referred to colposcopy if they were ASC-US+ in LBC or HPV positive in either HPV assay. To control for verification bias, a random group (14%) with normal LBC and dually HPV negative tests underwent colposcopy. Data from 4,429 women were analyzed. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated for the three tests. AHPV and HC2 were highly sensitive for CIN2+ (92.0% and 96.7%) and CIN3+ (95.7% and 95.3%) detection and much more sensitive than LBC (69.1% for CIN2+ and 73.3% for CIN3+). Specificity of AHPV was higher than that of HC2, but similar to that of LBC (p < 0.001). Combining LBC with either HPV test slightly increased sensitivity but compromised specificity. AHPV assay is both specific and sensitive for the detection of high-grade precancerous lesions and may be considered as an option for routine cervical cancer screening for women over 20 years of age."
CD008054,0,8203204,0,Lack of detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) in transformed laryngeal keratoses by in situ hybridization (ISH) technique.,"Laryngeal keratosis (LK) is a precancerous mucosal change with a variable possibility of malignant transformation. Recent studies evidencing HPV-DNA genomes in a large series of non-malignant and malignant laryngeal lesions suggest a role of HPV in the transformation of laryngeal lesions possibly in synergistic interaction with other carcinogens. In this study, we analyzed 115 biopsy specimens from benign laryngeal lesions to evaluate the risk of malignant transformation and its relationship to degree of dysplasia and to histological features of virus cell infection. The rate of transformation of LK was 8% (9/115). Our results indicate that the risk of transformation in laryngeal keratoses without dysplasia (LKWOD) is lower than that in laryngeal keratoses with dysplasia (2.2% vs 25%, respectively) (p < 0.05). An increased risk of malignant evolution in laryngeal keratoses with dysplasia (LKWD) was also related to the degree of dysplasia (rate of transformation of 12.5, 22.2 and 36% in mild, moderate and severe dysplasia, respectively). Histological features suggesting HPV infection (koilocytic-like atypia and epithelial papillary hyperplasia) were found in 6 LK only, no case subsequently developing cancer. In both benign and transformed LK, analyzed by ISH, we failed to detect HPV genomes, suggesting a major role of others carcinogens, such as tobacco and/or alcohol, in the transformation of LK."

CD008054,0,18562963,0,Adeno-associated virus infection and cervical neoplasia: is there a protective role against human papillomavirus-related carcinogenesis?,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether adeno-associated virus (AAV) infection can be associated with a reduced risk for human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cervical neoplasia. The study was a prospective descriptive analysis of the prevalence of AAV and HPV DNA sequences in women with and without neoplastic cervical lesions. The study population consisted of 373 women aged 19-65 years old who attended the outpatient colposcopy clinic of a tertiary university center. Cytologic and colposcopic examination, as well as AAV-DNA and HPV-DNA detection and typing were performed in all individuals; biopsies (histological verification) and treatment were performed as appropriate. Women with normal Papanicolaou smear test and normal colposcopic findings served as the control group (n=280). Those with histologically proven cervical pathology were categorized into three groups: (a) women with grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1) (n=31), (b) women with grades 2 and 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2, 3) (n=45), and (c) women with invasive cervical cancer (n=17). AAV infection was confirmed in 63 (16.80%) women. AAV detection was not statistically different between HPV (-) and HPV (+) controls (P=0.06). In the disease groups, however, the prevalence of AAV was statistically significantly lower in the HPV (+) relative to the HPV (-) patients (P=0.0009, P=0.00001, and P=0.0225, for women with low-grade cervical lesions, for women with high-grade cervical lesions, and for women with cervical cancer, respectively). No difference in the prevalence of AAV DNA between HPV-positive and HPV-negative unaffected (control) women is observed. Nevertheless, our results indicate that HPV-infected individuals are less likely to develop cervical neoplasia if AAV is present, and that AAV probably demonstrates a protective role against the pathogenic consequences of HPV infection."
CD008054,0,16393675,0,Characteristics of apparently false-negative digene hybrid capture 2 high-risk HPV DNA testing.,"This study characterized cases with a negative high-risk Hybrid Capture 2 (HRHC2; Digene, Gaithersburg, MD) test result with concurrent or follow-up biopsy-confirmed high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3). From 2,306 HRHC2 tests, 10 negative results were identified with CIN 2/3 (false-negative rate, 4.5%). The majority of the patients had abnormal colposcopic findings and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) shown by concurrent cytologic examination, although with few abnormal cells. No trend was evident in the location of the dysplastic epithelium or overall lesion size. In 4 tests, the relative light units over cutoff was more than 0.4 but less than 1.0, suggesting that low quantities of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA were present in the sample. The negative predictive value for HRHC2 testing may be compromised when the copy number of the HPV DNA is low, and a negative HRHC2 test result may be falsely negative in patients with abnormal colposcopic findings or concurrent cytologic findings showing HSIL."

CD008054,0,18495212,0,Epidemiologic analysis of histologic cervical inflammation: relationship to human papillomavirus infections.,"Infections with carcinogenic human papillomaviruses, the causal agents of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer, as well as infections with noncarcinogenic human papillomaviruses, are common but typically resolve spontaneously. Effective cell-mediated immune responses are critical for human papillomavirus clearance; however, data relating cervical inflammation to the outcome of human papillomavirus infection are lacking. To investigate this topic, we performed a masked parallel review of inflammation in the stroma and epithelium of cervical biopsies (n = 564) collected from a retrospectively defined subcohort of women systematically followed up in the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study. Women in our analysis had undergone colposcopically directed enrollment biopsies diagnosed as negative or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 and had corresponding human papillomavirus polymerase chain reaction test results of negative (n = 250), positive for a single carcinogenic (n = 237), or noncarcinogenic (n = 81) type. Inflammation in cervical stroma varied with cofactors for human papillomavirus progression: current smokers showed less inflammation (odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.97), whereas current oral contraceptive users had increased inflammation (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-3.0) as did those with a self-reported 2-year history of a sexually transmitted disease (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.5). Biopsies of women with carcinogenic human papillomaviruses had greater inflammation within the epithelium (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.3) compared with human papillomavirus-negative women. Associations with human papillomavirus type-specific persistence or progression to histologic cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 were diminished among women with moderate or marked inflammation in stroma (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.99) or within epithelium (odds ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.97). These data suggest that cervical inflammation varies with human papillomavirus cofactors, type of human papillomavirus infection, and risk of persistence and progression. Additional studies are needed to confirm and extend these findings."

CD008054,0,15792948,0,The role of human telomerase catalytic subunit mRNA expression in cervical dysplasias.,"Telomerase activity and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA expression were investigated in cervical specimens and were correlated with cytologic findings and the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Telomerase activity was evaluated by the telomeric repeat protocol assay and hTERT mRNA expression was evaluated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HPV DNA was detected by PCR, as well as restriction endonuclease digestion. HPV DNA was detected in all 82 specimens with abnormal cytologic findings and in 4 of 34 normal samples. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSILs) were present in 74 of 82 specimens (90.2%) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSILs) were present in 8 of 82 (9.75%) specimens. Seven of the eight HGSIL (87.5%) and 26 of 74 LGSIL (35.1%) specimens were hTERT positive, whereas all normal specimens were hTERT mRNA negative. Telomerase activity was detected in 21 of 74 (28.4%) LGSIL/atypical squamous epithelial cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and in five of eight (62.5%) HGSIL samples. A correlation was observed among telomerase activity, hTERT mRNA expression, and high-risk HPV infection in HGSIL samples (P < 0.001). High-risk HPV infection assessment showed 75% sensitivity and 72.2% specificity for HGSILs. Telomerase activity assessment in cervical smears showed sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for HGSILs 62.5% and 96.7%, whereas specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) were 80.5% and 19.2%, respectively. hTERT mRNA expression assessment showed 87.5% sensitivity and 98.7% NPV for HGSILs, whereas specificity and PPV were 76% and 21.2%, respectively. Based on the above-described telomerase assessment values, it is suggested that the telomerase system might not be an appropriate diagnostic marker for cytology, given that the final evaluation must rely on a combination of all available test assessment data, clinical diagnosis, as well as the follow-up of all LGSIL samples that were positive for telomerase activation."

Cervical cancer is almost nonexistent in adolescents, yet human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is very common in this population. In the past 5 years there has been significant advancement in the management of HPV-related diseases in adolescents. The publication of the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology 2006 consensus guidelines has led to major changes in the prevention and management of cervical disease in adolescents. With the availability of the HPV vaccination (since 2006), it is expected that these guidelines will continue to change. The American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology guidelines now advise against HPV testing and recommend against treatment of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1. In addition, among adherent adolescents, treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 also should be deferred. These new guidelines were established to minimize the potential negative impact that treatment can have on future pregnancy outcomes, while taking advantage of the natural history of HPV in young women."

Studies were conducted with formalin-fixed biopsies of melanoma and cervical cancer by FTIR microspectroscopy (FTIR-MSP) to detect common biomarkers, which occurred in both types of cancer distinguishing them from the respective non-malignant tissues. Both types of cancer are diagnosed on skin surfaces. The spectra were analysed for changes in levels of biomolecules such as RNA, DNA, phosphates and carbohydrate (glycogen). Whereas carbohydrate levels showed a good diagnostic potential for detection of cervical cancer, this was not the case for melanoma. However, variation of the RNA/DNA ratio as measured at I(1121)/I(1020) showed similar trends between non-malignant and malignant tissues in both types of cancer.

CD008054,0,10754486,0,DNA alterations in tumor scrapes vs. biopsies of squamous-cell carcinomas of the head and neck.,"Genetic abnormalities in SCCHNs are frequent and may be useful for screening, follow-up and prognosis. A biopsy or resection generally is utilized to identify these alterations but analysis of scraped or exfoliated tumor cells has been proposed as simpler and more versatile. It is unknown how well genetic abnormalities in scrapes reflect those in the tumor. Therefore, we compared DNA alterations in tumor scrapes obtained prior to treatment with alterations in microdissected tumor biopsies. Eight primary squamous-cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHNs) were examined at 14 loci to determine loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at sites on 3p, 9p, 11p, 11q and 17p and amplification of cyclin D1 (CCND1). All biopsies contained DNA alterations, but only 3/8 scrapes contained unequivocal abnormalities; 4/8 contained subtle alterations that could not have been definitively identified without comparison to the paired biopsies. Overall, 22 alterations were detected in the biopsies: 8/22 were found unequivocally in the scrapes; 7/22 were identifiable in scrapes only after the biopsy alterations were defined and 7/22 were absent from scrapes. One LOH in scrape, but not biopsy, DNA was found. Discrepancies between scrapes and tumors tended to increase if multiple tumor samples were examined. We conclude that DNA alterations can be detected in scrapes of SCCHNs but may inaccurately reflect the tumor's complex genetic abnormalities. This may be due to contamination of scrapes with normal cells or to genetic heterogeneity within the tumor not represented in the scrape. Although examining scrapes of SCCHNs is an attractive technique, its clinical utility may have limitations."

It was designed to include all women (aged 20-49 years) in Greater Copenhagen, diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer or carcinoma in situ (CIS) from January 1985 to December 1986. They were identified from the Danish Cancer Registry. An age-stratified control group was randomly selected from the study area by means of The Danish Central Population Register. Information on risk factors was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. The study, which included 586 women with CIS, 59 women with cervical cancer, and 614 control subjects, confirmed that CIS and invasive cervical cancer share similar risk factors. Both disease entities were strongly associated with sexual and venereal factors. This applied especially to lifetime number of sexual partners and age at first episode with genital warts (proxy measure for human papillomavirus (HPV)), supporting that HPV infection in the adolescent cervix is associated with a higher risk of cervical neoplasia compared with such an infection later in life. Our results also suggested that parity, oral contraceptive use, and smoking may be important risk factors. In the second case-control study, we identified all women with one lifetime sexual partner based on the questionnaire information obtained in the first case-control study. To investigate the role of the ""male factor"", the women were invited to participate in the study together with their husband. In all, 41 case couples and 90 control couples were enrolled. Data collection included a personal interview, blood samples, and penile swabs from the males. The most significant risk determinants of cervical neoplasia were a history of genital warts in the male and non-use of condoms, emphasizing the venereal nature and pointing to HPV as an important agent. Genital warts are usually associated with the low-risk HPVs (types 6 and 11) rather than with the high-risk HPV types. However, an explanation for the observed relationship between risk of cervical neoplasia and genital warts in the woman herself and in her male partner could be, that they are more likely also to harbour the high-risk HPV types. Only 2 case husbands and no control husbands had HPV DNA detected in the penile swabs (ViraPapR, ViraTypeTM). As the number of cells in the swab always exceeded 3 x 10(4), the result may reflect shortcomings in the test kit used. From our population-based prospective cohort study of 11,088 women, we selected the prevalent cases (199 women with LSIL/HSIL(low-grade/high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia), 131 women with ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance)), and 1000 random controls (women and normal cervical cytology). At enrollment, the women were personally interviewed and had a gynecological examination including cervical swabs for HPV testing and a Pap smear. HPV DNA detection was done using polymerase-chain-reaction methods. Cervical HPV infection (especially with the high-risk types) was the out-standing risk factor for all grades of neoplasia, the association being strongest for HSIL. Women with high-risk HPV infection had a nearly 33-fold increased risk of HSIL compared to HPV-negative women. Possible risk factors for cervical neoplasia in HPV-positive women included smoking, non-use of barrier contraceptives and parity. If analysis was restricted to histologically confirmed high-grade lesions, the proportion of cases that could be attributed to HPV infections was 80%. The importance and urgent need for studies which include HPV as an adjunct to cervical cytology is emphasized. Greater effort should be made to determine the usefulness of this modality (HPV diagnostics) in cervical cancer screening or in the management of cervical neoplasia, especially ASCUS and LSIL."

CD008054,0,1727663,0,DNA level and stereologic estimates of nuclear volume in squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix. A comparative study with analysis of prognostic impact.,"Grading of malignancy in squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix is based on qualitative, morphologic examination and suffers from poor reproducibility. Using modern stereology, unbiased estimates of the three-dimensional, volume-weighted mean nuclear volume (nuclear vv), were obtained in pretreatment biopsies from 51 patients treated for cervical cancer in clinical Stages I through III (mean age of 56 years, follow-up period greater than 5 years). In addition, conventional, two-dimensional morphometric estimates of nuclear and mitotic features were obtained. DNA indices (DI) were estimated by flow cytometry. Finally, the semiquantitative malignancy grade score value (MGS) was determined according to previously published methods. Estimates of nuclear vv were on average increased in euploid lesions (2P = 0.01), but the overall relationship between nuclear vv and DI was poor. Different clinical stages of disease did not differ with regard to nuclear vv (2P = 0.99) and DI (2P = 0.56). No relationship was disclosed between MGS and nuclear vv (2P = 0.85). Single-factor analysis showed prognostic impact of clinical stage of disease (2P = 0.0001) and DI (2P = 0.04), whereas estimates of nuclear vv were only of marginal prognostic significance (2P = 0.07). However, Cox multivariate regression analysis showed independent prognostic value of patient age and nuclear vv along with clinical stage and DI. All other investigated variables were rejected from the model. A prognostic index with highly distinguishing capacity between prognostically poor and favorable cases was constructed (2P = 1.9 x 10(-7)). It is concluded that realistic estimates of nuclear volume are independent of nuclear DNA content and are of prognostic value for objective malignancy grading in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix."

CD008054,0,19335024,0,Epithelioid sarcoma of the parotid gland of a child.,"Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare soft-tissue tumor that usually occurs in young adults, with a median age of 26 years. This malignancy has been divided into distal and proximal types. The latter is found in proximal body sites including the head and neck region. We present a rare case of parotid proximal-type epithelioid sarcoma in a 1-year-old male child; this is the 4th reported case in the literature and the youngest in a pediatric patient to date. The tumor showed prominent rhabdoid features by light microscopy. Immunohistochemical studies revealed positive staining to cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, and BAF47. Thus, while the tumor resembled a malignant rhabdoid tumor, the positive staining for BAF47 supported instead a diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma, according to our current understanding of these 2 tumor types. Also, the clinical course was not the typical aggressive behavior of a rhabdoid tumor. The patient underwent radical parotidectomy without adjuvant therapy and remained disease-free at follow-up, 14 months after surgery."

CD008054,0,17633349,0,Error reduction and risk management in cytopathology.,"Currently, tort reform is not a major priority in either the Congress of the United States or in state legislatures. Thus, it is fortunate that medical negligence claims against pathologists are relatively infrequent, at 8.3% per year per 100 insured pathologists (data from the Doctors' Company, 2000-2003). However, claims for ""missed"" cervical cytology specimens rank third, behind those for alleged misinterpretation of breast biopsies and pigmented skin lesions. The severity of cervical cytology errors is high, at almost $700,000 per claim, surpassed only by those concerning melanoma. There are common threads that appear consistently in the analysis of slides from allegedly misdiagnosed cervical cytology cases, including small-cell variants of high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (HGSIL), present in small numbers; hyperchromatic crowded cell groups; atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS); smears taken during menses; other bloody smears, particularly with degenerative features or excessive inflammation; others showing atypical repair; and unsatisfactory samples. It is important for pathologists to spend time with cytotechnologists to emphasize the patterns of abnormal smears at low microscopic magnification and those backgrounds featuring blood and inflammation which require particular attention. Managing the ""look-back"" requirement of the Clinical Laboratory Amendments of 1988 (CLIA88) is also crucial; the need to issue amended reports as a consequence of that provision is quite rare. Procedures for administrating and reporting retrospective reviews under the CLIA88 should be clearly outlined in a peer-reviewed procedure document in each laboratory. They should be reviewed and approved by risk managers or insurance carriers, and documented in such a manner that one obtains maximal protection from legal discovery. Consumer education is particularly important in maintaining laboratory performance and reducing risk from error in cytology. Periodic feedback to clinicians on the quality of their smear preparations, the use of ancillary techniques (eg, human papillomavirus testing), and discussion of reporting terminology are important. Moreover, one should stress the need for pertinent clinical history that is often required to initiate quality control measures for evaluation and reporting of cervical cytology specimens. The incidence of cervical cancer in the United States, at only 9700 new cases per year, is low, emphasizing the need for clinical vigilance, attention to unexplained symptoms and signs, and biopsies of any cervical abnormality. These and other efforts may assist in reducing the risk of litigation attached to allegedly false-negative gynecologic and nongynecologic cytology samples."

CD008054,0,19035459,0,Different outcome of invasive cervical cancer associated with high-risk versus intermediate-risk HPV genotype.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences are associated with the large majority of invasive cervical carcinoma but the role of specific genotype(s) in the outcome of the disease is still debated. To determine the viral epidemiology in the French population of patients and the prognostic value of HPV genotypes in cervical cancer, we performed a retrospective study in 515 patients treated in our Institution from 1985 to 2005. Ninety-six percent of the cases were found associated with HPV DNA whereas 4% remained HPV negative. High-risk HPV 16/18 genotypes were found in 70% of the cases. HPV 18 was more frequently associated with adenocarcinoma (40.6%) than HPV 16 (10.4%) and found in tumours developed in younger women (mean age, 45.8 years) than HPV 16 (48.3 years) or other HPV types (53.6 years). In multivariate analysis, node involvement (p < 0.0001), parametria invasion (p = 0.009), tumour size (p = 0.01) and HPV status (p = 0.02) were associated with disease-free survival (median follow-up 95 months). Disease outcome was better in tumours associated with intermediate risk HPV types (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 52, 53, 58, 59, 73) than in tumours with high oncogenic types (HPV 16, 18, 45) (p = 0.03). Node status and tumour size remained prognostic factor for overall survival. Our data show that HPV genotype is one of the biological factors associated with the outcome of cervical cancer. One third of invasive carcinoma were not associated with HPV 16/18, indicating that the screening for cervical neoplasia should be maintained after prophylactic vaccination against these HPV genotypes."
CD008054,0,20044855,0,Preventing cervical cancer in the Latina population.,"Cervical cancer causes great morbidity and mortality worldwide and in the United States. Infection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV), the etiological agent of almost all cervical cancer cases, is common among sexually active women in the United States. Over the past 5 decades, the implementation of Papanicolaou screening programs in the United States has led to a significant decrease in cervical cancer cases. However, notable disparities in the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer and cervical screening rates among Hispanics in the United States remain. If current disparities persist without intervention, the Latina population in the United States may remain at a higher risk of developing and dying from cervical cancer. We discuss disparities in cervical cancer screening, incidence, and mortality among the Latina population, as well as the barriers that may propagate these disparities. We also address how these barriers can be overcome through the coordination of outreach programs and widespread prophylactic HPV vaccination to reduce cervical cancer disparities in Latinas."

The study was conducted in a population (N=433) of women enrolled in Brazilian centres from an initial placebo-controlled study. Women were aged 15-25 years at first vaccination. During the most recent year of follow-up, approximately 7 years after initial vaccination, no cases of infection or cytohistological lesions associated with HPV-16/18 were observed in the vaccinees. Vaccine efficacy (95% confidence interval) up to 7.3 years was 94.5% (82.9, 98.9) for incident infection, 100% (55.7, 100) for 12-month persistent infection and 100% (-129.8, 100) for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+.

CD008054,0,10073701,0,Immune responses against human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 virus-like particles in a cohort study of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. II. Systemic but not local IgA responses correlate with clearance of HPV-16.,"To investigate whether there is an association between local or systemic IgG and IgA responses against human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 virus-like particles (VLP) containing L1 and L2 and the possible influence of these responses on clearance of HPV-16 and its associated lesions, cervical mucus samples from 125 patients and plasma samples from 100 patients, all participating in a non-intervention cohort study of women with abnormal cytology, were analysed. The results show that local IgG and IgA HPV-16 VLP-specific antibodies do not correlate with virus clearance. However, systemic IgG responses were more frequently detected in patients with a persistent infection (11/24) compared with patients with cleared HPV-16 infections (3/28, P = 0.006). Furthermore, the ultimate development of high-grade lesions was associated with systemic VLP-specific IgG reactivity (P = 0.026). By contrast, systemic IgA responses were correlated with virus clearance (7/28 clearance compared with 1/24 persistence patients, P = 0.06). This correlation was statistically significant when only those clearance patients who tested HPV-16 DNA-positive at more than one visit were included in the analysis (5/11 compared with 1/24, P = 0.007). As these systemic IgA responses were not accompanied by local IgA responses, the systemic IgA responses in HPV-16 clearance patients are suggested to be a by-product of a successful cellular immune response induced at the local lymph nodes, mediated by cytokines."

However, data on the correlation of HPV with clinical features and the prognosis of cervical carcinoma remain controversial. The HPV status (positivity, type, copy number) in unfixed tissue specimens of 205 primary invasive cervical carcinomas was determined by Southern blot hybridization. A correlation with comprehensive clinical and histopathologic data and long-time survival was evaluated. HPV DNA was detected in 73% of the cases; 83% of the HPV-positive tumors contained HPV 16. HPV 16 was predominant among squamous-cell carcinomas (SCC) (p = 0.05). HPV 16 copy number was higher in keratinizing tumors (p < 0.05), and elevated levels of the SCC antigen were more common in patients positive for HPV 16 (p < 0.03). No association was found between the HPV status and 8 other clinical and histopathologic variables. Multivariate analysis after a median follow-up of 73 months demonstrated longer survival for patients with lower clinical stage (p = 0.001) and keratinizing SCC (p = 0.005). Women with HPV-negative tumors had a higher risk of death (RR 1.51; p = 0.07). HPV analysis does not clearly define biologically distinct sub-sets of cervical carcinoma.

CD008054,0,8995548,0,Cervical cancer in young women in Taiwan: prognosis is independent of papillomavirus or tumor cell type.,"The objective of this study was to address the hypotheses that younger patients with cervical cancer have a uniquely worse clinical outcome and/or are more likely to have adverse tumor cell types or specific human papillomaviruses (HPV). Cases of stage Ib-IIa cervical cancer among women 35 years of age or younger (82) and over 35 (54) were analyzed and compared with respect to the following: (1) histologic type (squamous vs nonsquamous), (2) human papillomavirus (HPV) type via polymerase chain reaction, and (3) clinical parameters, including tumor size, nodal metastases, and recurrence/persistence. Patients 35 years of age or younger had a survival similar (71.2% vs 72.4%) to that of older women from the same institution. In the younger group, outcome was not correlated with the presence or absence of HPV or HPV type. Nonsquamous carcinomas, including adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma, were strongly associated with HPV18, were more prevalent in the younger group, and had a slightly higher risk of recurrence/persistence; however, these differences were not significant and 71% of the recurrences were squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, in young Taiwanese women with stage Ib-IIa cervical cancer, the majority of deaths cannot be attributed to a specific HPV type or unique tumor morphology."

The development of new methods for preparing cytologic specimens as well as many other screening techniques suggests that current practices may be modified in the near future. The implementation of these new approaches may permit more conservative management of women with self-limited lesions related to HPV exposure, improve detection of serious cancer precursors, and provide more cost-effective cervical cancer screening."

The cytologic changes associated with a smear reported to have these cells are discussed. It is apparent that the interpretation of the cellular changes defined as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance are not clear and that there is a significant variation among cytopathologists as to the cytologic changes that should be incorporated under this classification. Data are presented on the frequency of this diagnosis in our laboratory and of the follow-up findings observed in a subgroup of patients whose smears were reported to demonstrated atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. The cytologic and histopathologic changes observed with smears reported as demonstrating findings compatible with a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion are also discussed.

CD008054,0,19347305,1,Gene expression profiling in cervical cancer: identification of novel markers for disease diagnosis and therapy.,"Cervical cancer, a potentially preventable disease, remains the second most common malignancy in women worldwide. Human papillomavirus is the single most important etiological agent in cervical cancer. HPV contributes to neoplastic progression through the action of two viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, which interfere with critical cell cycle pathways, p53, and retinoblastoma. However, evidence suggests that HPV infection alone is insufficient to induce malignant changes and other host genetic variations are important in the development of cervical cancer. Advances in molecular biology and high throughput gene expression profiling technologies have heralded a new era in biomarker discovery and identification of molecular targets related to carcinogenesis. These advancements have improved our understanding of carcinogenesis and will facilitate screening, early detection, management, and personalised targeted therapy. In this chapter, we have described the use of high density microarrays to assess gene expression profiles in cervical cancer. Using this approach we have identified a number of novel genes which are differentially expressed in cervical cancer, including several genes involved in cell cycle regulation. These include p16ink4a, MCM 3 and 5, CDC6, Geminin, Cyclins A-D, TOPO2A, CDCA1, and BIRC5. We have validated expression of mRNA using real-time PCR and protein by immunohistochemistry."
CD008054,0,10905528,0,Mathematical model for the natural history of human papillomavirus infection and cervical carcinogenesis.,"The authors constructed a Markov model as part of a systematic review of cervical cytology conducted at the Duke University Evidence-based Practice Center (Durham, North Carolina) between October 1997 and September 1998. The model incorporated states for human papillomavirus infection (HPV), low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and cervical cancer stages I-IV to simulate the natural history of HPV infection in a cohort of women from ages 15 to 85 years. The age-specific incidence rate of HPV, and regression and progression rates of HPV and squamous intraepithelial lesions, were obtained from the literature. The effects of varying natural history parameters on cervical cancer incidence were evaluated by using sensitivity analysis. The base-case model resulted in a lifetime cervical cancer risk of 3.67% and a lifetime cervical cancer mortality risk of 1.26%, with a peak incidence of 81/100,000 at age 50 years. Age-specific distributions of precursors were similar to reported data. Lifetime risk of cancer was most sensitive to the incidence of HPV and the probability of rapid HPV progression to high-grade lesions (two- to threefold variations in risk). The model approximates the age-specific incidence of cervical cancer and provides a tool for evaluating the natural history of HPV infection and cervical cancer carcinogenesis as well as the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of primary and secondary prevention strategies."

Increased risk for SIL was observed for age at menarche (odds ratio (OR) = 2.2; p< 0.005), age at the first sexual intercourse (OR=2.4; p< 0.05), number of sexual partners (OR=2.7; p< 0.005) and partners' smoking history (OR=2.3-3.2; p< 0.01). Prevalence of malignant type of HPV infection in the control and SIL groups was 18.1% and 60.2%, respectively. HPV infection significantly increased risk for SIL 6.8-fold (p< 0.001). HPV-16 infection was the commonest (31 out of 62 carriers) in SIL patients and highly associated with risk. The p53 codon 72 polymorphism was not identified as a genetic risk for SIL in this study, as demonstrated in Thai cervical cancer. Therefore, to prevent cervical neoplasia or HPV infection, inclusion of knowledge on sexual behavior and effects of smoking into public health programs is important and, at the same time, a nation-wide screening scheme for cervical abnormalities including HPV-typing is a high priority in Thailand."
CD008054,0,1351129,0,Mild cervical dyskaryosis: safety of cytological surveillance.,"How best to manage women who are found on cervical screening to have mild dyskaryosis remains controversial. Cytological surveillance misses some lesions picked up by colposcopy, but colposcopy is emotionally traumatic for women, the majority of whom will have a normal result. To determine what proportion of lesions are missed by cytological surveillance, and whether any abnormalities persist after colposcopy, we studied, by means of colposcopy and biopsy, the prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and subclinical human papillomavirus infection (HPVI) in two groups of patients who had had a first smear showing mild dyskaryosis at least 24 months earlier. One group was recruited from a centre practising cytological surveillance, with colposcopy for patients showing persistent or progressive cytological abnormality. The other group all had early colposcopy and treatment. Of 214 patients recruited into the cytological surveillance group, 70 (33%) had been referred for colposcopy within 24 months. Colposcopy of the remaining 144 (after a mean interval of 27 months from presentation) revealed that 54 (38%) were disease free, 64 (44%) had HPVI/CIN1, 8 (6%) had CIN2, and 18 (12%) had CIN3. A smear at that time identified 12 of the 18 (67%) with CIN3 as needing close cytological follow-up (1 patient) or prompt referral for colposcopy (11 patients). 137 women in the early colposcopy group attended for the study colposcopy (after a mean interval of 32 months from presentation). 37% were found to have some abnormality persisting after an earlier colposcopy, but none had CIN3. Cytological surveillance of mild dyskaryosis resulted in a 12% risk of patients having a small CIN3 lesion after 2 years, but this risk was reduced to 4% by the addition of a third repeat smear 12 months after the second. With such a policy only about a third of women would require colposcopy, and the risk of missing serious underlying precancerous changes would be low."
CD008054,0,8598337,0,The use of polymerase chain reaction to detect metastatic cancer cells within lymph nodes in stage I cervical carcinoma.,"The aim of the study was to determine whether human papillomavirus (HPV) in lymph nodes is a useful marker for the risk of recurrence in patients with HPV-related cervical cancer. The polymerase chain reaction and DNA-DNA hybridization techniques were used to examine 149 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph nodes that had been resected from 24 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy for stage IB cervical carcinoma. The lymph nodes were examined for the HPV type, which in each case was found in the cervical tumor. Of 18 patients with histologically negative nodes, HPV DNA was found in a lymph node in two of 10 patients who later experienced a recurrence and in three of eight patients who were alive and well for > or = 5 years after surgery. In addition, HPV was detected in the lymph nodes of two of four patients with nodal metastases at the primary surgery; four of nine histologically positive lymph nodes in these patients contained HPV. It is concluded that detection of HPV in resected lymph nodes is probably not a useful means of identifying the cervical cancer patients who might benefit from adjuvant postoperative therapy."

As part of a longitudinal study with semiannual examinations, 268 women in Baltimore, Maryland (of whom 184 were HIV+), provided 1,426 cervicovaginal lavage specimens tested for HPV DNA by a polymerase chain reaction-based assay between 1992 and 1998. HPV positivity and time to HPV clearance according to HIV serostatus and CD4+ cell count were compared using models for correlated binary data and survival analysis. Of the 187 participants who had at least one positive measurement, the probability of subsequent HPV positivity among HIV- women and HIV+ women with CD4+ > or =200 and <200 cells/microl was 47.5%, 78.7%, and 92.9% (p < 0.001). Within-women HPV results were correlated (i.e., clustered) in each group (p < 0.01). Compared with HIV-participants, the relative incidence of HPV clearance was 0.29 and 0.10 among HIV+ women with CD4+ > or =200 and <200 cells/microl (p < 0.001). At the end of follow-up, 11 women had biopsy-confirmed CIN. The association of HIV and CIN (p = 0.014) was fully explained by repeated HPV positivity induced by HIV infection (p = 0.648). Reversal of immunosuppression following potent antiretroviral therapy must be expected to have a dramatic impact on HIV-related CIN."

CD008054,0,7849124,0,Screening for cervical abnormalities in women with anogenital warts in an STD clinic: an inappropriate use of colposcopy.,"An audit of the use of colposcopy in women with anogenital warts was performed. Fifty women attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases in a District General Hospital with anogenital warts were examined by cervical cytology and colposcopy for cervical infection by human papillomavirus (HPV) or epithelial abnormality indicating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or both. Collated results showed a high prevalence of both conditions in these 50 women; 20 (40%) had evidence of cervical infection by HPV and 11 (22%) epithelial abnormalities consistent with CIN 1 or 2. However, neither CIN 3 nor invasive disease was detected. Colposcopy in this setting was shown to be a specific but insensitive tool and its role in the routine management of women with anogenital warts at our institution is not warranted."
CD008054,0,19697324,0,Is the improved prognosis of p16 positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma dependent of the treatment modality?,"The incidence of human papilloma virus (HPV) induced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) increases in the western countries. These OPSCC show distinct molecular characteristics and are characterized by an overexpression of p16, considered a surrogate marker for HPV infection. When compared to patients with p16 negative OPSCC, patients with HPV induced p16 positive OPSCC show a significantly better prognosis, which is reported to be caused by increased radiosensitivity. The objective of the present study was to analyze the impact of p16 expression status on the prognosis of OPSCC treated by either radiotherapy (RT) or primary surgery. Results are based upon a tissue microarray (TMA) of 365 head neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) including 85 OPSCC with clinico-pathological and follow-up data. p16 positivity correlated significantly with oropharyngeal tumor localization (p < 0.001). Patients with p16 positive OPSCC exhibited a significantly better overall survival than those with p16 negative tumors (p = 0.007). In a multivariate analysis, survival benefit of patients with p16 positive OPSCC was independent of clinico-pathological parameters such as cT and cN classification and treatment modality. The improved prognosis of p16 positive OPSCC is found after RT as well as after surgery."

Eleven cases of vulvar cancer were identified, with 0.3 expected (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 40.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.0-71.7), and there were increased risks for cervical cancer (SIR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.0), anal cancer (SIR, 8.5; 95% CI, 0.9-30.5), and CIN III (SIR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.3-2.9). Risks were also elevated for non-anogenital cancers, notably lung cancer (SIR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.2-6.0). Although confounding by smoking and other factors may exist, these results support the view that condylomata acuminata are associated with an increased risk of anogenital neoplasias, particularly vulvar cancer, and emphasize that women hospitalized with these lesions should undergo thorough anal and gynecologic examinations at regular intervals."
CD008054,0,18550229,0,"Health and economic outcomes of HPV 16,18 vaccination in 72 GAVI-eligible countries.","The risk of dying from cervical cancer is disproportionately borne by women in developing countries. Two new vaccines are highly effective in preventing HPV 16,18 infection, responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancer, in girls not previously infected. The GAVI Alliance (GAVI) provides technical assistance and financial support for immunization in the world's poorest countries. Using population-based and epidemiologic data for 72 GAVI-eligible countries we estimate averted cervical cancer cases and deaths, disability-adjusted years of life (DALYs) averted and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (I$/DALY averted) associated with HPV 16,18 vaccination of young adolescent girls. In addition to vaccine coverage and efficacy, relative and absolute cancer reduction depended on underlying incidence, proportion attributable to HPV types 16 and 18, population age-structure and competing mortality. With 70% coverage, mean reduction in the lifetime risk of cancer is below 40% in some countries (e.g., Nigeria, Ghana) and above 50% in others (e.g., India, Uganda, Kenya). At I$10 per vaccinated girl (approximately $2.00 per dose assuming three doses, plus wastage, administration, program support) vaccination was cost-effective in all countries using a per capita GDP threshold; for 49 of 72 countries, the cost per DALY averted was less than I$100 and for 59 countries, it was less than I$200. Taking into account country-specific assumptions (per capita GNI, DPT3 coverage, percentage of girls who are enrolled in fifth grade) for the year of introduction, percent coverage achieved in the first year, and years to maximum coverage, a 10-year modeled scenario prevented the future deaths of approximately 2 million women vaccinated as adolescents. Despite favorable cost-effectiveness, assessment of financial costs raised concerns about affordability; as the cost per vaccinated girl was increased from I$10 to I$25 (approximately $2 to $5 per dose), the financial costs for the 10-year scenario increased from >US$ 900 million to US$ 2.25 billion. Provided high coverage of young adolescent girls is feasible, and vaccine costs are lowered, HPV 16,18 vaccination could be very cost-effective even in the poorest countries, and provide comparable value for resources to other new vaccines such as rotavirus."
CD008054,0,12850763,0,[Preneoplastic anal lesions and anal canal carcinoma].,"Anal canal cancer rate is relatively high among HIV-positive patients, particularly in homosexual men, where it is twice that of HIV-negative homosexual men. As for uterine cervix cancer, it is possible that anal canal cancer is linked to human papillomaviruses (HPV): in fact, its oncogenic serotypes are found in 60% of tumours. Most of anal mucosa in HIV-positive patients is infected by HPV. It causes Anal Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (ASTI): low grade and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, which can probably progress to invasive anal cancer. In the anal mucosa, HPV induces clinically flat condylomata. They generally are invisible and revealed only by acetic acid application. Sixty percent of seropositive gay men and 26% of seropositive women have anal ASTI. This rate is higher than in the general population. A decreasing of systemic and local immunity and so probable interactions between HPV and HIV could explain the frequency of anal ASTI among seropositive patients. Introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy does not really influence the evolution of anal dysplasia. Screening of preneoplastic lesion is possible with anal Pap smear, and when it is positive, patients must undergo high resolution anuscopy. Cost effectiveness analyses indicate that only the highest risk group (HIV-positive gay men) should have anal screening. Only high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions have to he systematically treated, low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions could he simply followed up. The best treatment of anal dysplasia is surgical excision, with careful follow-up, because of high recurrence rate among seropositive patients."
CD008054,0,11588128,0,"A randomized, double blind, Phase III trial using oral beta-carotene supplementation for women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.","To evaluate the effect of daily beta-carotene (30 mg) versus placebo over a 2-year period on cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 and 3 lesions. Human papillomavirus (HPV) typing was done to determine whether lesion regression was related to HPV. Micronutrient levels were measured to determine whether levels were predictive of regression. Variables that influence the risk of HPV infection and CIN, such as cigarette smoking and sexual behavior, were evaluated. Women were randomized to beta-carotene or placebo, with cytology and colposcopy every 3 months. Cervical biopsies were performed before treatment and after 6 and 24 months to evaluate response. Persistence of or progression to CIN 3 resulted in removal from the study, whereas treatment continued for 2 years on all others. The presence and type of HPV was determined by PCR. Response was defined as an improvement in CIN by 2 grades. Mantel-Haenszel chi(2) test was used to analyze response to treatment. Fisher's exact test was used to determine the effect of HPV and CIN grade on response Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests were used to compare micronutrient levels between groups. Twenty-one of 124 enrolled women were not randomized because they either moved, became pregnant, voluntarily withdrew, or the pathological review of their initial cervical biopsies did not confirm CIN 2 or 3. Of the remaining 103 women, 33 experienced lesion regression, 45 had persistent or progressive disease, and 25 women did not complete the study and were considered nonresponders in the final analysis. The overall regression rate (32%) was similar between treatment arms and when stratified for CIN grade. Data on 99 women with HPV typing showed that 77% were HPV-positive and 23% HPV-negative at enrollment. HPV-positive lesions were subdivided into indeterminate-, low-, and high-risk categories; the response rate was highest for women with no HPV detected (61%), lower for indeterminate/low-risk (30%), and lowest for high-risk (18%; P =.001). CIN regression was negatively correlated with retinol levels. In conclusion, beta-carotene does not enhance the regression of high-grade CIN, especially in HPV-positive subjects."
CD008054,0,11588129,0,HLA class II DR-DQ and increased risk of cervical cancer among Senegalese women.,"To examine Senegalese women to confirm and extend associations between HLA class II types and cervical cancer previously observed among African-American, Caucasian, Hispanic, and Japanese ethnic populations, 55 Senegalese women with invasive cervical carcinoma were compared with age-matched (human papillomavirus) HPV-positive (n = 83) and HPV-negative (n = 107) control women. PCR-based HPV and HLA typing methods were used. Data were analyzed using a global randomization test and conditional logistic regression. Although this study failed to confirm a previously reported association between cervical cancer and DQB1*03 alleles, the DRB1*1101-DQB1*0301 haplotype was detected more frequently among cervical carcinoma cases than among controls (adjusted odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-7.1). Furthermore, as reported by others, we observed a negative association of borderline statistical significance between DRB1*13 and cervical carcinoma (adjusted odds ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-1.1). Observations from this study confirm earlier findings of a negative association between DRB1*13 and cervical cancer and suggest that specific DRB1-DQB1 haplotype combinations, rather than individual DQB1*03 alleles, increase the risk for cervical cancer."
CD008054,0,21209723,0,"Role of brush biopsy and DNA cytometry for prevention, diagnosis, therapy, and followup care of oral cancer.","Late diagnosis resulting in late treatment and locoregional failure after surgery are the main causes of death in patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Actually, exfoliative cytology is increasingly used for early detection of oral cancer and has been the subject of intense research over the last five years. Significant advances have been made both in relation to screening and evaluation of precursor lesions. As this noninvasive procedure is well tolerated by patients, more lesions may be screened and thus more oral cancers may be found in early, curable stages. Moreover, the additional use of DNA image cytometry is a reasonable tool for the assessment of the resection margins of SCC. DNA image cytometry could help to find the appropriate treatment option for the patients. Finally, diagnostic DNA image cytometry is an accurate method and has internationally been standardized. In conclusion, DNA image cytometry has increasing impact on the prevention, diagnostic, and therapeutical considerations in head and neck SCC."
CD008054,0,17049018,0,HPV vaccination with Gardasil: a breakthrough in women's health.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) represents one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. Although infection is often self-limited, a percentage of women with HPV infection will go on to develop cervical precancerous or cancerous lesions. It is estimated that HPV16 is responsible for approximately half of all cervical cancers worldwide. Several studies have tested vaccines directed against specific HPV types, namely types 6, 11, 16 and 18. This paper reviews these studies, particularly focusing on a quadrivalent (type 6, 11, 16 and 18) HPV L1 virus-like particle vaccine under investigation in Phase III trials at present. Data indicate that this vaccine, referred to as Gardasil, can prevent precancerous cervical lesions and early in situ cervical cancers with few adverse effects, and the vaccine has been approved by the FDA for this indication. Another vaccine, HPV16 L1, directed solely against HPV16, has also been demonstrated to be effective (at present, follow-up has been for up to 48 months) in providing protection against persistent infection with this viral strain and preventing HPV16-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3, while producing minimal adverse effects in recipients. Given the lack of a pharmacological intervention that can eradicate HPV in infected individuals and the prevalence of cervical cancer secondary to HPV infection across the world, the HPV vaccine represents a significant breakthrough in women's health."
CD008054,0,20371206,0,Plasma level of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 but not that of matrix metalloproteinase-8 predicts survival in head and neck squamous cell cancer.,"Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) in tongue cancer cells has been associated with an improved prognosis. MMP-8 is inhibited by tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and elevated levels of TIMP-1 in blood have been associated with poor prognosis in many cancers. We wished to evaluate the usefulness of peripheral blood MMP-8 and TIMP-1 levels as well as the genotypes of MMP8 and TIMP1 in predicting prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Plasma concentrations of MMP-8 and TIMP-1 were analyzed in 136 HNSCC patients. MMP8 and TIMP1 genotypes were determined by analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in peripheral blood DNA. The mean follow-up time was 3.3years. We found that plasma MMP-8 level did not predict survival but that TIMP-1 level was associated with survival. The adjusted hazard ratio of death scored as a continuous variable on the log(10) scale was 23.2 (95% CI 1.88-286, P=0.01) and that of MMP-8 1.24 (95% CI 0.54-2.84, P=0.61). Immunohistochemical staining showed that TIMP-1 was expressed in vascular endothelium of tumor. TIMP-1 levels were associated with TIMP1 genotype in women but not in men. MMP8 genotype did not correlate with survival or MMP-8 level. Plasma TIMP-1 levels predict survival in HNSCC. TIMP-1 expression is genetically controlled in women. As TIMP-1 inhibits the activity of MMP-8 and it also functions as a growth factor, it may directly influence HNSCC progression."
CD008054,0,1373315,0,Cytogenetic abnormalities in an ossifying fibroma from a patient with bilateral retinoblastoma.,"Cytogenetic analysis of a cemento-ossifying fibroma from a patient with nonfamilial bilateral multicentric retinoblastoma revealed three reciprocal translocations with the karyotype 46,XY,t(1;18)(q21;q21.3),t(3;10)(p13;q22),t(6;11)(p22;p15). Routine and high-resolution cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes showed an apparently normal, 46,XY chromosome pattern with no deletion of chromosome 13. Molecular analysis demonstrated no gross differences in the retinoblastoma gene or the TP53 gene between constitutional and tumor DNA. This is the first cytogenetic analysis of a cemento-ossifying fibroma and the first report of this tumor in a retinoblastoma patient. The data may be added to the small, but growing literature on cytogenetic aberrations in benign tumors and may lend insight into genes involved in cell proliferation and neoplastic transformation."
CD008054,0,19926574,1,HPV vaccine protein L1 predicts disease outcome of high-risk HPV+ early squamous dysplastic lesions.,"Prediction of the clinical outcome of nonadvanced, early dysplastic lesions is one of the unresolved problems of cervical cancer screening programs. We examined the influence of human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 capsid protein detection in a randomized, prospective study of 187 high-risk HPV+ early dysplastic lesions during 36 to 46 months. The difference in the clinical outcome of the HPV L1- cases and the HPV L1+ cases was highly statistically significant (P < .0001) and independent of the classification of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (mild dysplasia) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion of the moderate dysplastic type. L1+ mild and moderate dysplasias, reflecting productive HPV infection, showed low malignant potential, justifying a wait-and-watch strategy to prevent overtreatment, especially in young women. L1- early dysplastic lesions, as nonproductive infections or precancerous lesions, have a high malignancy potential and close follow-up with colposcopy and histologic evaluation should be advised."

Type-specific HPV infection was assessed at 6-month intervals for HIV-positive and HIV-negative women (median follow-up, 2.5 and 2.9 years, respectively). The type-specific incidence of HPV infection was determined, and risk factors for HPV persistence were investigated by statistical methods that accounted for repeated measurements. HIV-positive women were 1.8, 2.1, and 2.7 times more likely to have high-, intermediate-, and low-risk HPV infections, respectively, compared with HIV-negative women. In multivariate analysis, high viral signal, but not viral risk category, was independently associated with persistence among HIV-positive subjects (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-2.9). Furthermore, persistence was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.5-2.3) times greater if the subject had a CD4 cell count <200 cells/microL (vs. >500 cells/microL). Thus, HIV infection and immunosuppression play an important role in modulating the natural history of HPV infection."
CD008054,0,17293921,0,Prevalence of human papillomavirus infection in the genital tract determined by hybrid capture assay.,"Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most prevalent sexually-transmitted virus worldwide. It is known to be the etiological agent of cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Consequently, there is strong motivation to evaluate HPV testing in cervical cancer screening. Recently developed, the second generation of the hybrid capture test (HCA II) is a non-radioactive, relatively rapid, hybridization assay, designed to detect 18 HPV types divided into high and low-risk groups. We evaluated 7,314 patients (5,833 women and 1,481 men) for HPV infection by HCA II. Among them, 3,008 (41.1%) presented HPV infection: 430 (14.2%) had HPV DNA of low risk for cancer, 1,631 (54.2%) had high risk HPV types and 947 (31.5%) had both types. The prevalence in females was 44.9%. The prevalence of HPV DNA in the group for which cytological results were available was slightly higher: 55.3% (1007/1824). Significant differences were detected in the frequency of HPV infection of the cervix between normal cases and those with high-grade squamous-intraepithelial lesions (HSIL)(P<0.0001). Among males, the prevalence was 26.2%, composed of 9.1% in Group A, 9.7% in Group B and 7.4% with multiple infections. We observed that male prevalence was lower and that low-risk types were more frequent than in females. HPV viral load was significantly greater in SILs than in normal or inflammatory cases (P<0.0001), suggesting an association between high viral load values and risk of SIL. Because of high costs, the HCA II test cannot be recommended for routine mass screening for cervical infection in poor countries. Nevertheless, it was found to be a useful tool, when combined with cytology, discovering high-risk infections in apparently normal tissues and revealing silent infections that may be responsible for the maintenance of HPV in the general population. These findings point to the need for close and careful management of patients, thereby reducing overtreatment, allowing analysis of both sexual partners and finally contributing to the control of genital infections associated with a risk for cancer."
CD008054,0,16526022,0,"Antitumor action of curcumin in human papillomavirus associated cells involves downregulation of viral oncogenes, prevention of NFkB and AP-1 translocation, and modulation of apoptosis.","Curcumin (diferuloyl methane), the major yellow pigment from the rhizomes of turmeric (Curcuma longa Linn), has anticancer properties. Infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) leads to development of cervical carcinoma, predominantly through the action of viral oncoproteins E6 and E7. The present study aims at analyzing the antitumor and antiviral properties of curcumin, on HPV associated cervical cancer cells. Our findings indicate curcumin to be cytotoxic to cervical cancer cells in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. The cytotoxic activity was selectively more in HPV16 and HPV18 infected cells compared to non-HPV infected cells. Balance between tumor cell proliferation and spontaneous cell death via apoptosis had an important role in regulation of tumor cell growth. Curcumin-induced apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. Morphological hallmarks of apoptosis such as nuclear fragmentation and internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA were observed. Curcumin also selectively inhibited expression of viral oncogenes E6 and E7, evident from RT-PCR and Western blotting data. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that activation of NFkappaB-induced by TNFalpha is down regulated by curcumin. Curcumin blocked IkBalpha phosphorylation and degradation, leading to abrogation of NFkappaB activation. Curcumin also down regulated the expression of COX-2, a gene regulated by NFkappaB. Binding of AP-1, an indispensable component for efficient epithelial tissue-specific gene expression of HPV was also selectively down regulated by curcumin. These results provide attractive data for the possible use of curcumin in the management of HPV associated tumors."
CD008054,0,19127262,0,Different cervical cancer screening approaches in a Chinese multicentre study.,"To evaluate alternative cervical cancer screening methods, digital colposcopy and collection of cervical exfoliated cells for liquid-based cytology (LBC) and hybrid capture 2 (HC2) testing were performed among 2562 women aged 15-59 years in three study sites in the People's Republic of China (rural Shanxi province, Shenyang city in Liaoning province and Shenzhen city in Guangdong province). Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) was also evaluated independently from colposcopy. A total of 74 cases of histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) were identified, and 16 CIN2+ cases were imputed among unbiopsied women to correct for verification bias. Corrected sensitivity for CIN2+ was 37% for VIA, 54% for colposcopy, 87% for LBC with a threshold of atypical cells of undetermined significance (LBC>or=ASCUS), 90% for HC2, 84% for LBC using HC2 to triage ASCUS and 96% for positivity to LBC>or=ASCUS or HC2. For VIA, sensitivity was much lower among women >or=40 years (12%) than those aged <or=39 years (50%). Specificity varied from 77% for positivity to LBC>or=ASCUS or HC2, up to 94% for LBC using HC2 to triage ASCUS. In conclusion, LBC, HC2 and their combinations performed well, whereas VIA missed a majority of CIN2+, particularly in older women. Digital colposcopy performed better than VIA, but still missed nearly half of CIN2+ in this study."
CD008054,0,12668281,0,Prognostic factors associated with the clinical outcome of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a cohort study in Japan.,"One hundred and eighty-five Japanese women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were enrolled in this follow-up study. On the basis of the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in Japanese cervical cancer patients, HPV types were categorized into three groups as follows: (1) high risk (types 16, 18, 33, 52, and 58), (2) intermediate risk (types 31, 35, 39, 51, 56, 59, 68, and 70), (3) low risk (type 6, 30, 42, 53, 54, 55, 66 and unclassified types). High-risk HPV infection was a risk factor for progression of the disease. The regression rate in the HPV negative group was higher (83.3%) than those in the HPV positive groups, but the differences in regression were no longer significant after adjustment for age and CIN grade. It is also noted that a lower cytomegalovirus IgG level and a smaller number of past pregnancies might be associated with the regression of CIN lesions."

CD008054,0,18174309,1,Human papillomavirus (HPV) in atypical squamous cervical cytology: the Invader HPV test as a new screening assay.,"In surveillance for cervical neoplasia, a diagnosis of cytologically atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) presents a significant clinical issue, often dependent on testing for high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) for the triage of patients. HPV type 16 now appears to be a critical concern in the follow-up of patients with ASCUS. The Invader HPV (Inv2) test, by Third Wave Technologies, Inc., is a recently developed analyte-specific reagent assay that uses probe sets for the detection of 14 HR HPV subtypes. These probe sets are A5/A6 (HPV types 51, 56, and 66), A7 (HPV types 18, 39, 45, 59, and 68), and A9 (HPV types 16, 31, 33, 35, 52, and 58). This report describes the performance characteristics of the Inv2 test in the screening of ASCUS cervical cytology specimens and correlates the results of the Inv2 test with those of the Hybrid Capture II HPV (HC2) test by Digene. The linear array HPV genotyping test (Roche Molecular Systems) was used as a reference method for the testing of samples with discordant results. Ninety-four Pap smear samples with a cytological diagnosis of ASCUS and 39 samples with a negative diagnosis were tested. The results of the Inv2 test demonstrated a good (86.6%) concordance with those of the HC2 test, with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 96% for the Inv2 test. Additionally, the Inv2 assay, which offers high-throughput, semiautomated DNA extraction, allows the subgrouping of HPV types by differential probe sets, could provide a useful test for screening for HPV, and has the potential to provide an improved means of risk stratification and the selection of patients for further HPV subtyping."
CD008054,0,10685638,0,Second primary epithelial malignancy of nasopharynx and nasal cavity after successful curative radiation therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"Patients with head and neck cancer are at high risk of developing additional second primary tumors in the aerodigestive tract as a result of the field cancerization phenomenon. In this context, the appearance of a new neoplasm often poses a problem in differential diagnosis between recurrence and new primary tumor. Twelve patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who received radiation therapy for the primary tumor and developed a second epithelial malignancy in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx during the follow-up period are presented in this report. The differentiation between the 2 entities based on the spatiotemporal relations, histological features, and the status of Epstein-Barr virus in tumor lesions are also presented. Our study showed that the epithelial malignancy after NPC having late-onset or prolonged interval (range, 5 to 18 years), different histological patterns (keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, or small cell carcinoma) distinct from the primary NPC (differentiated or undifferentiated nonkeratinizing carcinoma), and absence of Epstein-Barr virus, indicate a newly developed tumor rather than recurrent NPC. Our observations showed for the first time that second primary epithelial malignancy developed in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx years after curative therapy for NPC with a prevalence of 0.4% (12/2,794). Wild-type p53 protein was expressed more often in the original NPC (9 of 12) than in the second tumors (4 of 10), but the significance was not statistically significant (P = .2048). Genomic analysis for p53 mutation and in situ hybridization for human papillomavirus showed negative results, indicating that both important molecular events in NPC or head and neck cancer play a small role in this particular type of newly developed second malignant tumor.

CD008054,0,13679459,0,The p16 (CDKN2a/INK4a) tumor-suppressor gene in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a promoter methylation and protein expression study in 100 cases.,"The p16 (CDKN2a/INK4a) gene is an important tumor-suppressor gene, involved in the p16/cyclin-dependent kinase/retinoblastoma gene pathway of cell cycle control. The p16 protein is considered to be a negative regulator of the pathway. The gene encodes an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, which regulate the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene and the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle. In the present study, p16 gene promoter hypermethylation patterns and p16 protein expression were analyzed in 100 consecutive untreated cases of primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma by methylation-specific PCR and immunohistochemical staining. The p16 promoter hypermethylation and apparent loss of p16 protein expression were detected in 27% and 74% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. By chi(2) test, history of alcohol or tobacco use was significantly correlated with the loss of p16 protein expression (P =.005 and.05, respectively). When patient follow-up data were correlated with various clinical and molecular parameters, tumor size and nodal and clinical stage were the strongest prognostic predictors for disease-free survival (tumor recurrence) and for cause-specific and overall survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Neither p16 promoter hypermethylation nor apparent loss of p16 protein expression appears to be an independent prognostic factor, although loss of p16 protein may be used to predict overall patient survival in early-stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma."
CD008054,0,9332763,0,Immune activation in cervical neoplasia: cross-sectional association between plasma soluble interleukin 2 receptor levels and disease.,"In a previous study (Tsukui et al., Cancer Res., 56: 3967-3974, 1996), we observed an inverse association between degree of cervical neoplasia and interleukin (IL) 2 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E6 and E7 peptides in vitro. This suggested that a Th1-mediated cellular immune response might be important in host immunological control of HPV infection and that a lack of such a response might predispose to progression of cervical disease. To follow up on these findings, we have conducted a cross-sectional study of women with various degrees of cervical neoplasia to investigate the association between overall immune activation and cervical disease. A total of 235 women were recruited into our study; 120 of these women were participants in our previous study in which IL-2 production in response to HPV-16-specific peptides was measured. The study population included 34 women with invasive cancer, 62 women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), and 105 women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs). In addition, 34 cytologically normal women with no past history of squamous intraepithelial lesions despite confirmed HPV-16 infection in the 5 years preceding the study were selected as controls. As our measure of overall immune activation, serum samples obtained from study participants were tested for soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level using an ELISA method. The mean sIL-2R levels were found to increase with increasing disease severity (Ptrend = 0.0002). Among cytologically normal, HPV-exposed women, the mean receptor level in serum was 465.8 units/ml compared to 467.6 units/ml among LSIL subjects, 514.9 units/ml among HSIL subjects, and 695.5 units/ml among women with invasive cervical cancer. Similarly, the proportion of women with elevated sIL-2R levels (defined as > or = 450 units/ml) increased with increasing disease severity from 35.2% among normal study subjects to 70.6% among cancer patients (Ptrend = 0.003). Among the subgroup of subjects for whom in vitro IL-2 production in response to HPV-16-specific peptides was measured, we examined the association between in vitro IL-2 production and serum levels of sIL-2R. sIL-2R levels were higher, on average, among those women who were positive in our IL-2 production assay compared to those who were negative, but the differences did not reach statistical significance (P > 0.05). We also observed a trend of increasing sIL-2R level with increasing disease severity both in women who were positive and in women who were negative for our IL-2 production assay, but the trend was only significant among those who were negative for IL-2 production (Ptrend = 0.01). Results from our studies suggest that although the immune system of women with cervical neoplasia is nonspecifically activated as disease severity increases, the ability of those women with HSILs or cancer to mount a Th1-mediated immune response to HPV peptides appears to decrease compared to women with LSILs or normal women infected with HPV. Increased overall activation along with decreased Th1 immune response among women with increasing cervical disease severity might be explained by an increased Th2-mediated immune response, a response that we hypothesize is ineffective in controlling the viral infection and its early cytological manifestations. Future studies should directly assess Th2-mediated responses to confirm this hypothesis. Also, future efforts should be aimed at determining whether the associations observed are causally related to disease progression or an effect of the disease."

The parameters studied included stage according to FIGO, age, histopathologic grade according to Ackerman and MGS scores, DNA ploidy, S-phase fraction as well as treatment with radiation only, surgery only or a combination thereof as well as adjuvant chemotherapy. Univariate analysis showed that patients in FIGO stages IA-IIA with MGS up to 14 points survived significantly better than other groups. MGS parameter mitosis, vascular invasion and type of invasion predicted survival as did clinical stage. Diploid cases with SPF > 15% survived less than remaining other cases. Multivariate analysis not including treatment indicated that FIGO stage and diploid cases with SPF > 15% predicted survival but not total MGS score and age. When treatment for FIGO stages IA-IIA was included, elderly women had a worse prognosis. Adjuvant chemotherapy, surgical alone or radiation alone did not demonstrate any differences within groups. In Figo stages IIB-IV, cases with radiotherapy only survived significantly better than patients with other treatment schedules. The frequency of low malignancy patients (< MGS 16) in relation to year of initial diagnosis was found to have decreased between years 1967 and 1988, probably as a result of screening activities."
CD008054,0,17334454,0,The role of human papillomavirus infection in prostate cancer.,"Human papillomavirus HPV is the cause of the most common sexually transmitted diseases STDs of viral etiology worldwide. High-risk HPVs are the etiological agents of cervical and other anogenital malignancies and low-risk HPVs induce only benign genital warts. Since high-risk HPVs have been shown to possess oncogenic potential, an association between HPV infection and prostatic carcinoma Pca has been suggested. Some authors demonstrated that HPV infection play an important role in the pathogenesis of Pca. Active research is ongoing to highlight the mechanisms by which HPV involved in the development of cancer. The aim of this article is to review the studies that investigated the association between HPV and Pca and to explore the mechanism of HPV oncogenesis."
CD008054,0,15228423,0,Primary carcinoma of the vagina: factors influencing the age at diagnosis. The Radiumhemmet series 1956-96.,"The objective to this retrospective study of 341 cases of primary carcinoma of vagina (PCV) diagnosed between 1956 and 1996 was to find whether epidemiological, clinical, and histopathological variables were related to the age at diagnosis of patients with PCV. The univariate statistical analysis showed that younger age at diagnosis significantly correlated with a history of cervical dysplasia, hysterectomy, gynecological infections, and tumors located in the upper part of the vagina, whereas older age at diagnosis significantly correlated with late menarche and exophytically growing tumors. In the multivariate regression analysis, the remaining independent predictors were a history of cervical dysplasia and age at menarche. Further, parity >/=4 as well as nulliparity, smoking, and unstable marital status were more common among patients with PCV than among those in the general Swedish female population. This study indicates that the etiology of vaginal carcinoma may be age related. In young patients, the disease seems to be etiologically related to cervical neoplasia and thus human papillomavirus (HPV) dependent. However, in the most common age group, the older patients, there might be another (probably non-HPV-related) etiology associated with hormonal factors and trauma to the vagina."
CD008054,0,9563486,0,Differential T helper cell responses to human papillomavirus type 16 E7 related to viral clearance or persistence in patients with cervical neoplasia: a longitudinal study.,"T-cell-mediated immune responses against oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are believed to play a role in the prevention of cervical carcinogenesis. The in vitro production of interleukin 2 by CD4+ T helper (Th) cells in response to overlapping 20-mer peptides covering the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein sequence was determined in 72 women with cytological evidence of premalignant cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) who participated in a nonintervention follow-up (FU) study. In addition, 15 HPV-16 + cervical carcinoma patients were tested. Positive Th cell reactivity was restricted to patients infected by HPV-16 and related types and showed a strong association with viral persistence and disease progression, as evidenced by the high frequency of positive responders among women with persistent HPV-16 infections who ended FU with high-grade CIN III lesions [14 of 15 (93%)]. Women with cervical carcinoma showed responses at a significantly reduced rate [7 of 15 (47%); P = 0.014]. Over the FU period (10-34 months), the level of E7-induced interleukin 2 production from the lymphocytes of CIN patients who had cleared HPV-16 infection showed an inverse correlation with time relative to the last positive HPV DNA test, with 8 of 13 of these patients showing positive responses after clearance. By contrast, among women with persistent HPV-16 infections and developing CIN III lesions (n = 8), there was a rise in Th cell activity over the course of FU. The majority of women responded to an immunogenic region in the carboxyl terminus of the E7 protein (amino acids 67-98). The observed HPV-16 E7-specific Th cell responses may develop as a consequence of increased antigen availability resulting either from clearance or from progression of cervical lesions."

HPV 16, 31 and 33 conveyed the highest risks and were responsible for 33.1, 18.3 and 7.7% of CIN2+ cases, respectively. Women infected with HPV 18, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 66 had significantly lower risks of CIN2+ than women infected with HPV 16. After adjustment for infection with other HPV types, HPV types 35, 45, 59 and 66 had no detectable association with CIN2+. In summary, the different HPV types found in cervical cancer show distinctly different CIN2+ risks, with high risks being restricted to HPV 16 and its close relatives HPV 31 and HPV 33."

Gene therapy is a potential method of improving patient outcome. Progress in gene therapy for cancer is reviewed with emphasis on the limitations of vector technology and treatment strategies. Given the current technological vector limitations in transmitting the therapeutic genes, treatments that require the fewest number of cells to be altered by the new gene are optimal. Therefore an immune-based gene therapy strategy was selected in which the tumors were transfected with the gene for an alloantigen, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B7, a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This would restore an antigen presentation mechanism in the tumor to induce an antitumor response. This gene therapy strategy was tested in patients with advanced, unresectable head and neck cancer."
CD008054,0,16646070,0,Time to clearance of human papillomavirus infection by type and human immunodeficiency virus serostatus.,"Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is central to cervical carcinogenesis. Certain high-risk types, such as HPV16, may be more persistent than other HPV types, and type-specific HPV persistence may differ by HIV serostatus. This study evaluated the association between HPV type and clearance of HPV infections in 522 HIV-seropositive and 279 HIV-seronegative participants in the HIV Epidemiology Research Study (HERS, United States, 1993-2000). Type-specific HPV infections were detected using MY09/MY11/HMB01-based PCR and 26 HPV type-specific probes. The estimated duration of type-specific infections was measured from the first HPV-positive visit to the first of two consecutive negative visits. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for HPV clearance were calculated using Cox models adjusted for study site and risk behavior (sexual or injection drugs). A total of 1,800 HPV infections were detected in 801 women with 4.4 years median follow-up. HRs for clearance of HPV16 and related types versus low-risk HPV types were 0.79 (95% CI: 0.64-0.97) in HIV-positive women and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.59-1.27) in HIV-negative women. HRs for HPV18 versus low-risk types were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.56-1.16) and 0.57 (95% CI: 0.22-1.45) for HIV-positive and -negative women, respectively. HPV types within the high-risk category had low estimated clearance rates relative to low-risk types, but HRs were not substantially modified by HIV serostatus."

CD008054,0,12509095,0,"Management of precursor lesions of cervical carcinoma: history, host defense, and a survey of modalities.","Before the initiation of screening and treatment for cervical cancer precursors, approximately 3% to 4% of women were destined to eventually develop cervical cancer. During the last 50 years the rate of cervical cancer incidence and mortality has decreased by more than 75% primarily because of the widespread availability of cervical cytologic screening and of treatment for documented cervical precancer. Successful screening of the entire population and appropriate treatment of lesions could theoretically reduce this risk to one tenth of the risk of an unscreened population [7,28]. The relatively recent understanding of the etiology of cervical cancer precursor lesions and of the immune response to them has given new direction to management options that incorporate healthy habits and dietary measures as part of traditional ablative or excisional treatment options. As we look to the future we can expect that new markers that more specifically identify individuals at-risk for cervical precancer and cancer will be developed and take precedence in cervical screening. At the same time, treating the cause of these lesions, rather than the result, should provide less traumatic and more successful therapies. To this end, harnessing the immune system through immune response modifiers and HPV vaccines seems to be on the horizon, as do new chemopreventative approaches. Of all human cancers, only cervical cancer, once the second most common cancer among women, stands on the threshold of being virtually eliminated."

CD008054,0,16670716,0,Performance of cytology and human papillomavirus testing in relation to the menstrual cycle.,"Cervical smears prepared around the time of menses have been linked to unsatisfactory specimens and false negative results; however, it is unclear whether liquid-based cytology is similarly affected and data relating date of last menstrual period (LMP) to human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing are conflicting. Accordingly, we evaluated liquid-based cytology and HPV test results using Hybrid Capture 2 and PCR by LMP (days 0-10; 11-21; 22-28). We studied 5060 participants in ALTS, the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS) Low Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL) Triage Study. On average, women had 3.4 examinations (median 4, range 1-5) during a 2-year period of observation permitting an examination of intra-individual variation in cytology and HPV by LMP. Although uncommon, unsatisfactory cytology specimens were most likely on days 0-10. For satisfactory specimens, the frequency with which cytologic categories were reported varied by time since LMP, although differences were modest and did not affect the chance of abnormal cytology or its severity among women diagnosed with CIN2+. The frequency of positive HC2 tests did not vary with date of LMP. Among HPV infected women, independent of eventual diagnosis and the number of viral genotypes present, mid-cycle specimens yielded the highest frequency of LSIL cytologic interpretations and the highest HPV load; however, the magnitude of these effects were small. Intraindividual correlations of cytology or HPV by LMP were generally weak. We conclude that mid-cycle specimens yield slightly higher HPV DNA loads and slightly increased LSIL interpretations, but the clinical impact is marginal. Standardizing collection times would slightly improve interpretation of trends in HPV load. Finally, these data are consistent with the view that the biological properties of the HPV-infected cervix vary with the date of the LMP."
CD008054,0,8747380,0,Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) has been traditionally defined as a continuum of intraepithelial squamous abnormalities which exhibit nuclear atypia in all epithelial layers and possess some potential for progression to invasive carcinoma if not removed. Efforts to subdivide this spectrum into categories of low and high cancer risk have been based previously on the strong association between CIN III (carcinoma in situ) and subsequent invasive carcinoma. However, in practice, this distinction has been discouraged because CIN I and II may be associated with CIN III and a small proportion may progress to invasive carcinoma. As human papillomaviruses (HPV) have emerged as potential markers for subdividing precursor lesions, so-called ""high-risk"" HPV types have been associated with all grades of CIN, whereas ""low-risk"" HPV types have segregated primarily in lesions closely resembling condylomata. The place of condyloma in the spectrum of CIN, as well as the precise definition of CIN I, has been controversial. Some authors distinguish condyloma from CIN I and other use similar criteria for the diagnosis of both. Currently, the trend among pathologists and cytopathologists is to classify CIN I as a process either identical to or closely resembling condyloma (low-grade), and CIN II and III as lesions falling within the spectrum of CIN as classically described (high-grade). As new etiologic perspectives (HPV), classifications (Bethesda) and outpatient managements (LEEP) evolve, morphologic definitions of CIN will remain important to patient care, particularly if management decisions are based on nuances of histologic or cytologic grade. When using cervical lesion morphology as an endpoint in chemoprevention studies, investigators must understand that ""morphologic progression"" of CIN may not be synonymous with biologic progression, that discrepancies between HPV type and morphology exist, and that cytology and histology provide variable, and at times conflicting, information."

Congenital lesions most commonly found in the pediatric population include the thyroglossal duct cyst and the branchial cleft and arch anomalies. The inflammatory masses are secondary to local or systemic infections. The most common etiology for cervical adenopathy in children is reactive lymphadenopathy following a viral or bacterial illness. Persistent adenopathy raises more concerns, especially enlarged lymph nodes within the posterior triangle or supraclavicular space, nodes that are painless, firm, and not mobile, or a single dominant node that persists for more than 6 weeks should all heighten concern for malignancy.

CD008054,0,8441964,0,Parathyroid carcinoma: the relationship of nuclear DNA content to clinical outcome.,"This article reports the use of flow cytometry to determine tumor nuclear DNA content and its correlations with clinical outcome in a series of patients with parathyroid carcinoma. Information concerning nine patients with parathyroid cancer (aged 25 to 88 years) was reviewed. Paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed archival tissue was used to determine tumor DNA content flow cytometrically. Twenty-five operative procedures were performed in nine patients, including 11 parathyroidectomies, two wide local excisions, six central neck dissections, and four median sternotomies for resection of metastases. With flow cytometry used to determine a tumor DNA index, five patients had evidence of tumor aneuploidy; in two patients two aneuploid peaks were evident. The DNA index ranged from 0.7 (hypodiploid) to 1.92 (mean, 1.31). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 18 years. Four patients died. Five were alive 1 to 13 years after diagnosis of parathyroid disease. Four of the five patients with evidence of tumor aneuploidy had metastatic disease and died, and the fifth has had three local recurrences. The four patients with diploid tumors were alive and free of disease 1, 3, 4, and 8 years after the initial operation. It is concluded that in patients with clinically or pathologically demonstrated parathyroid cancer, flow cytometry may help differentiate those whose cancers are likely to behave indolently (diploid tumors) from those with tumors (aneuploid) more likely to behave aggressively by recurring locally or metastasizing."

We established a cohort of women for long-term follow-up to examine the association of serum retinol, carotenoid, and tocopherol concentrations with the clearance of incident cervical HPV infection. Interviews and biological specimens were obtained at baseline and at 4-month intervals. At each visit, a cervical cell specimen for HPV DNA analysis and cytology and a fasting blood sample to measure micronutrient levels were collected. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to study the relationship between clearance of 189 incident (type-specific) oncogenic HPV infections and the levels of 20 serum micronutrients among 122 women. Higher circulating levels of trans-zeaxanthin, total trans-lutein/zeaxanthin, cryptoxanthin (total and beta), total trans-lycopene and cis-lycopene, carotene (alpha, beta, and total), and total carotenoids were associated with a significant decrease in the clearance time of type-specific HPV infection, particularly during the early stages of infection (<or=120 days). HPV clearance time was also significantly shorter among women with the highest compared with the lowest serum levels of alpha-tocopherol and total-tocopherol, but significant trends in these associations were limited to infections lasting <or=120 days.

CD008054,0,15054873,0,"POBASCAM, a population-based randomized controlled trial for implementation of high-risk HPV testing in cervical screening: design, methods and baseline data of 44,102 women.","Cytological cervical screening is rather inefficient because of relatively high proportions of false negative and false positive smears. To evaluate the efficiency of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing, by GP5+/6+ PCR-enzyme immunoassay (EIA), in conjunction with cytology (Intervention Group) to that of the classical cytology (Control Group), we initiated the Population Based Screening Study Amsterdam (POBASCAM). POBASCAM is a population-based randomized controlled trial for implementation of hrHPV testing in cervical screening. The outcome measure is the proportion of histologically confirmed > or =CIN3 lesions in each study arm up to and including the next screening round after 5 years. We present the design, methods and baseline data of POBASCAM. When, in the next 5 years, the follow-up will be completed, the data obtained will be used in model studies, including a cost-effectiveness study, to advise the Dutch Ministry of Public Health in deciding whether cervical screening should be based on combined hrHPV and cytology testing instead of cytology alone. Between January 1999 and September 2002, 44,102 women (mean age = 42.8 years; range = 29-61) that participated in the regular Dutch screening program were included in our study. In the Intervention Group the distribution of cytology and hrHPV by cytology class was as follows: normal cytology 96.6% (3.6% hrHPV positive); borderline and mild dyskaryosis (BMD) 2.5% (34.6% hrHPV positive); and moderate dyskaryosis or worse (>BMD) 0.8% (88.3% hrHPV positive), i.e., 0.4% moderate dyskaryosis (82.9% hrHPV positive), 0.3% severe dyskaryosis (92.5% hrHPV positive), 0.1% carcinoma in situ (95.2% hrHPV positive), <0.1% suspected for invasive cancer (hrHPV positive 100.0%). In the Control Group 96.5% of the women had normal cytology, 2.4% BMD and 0.8% >BMD, i.e., 0.4% moderate dyskaryosis, 0.3% severe dyskaryosis, 0.1% carcinoma in situ, <0.1% suspected for invasive cancer. The presence of hrHPV was age-dependent, decreasing from 12.0% at 29-33 years to 2.4% at 59-61 years. Among women with a positive hrHPV test, the prevalence of BMD was age-dependent ranging from 20.2% at 29-33 years to 7.8% at 54-58 years. In contrast, the risk of >BMD of 13.7% among women with a positive hrHPV test was not age-dependent. Our study indicates that large-scale hrHPV testing by GP5+/6+ PCR-EIA in the setting of population-based cervical screening is practically feasible, is accepted by both participating women and general practitioners and yields highly reproducible results."

Archival tissues on which the original diagnosis of CIN 3 was made were examined. Paraffin sections of 81 CIN 3 lesions from each group were tested for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-6, -11, -16, and -18 DNA sequences by a combination of in of in situ hybridization for viral transcripts and polymerase chain reaction for viral DNA. The virologic profiles of the two groups were similar; HPV-16 and HPV-18 were identified, respectively, in 62% and 6% of CIN 3 lesions of group 1 and in 60% and 2% of CIN 3 lesions of group 2. additional tissues were examined for 17 women of group 2, who progressed from CIN 3 invasive cancer. Progression to invasive cancer was not associated with infection with specific HPV types. It is concluded that the contrasting frequencies of progression to invasive carcinoma in two groups of New Zealand women were not attributable to differences in HPV type distribution in the original CIN 3 lesions of these two groups."

Further findings from this study are reported here after an additional 12 years of follow-up. A nested case--control design was used in which cases were all women diagnosed under 45 years of age with invasive carcinoma (n = 33), carcinoma in situ (n = 121) or dysplasia (n = 159). Controls were randomly selected from among cohort members and matched to cases on exact year of birth and clinic attended at recruitment to study. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to determine odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associated with various aspects of OC use relative to never users adjusted for social class, smoking, age at first birth and ever use of diaphragm or condom. Ever users of OCs had a slightly elevated OR for all types of cervical neoplasia combined (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.00-1.96). Odds ratios were highest for invasive carcinoma (OR = 4.44, 95% CI 1.04-31.6), intermediate for carcinoma in situ (OR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.00-3.00) and lowest for dysplasia (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.69-1.66). The elevated risk associated with OC use appeared to be largely confined to current or recent (last use in the past 2 years) long-term users of OCs. Among current or recent users, ORs for all types of cervical neoplasia combined were 3.34 (95% CI 1.96-5.67) for 49-72 months of use, 1.69 (95% CI 0.97-2.95) for 73-96 months and 2.04 (95% CI 1.34-3.11) for 97 or more months. These results suggest a possible effect of OC use on later stages of cervical carcinogenesis, although residual confounding due to sexual factors or human papillomavirus (HPV) infection cannot be ruled out."

The prodrug was shown to be metabolized intracellularly to 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-N(6)-cyclopropyl-2,6,diaminopurine (cPrPMEDAP) and subsequently deaminated to PMEG. The active form, PMEG diphosphate, was shown to be a potent inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha and beta while showing weaker activity against mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (50% enzyme inhibition observed at 2.5, 1.6, and 59.4 microM, respectively). GS-9191 was markedly more potent than PMEG or cPrPMEDAP in a series of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive cell lines, with effective concentrations to inhibit 50% cell growth (EC(50)) as low as 0.03, 207, and 284 nM, respectively. In contrast, GS-9191 was generally less potent in non-HPV-infected cells and primary cells (EC(50)s between 1 and 15 nM). DNA synthesis was inhibited by GS-9191 within 24 h of treatment; cells were observed to be arrested in S phase by 48 h and to subsequently undergo apoptosis (between 3 and 7 days). In an animal model (cottontail rabbit papillomavirus), topical GS-9191 was shown to decrease the size of papillomas in a dose-related manner. At the highest dose (0.1%), cures were evident at the end of 5 weeks, and lesions did not recur in a 30-day follow-up period. These data suggest that GS-9191 may have utility in the treatment of HPV-induced lesions."

CD008054,0,11192073,0,Immunohistochemical analysis of gynecologic tumors.,"Ancillary techniques such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) enable the surgical pathologist to extract additional information from fixed, deparaffinized tissue specimens and to provide data critical to optimal clinical management of the patient. In this review of applications of IHC to the analysis of gynecologic malignancies, the usefulness of immunohistochemical analysis of neoplasms of the cervix, endometrium, and ovary is summarized. In the uterine cervix, dysplasia is associated with qualitative and quantitative alterations in the expression of the Ki-67 antigen expression, as well as an ability to detect human papillomavirus. Endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas display a highly characteristic immunophenotype, with coexpression of cytokeratin and vimentin and demonstration of foci of high molecular weight cytokeratin expression; in addition, IHC analysis of estrogen and progesterone receptor and p53 expression can provide important prognostic information about this tumor. Stromal tumors of the endometrium may display a partial smooth muscle immunophenotype, but novel markers such as CD10 provide new tools for the identification of these tumors. The immunophenotypes of the normal ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) and corresponding tumors display significant overlap with, but important distinctions from, mesothelium, and important new markers such as the Wilms tumor gene product can prove useful in the identification of carcinomas of the OSE. Important prognostic markers for carcinomas of the OSE include the HER-2/neu gene product and p53, alterations of which can both be assessed by IHC techniques. Finally, the recent availability of markers of ovarian stroma, including Melan-A and inhibin-alpha, has provided a means for the positive identification of ovarian stromal tumors, which can manifest protean histological appearances."
CD008054,0,20829680,0,Adult-type fibrosarcoma: A reevaluation of 163 putative cases diagnosed at a single institution over a 48-year period.,"Adult-type fibrosarcoma (FS) was once considered the most common adult sarcoma, but is now considered a diagnosis of exclusion. No recent series has critically reevaluated putative FSs to estimate their true incidence. One hundred ninety-five cases diagnosed as adult FS in somatic soft tissue were retrieved from our institutional archives for the period 1960 to 2008. Thirty-two cases with insufficient material were excluded. On the basis the morphology of the final 163 cases, immunohistochemical studies (IHC) was conducted using some combination of: wide-spectrum cytokeratin (CK), EMA, high molecular weight CK, S100, Melan A, HMB-45, CD34, TLE1, CD31, HHV8, smooth muscle actin, desmin, ALK1, CD99, Myo-D1, myogenin, c-kit, INI1, CD21, p63, calretinin, WT1, and TTF1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for SYT gene rearrangement was done in 6 putative CK-negative synovial sarcomas (SS). Revised diagnoses were based on clinical, morphologic, IHC, and molecular findings. The original group of putative FS occurred in 84 males and 79 females (median 52.5ây, range 2 to 99ây), and involved various anatomic sites. Only 26 cases met WHO criteria for FS, including 2 postradiation FS. These occurred in 16 males and 10 females (median 50ây, range 6 to 74ây), and involved the lower extremities (12 cases), head/ neck (5 cases), trunk (4 cases), upper extremities (3 case), and mediastinum/abdomen (2 cases). Clinical follow-up information was available for 24 of 26 (92%) cases, with a median of 5 years follow-up (range <1 to 35ây). Twelve patients (50%) died of locally aggressive and/or metastatic disease (median follow-up 1-year; range <1 to 8ây), 6 patients (25%) were alive without disease (median follow-up 11.5ây; range 2.5 to 35ây), and 6 patients (25%) died of other causes (median follow-up 10ây; range 9 to 18ây) (). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was positive for SYT gene rearrangement in all cases tested. Non-FS (137 cases) were reclassified as: undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (32 cases), SS (21 cases), solitary fibrous tumor (14 cases), myxofibrosarcoma (11 cases), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (8 cases), FS dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and desmoplastic melanoma (4 cases each), low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, desmoid-type fibromatosis, rhabdomyosarcoma, myofibroblastic sarcoma, spindle-cell liposarcoma (3 cases each), sclerosing epithelioid FS, fibroma-like epithelioid sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, cellular fibrous histiocytoma (2 cases each), and others (17 cases). Using modern diagnostic criteria with ancillary IHC and molecular genetics, we have been able to reclassify 84% of putative FS. Exclusive of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, the distinction of which from FS is subjective, 64% of putative FS were reclassified, most commonly as monophasic SS and solitary fibrous tumor. We conclude that true FS is exceedingly rare, accounting for <1% of approximately 10,000 adult soft tissue sarcomas seen at our institution during this time period, and should be diagnosed with great caution."
CD008054,0,12496039,0,Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes and associations with cancer risk.,"Common polymorphisms in DNA repair genes may alter protein function and an individual's capacity to repair damaged DNA; deficits in repair capacity may lead to genetic instability and carcinogenesis. To establish our overall understanding of possible in vivo relationships between DNA repair polymorphisms and the development of cancer, we performed a literature review of epidemiological studies that assessed associations between such polymorphisms and risk of cancer. Thirty studies of polymorphisms in OGG1, XRCC1, ERCC1, XPC, XPD, XPF, BRCA2, and XRCC3 were identified in the April 30, 2002 MEDLINE database (National Center for Biotechnology Information. PubMed Database: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez). These studies focused on adult glioma, bladder cancer, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer (melanoma and nonmelanoma), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and stomach cancer. We found that a small proportion of the published studies were large and population-based. Nonetheless, published data were consistent with associations between: (a) the OGG1 S326C variant and increased risk of various types of cancer; (b) the XRCC1 R194W variant and reduced risk of various types of cancer; and (c) the BRCA2 N372H variant and increased risk of breast cancer. Suggestive results were seen for polymorphisms in other genes; however, small sample sizes may have contributed to false-positive or false-negative findings. We conclude that large, well-designed studies of common polymorphisms in DNA repair genes are needed. Such studies may benefit from analysis of multiple genes or polymorphisms and from the consideration of relevant exposures that may influence the likelihood of cancer in the presence of reduced DNA repair capacity."

Cytology specimens were collected from patients at the time of colposcopic evaluation for management of a previous abnormal cytology test result. Telomerase activity was evaluated by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP), and HPV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction with L1 consensus-sequence primers and filter hybridization genotyping. Telomerase was detected in 8 of 97 (8.2%) cases with normal cytology or benign cellular changes, in 7 of 98 (7.1%) cases of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), in 3 of 95 (3.2%) cases of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), and in 17 of 48 (35.4%) cases with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). High-risk HPVs were detected in 23 of 97 (23.7%) cases with normal/reactive cellular changes (RCC) cytology, in 28 of 98 (28.6%) cases of ASCUS, in 69 of 95 (72.6%) cases of LSIL, and in 35 of 48 (72.9%) cases of HSIL. Telomerase expression did not correlate with the detection of high-risk HPVs in any cytological diagnostic categories. Telomerase and HPV test results of cytological specimens were correlated with the histological diagnoses of concurrent cervical biopsy specimens. Telomerase showed a sensitivity of 29.9% and a specificity of 94.0% for biopsy-confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II/III. In contrast, high-risk HPVs were detected in 70.1% of cases with underlying CIN II/III, with a specificity of 62.5%. A relatively high proportion of normal/RCC or ASCUS cases with telomerase-positive test results had underlying high-grade dysplasia on cervical biopsy. Thus, technical and practical limitations of the TRAP assay in cervical cytology specimens limit the practical application of telomerase as a diagnostic adjunct in cervical cytopathology."

To estimate the longevity of responses induced by HPV-16 vaccination, two models were fitted to serum anti-HPV-16 levels measured during a 48-month study period. The first was a conventional model of antibody decay and the second was a modified model that accounts for long-lived immune memory. Using the antibody decay model, it was estimated that following administration of a three-dose regimen of HPV-16 vaccine in women aged 16-23 years, anti-HPV-16 levels will remain above those induced naturally by HPV-16 infection for 12 years, and above detectable levels for 32 years in 50% of vaccinees. With the modified model, which fitted the data better (p<0.001), it was estimated that near life-long persistence of anti-HPV-16 following vaccination is expected at titer levels above those associated with reduction of natural HPV-16 infection in 76% of these subjects, and above detectable levels in 99% of these subjects."

Two adults achieved complete remissions for at least 2 consecutive months, and both patients developed only minimal recurrent disease in 4 months of follow-up. The other adult and the child sustained a partial response and an increased interval between the required surgeries. Ribavirin caused only a mild, reversible reduction in hemoglobin and reticulocytosis. This preliminary trial shows that ribavirin may be an effective therapy in combination with surgery for LP in a larger controlled clinical trial."
CD008054,0,11219765,0,High-risk human papillomavirus is sexually transmitted: evidence from a follow-up study of virgins starting sexual activity (intercourse).,"Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is generally considered to be sexually transmitted. However, nonsexual spread of the virus has also been suggested. The goal of this study was to assess: (a) the role of sexual intercourse in the transmission of HPV; (b) the determinants for seroconversion; and (c) the correlation between HPV DNA, abnormal cervical cytology, and serological response to HPV16. One hundred virgins and 105 monogamous women were randomly selected from a population-based cohort study in Copenhagen, Denmark, in which the women were examined twice with 2-year interval (interview, cervical swabs, Pap smear, blood samples). The presence of HPV DNA was determined by GP5+/6+ primers based HPV-PCR-EIA. HPV 16 virus-like particles (VLP) antibodies were detected by ELISA. All of the virgins were both HPV DNA negative and seronegative to VLP16, except for one woman who was weakly HPV 6 DNA positive. Only those virgins who initiated sexual activity became HPV DNA positive and/or VLP16 positive. The most important determinant of HPV DNA acquisition was the number of partners between the two examinations. The only significant risk factor for HPV 16 VLP seroconversion among women acquiring HPV DNA was HPV type. Our results show that sexual intercourse is important in the transmission of HPV, and that HPV 16 VLP seroconversion and the development of cervical lesions only occur after HPV transmission. Remarkably, no cervical lesions were found in HPV 16 DNA positive women who had seroconverted. Although based on small numbers, this may suggest that the development of antibodies had a protective effect."

CD008054,0,17245729,0,High-risk HPV presence in cervical specimens after a large loop excision of the cervical transformation zone: significance of newly detected hr-HPV genotypes.,"Large loop excision of the cervical transformation zone (LLETZ) is a well-established treatment for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. It has even been postulated that LLETZ is responsible for the elimination of the infectious agent, human papillomavirus (HPV), causing the lesion. Most studies on HPV detection after LLETZ have focused on the persistence of high-risk (hr-) HPV to identify women at risk for residual or recurrent disease. Therefore, the appearance and significance of hr-HPV types newly detected after surgical treatment has not been studied extensively so far. The presence of hr-HPV in 85 high-grade squamous cervical LLETZ biopsies and in the first follow-up smear was determined. In 80 (94%) of the LLETZ biopsies hr-HPV was detected in contrast to 30 (35%) hr-HPV positive follow-up scrapes. Twenty of the 80 hr-HPV positive women (25%) had the same hr-HPV genotypes in their follow-up cervical smears as was found in the corresponding biopsies. In the follow-up smear of 13 women a new hr-HPV genotype was detected and HPV 18 was newly detected in 8 of them. The remarkably high presence of newly detected HPV 18 genotypes may argue for a release or re-activation of this virus from proximal layers of the cervical canal incised during surgery."
CD008054,0,9709302,0,Management of cervical neoplasia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women.,"The existence of cervical neoplasia in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) represents one of the most serious challenges in the oncologic care of immunosuppressed patients. While the development of most cancers in the immunosuppressed patient can be attributed solely to immune deficiency, the relationship between squamous cell neoplasia of the cervix and HIV is quite unique because of common sexual behavioral risk factors. Screening strategies in HIV-positive women must take into account the high prevalence of cervical dysplasia in this subgroup as well as the limitations of cytologic screening. Cervical dysplasia in HIV-positive women may be of higher grade than in HIV-negative patients, with more extensive involvement of the lower genital tract with HPV-associated lesions. The presence and severity of cervical neoplasia in HIV-positive women correlate with both quantitative and qualitative T-cell function. Standard therapies for preinvasive cervical disease have yielded suboptimal results with high recurrent rates. While poor treatment results of standard ablative and excisional therapies warrant unique therapeutic strategies, one must recognize that close surveillance and repetitive treatment have been successful in preventing progressive neoplasia and invasive cervical carcinoma. The disease characteristics of invasive cervical carcinoma may take a more aggressive clinical course in HIV-infected women. HIV-positive women with cervical cancer have higher recurrence and death rates with shorter intervals to recurrence and death than do HIV-negative control subjects. CD4 status does influence subsequent outcome. In general, the same principles that guide the oncologic management of cervical cancer in immunocompetent patients should be applied. However, extremely close monitoring for both therapeutic efficacy and unusual toxicity must be instituted."
CD008054,0,17041955,0,ASC-US and high-risk HPV testing: performance in daily clinical practice.,"Data are beginning to accrue on high-risk HPV DNA testing in patients with ASC-US on cervical cytology. We report on our experience at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics. From February 2002 through December 31, 2005 (3 yr, 11 mo), the cytopathology laboratory processed 49,599 Pap Tests, of which 1,792 (3.6%) were diagnosed as ASC-US. Six hundred and seventy two (37.5%) of these cases were processed for high-risk HPV genotypes using the Digene Hybrid Capture II method. Of these cases, 266 (39.6%) were positive for high-risk HPV genotypes, 11 (1.6%) were equivocal, and 395 (58.8%) were negative. Biopsy follow-up was available for 127 (47.7%) of the 266 cases, of which 66 (52%) were negative, 46 (36.2%) showed CIN I, 9 (7.1%) were CIN II, and 6 (4.7%) were CIN III. Of the remaining 139 (52.3%) cases, 86 (62%) had follow-up Pap Tests, of which 57 (66.3%) were negative, 15 (17.4%) were ASC-US, 12 (15%) were low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 2 (2.3%) were high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions; 53 (38.1%) were lost to follow-up. In combination, 90 (42.25%) of the 213 cases with follow-up showed atypia or above after a diagnosis of ASC-US; of which 58 (64%) were low-grade lesions and 17 (19%) were high-grade lesions. Our laboratory's reported high-risk HPV positivity is comparable to recent reports in the literature on its use in daily clinical practice. In addition, cervical abnormalities were found in a significant proportion of the cases."

CD008054,0,17041957,0,"Upregulation of telomerase (hTERT) is related to the grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, but is not an independent predictor of high-risk human papillomavirus, virus persistence, or disease outcome in cervical cancer.","Telomerase activation and telomere maintenance are essential for cell immortalization and represent a rate-limiting step in cancer progression. The E6 oncoprotein of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to activate telomerase, but its expression in CIN lesions and its prognostic value in cervical cancer (CC) are still incompletely understood. As part of our HPV-PathogenISS study, a series of 150 CCs and 152 CIN lesions were examined using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for hTERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), and tested for HPV using PCR with three primer sets (MY09/11, GP5(+)/GP6(+), SPF). Follow-up data were available from all SCC patients, and 67 CIN lesions had been monitored with serial PCR for HPV after cone treatment. Expression of hTERT was increased in parallel with the grade of CIN, with major up-regulation upon transition to CIN3 (OR 18.81; 95% CI 8.48-41.69; P = 0.0001). Positive hTERT expression was 90% specific indicator of CIN, with 98.7% PPV, but suffers from low sensitivity (57.5%) and NPV (14.3%). hTERT expression was also significantly associated to HR-HPV with OR 3.38 (95% CI 1.90-6.02; P = 0.0001), but this association was confounded by the histological grade (Mantel-Haenszel common OR = 1.83; 95% CI 0.92-3.79; P = 0.086). Expression of hTERT did not predict clearance/persistence of HR-HPV after treatment of CIN, and it was not a prognostic predictor in cervical cancer in univariate or multivariate survival analysis. It was concluded that up-regulation of hTERT was closely associated with HR-HPV, due to activation by the E6 oncoprotein. hTERT is a late marker of cervical carcinogenesis, significantly associated with progression to CIN3. Theoretically, a combination of hTERT assay (showing high SP and PPV) with another test showing high SE and high NPV (e.g. Hybrid Capture 2 for HPV), should provide an ideal screening tool capable of high-performance detection of CIN lesions."

It explains the rationale behind the South African cervical cancer screening policy, which is to offer all asymptomatic women three free cervical smears in a lifetime, beginning at age 30, 10 years apart. Further, it illustrates that cervical cancer screening offers unique opportunities for prevention at both the primary and secondary levels. The causal association of human papillomavirus infection of the cervix and the possibility for vaccination against the virus is discussed. The history of screening in South Africa and why it has failed to make a major impact to date on the morbidity and mortality of cervical cancer is also discussed. Finally, possible alternative approaches to cervical cytology for the prevention of cervical cancer are briefly reviewed."

In this feasibility study, we used microsatellite analysis to detect tumor-specific genetic alterations in exfoliated oral mucosal cell samples from patients with known cancer. Exfoliated mucosal cells in pretreatment oral rinse and swab samples were collected from 44 HNSCC patients and from 43 healthy control subjects (20 nonsmokers and 23 smokers). We tested a panel of 23 informative microsatellite markers to assay DNA from the matched lymphocyte, tumor (from cancer cases), and oral test samples. Loss of heterozygosity or microsatellite instability of at least one marker was detected in 38 (86%) of 44 primary tumors. Identical alterations were found in the saliva samples in 35 of these 38 cases (92% of those with markers; 79% overall) including 12 of 13 cases with small primaries [stage Tt or Tx (occult primary)] and 4 of 4 cases of patients that had undergone prior radiation. Microsatellite instability was detectable in the saliva in 24 (96%) of 25 cases in which it was present in the tumor, and loss of heterozygosity was identified in the test sample in 19 (61%) of 31 cases. No microsatellite alterations were detected in any of the samples from the healthy control subjects. This approach must now be refined and validated for the detection of clinically occult disease. Microsatellite analysis of oral samples may then become a valuable method for detecting and monitoring HNSCC."
CD008054,0,18623128,0,Host and viral factors in relation to clearance of human papillomavirus infection: a cohort study in Taiwan.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) persistence is essential for cervical cancer development. We accrued nested-cohort subjects from a population-based study to investigate the host and viral factors related to outcome of HPV infection. Women (age > or = 30 years old) with HPV-positive but normal cytology and negative colposcopy were invited to participate. After signing informed consent, every participant completed a structured questionnaire and had 6-monthly follow-ups of Pap smear, HPV testing and colposcopy. Total and type-specific HPV clearance rates as well as host and viral factors associated with clearance in 3-year longitudinal follow-up were analyzed. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of progression to > or = cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 according to baseline HPV of the women with normal cytology were calculated from national registry database. Among the 626 eligible women, 526 (median age 47, 29-75) were enrolled and 412 returned for follow-up at least once. The median follow-up of enrolled subjects was 23 months (range 6.8-39). The 3-year cumulative total HPV clearance rate was 49.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 43.3-54.7%). The median 3-year cumulative type-specific HPV clearance rate was 50.0% (range 0-100.0%) with a median time to clearance of 12.4 months (6.4-24.5). Older age was associated with significantly decreased total HPV clearance and decreased type-specific clearance in HPV-18 and -53, while high viral load was associated with decreased total and type-specific clearance. After adjusting confounding variables, the HR of developing > or =CIN2 in baseline HPV-positive women was 34.0-fold (95% CI: 15.5-74.7) as compared to HPV-negative women."

We investigated the clinical use of cotesting for women with negative Papanicolaou tests. Follow-up cytology, HR-HPV test, and biopsy findings were identified during an 18-month period. In 1 year, 2,719 cotests from 2,686 women were identified; 146 were positive for HR-HPV. Among women with positive HR-HPV testing, 120 had follow-up, including 70 with repeated cotesting, and 3 had high-grade dysplasia identified (2.5% of women with follow-up). In 1,334 women with initial double-negative cotest results who had repeated cytologic testing within 18 months, 2 high-grade dysplasias were found (0.1%).

CD008054,0,10388122,0,Hereditary Factors in Gynecologic Cancer.,"Cancer predisposition in some families is known to be the result of germ-line mutations. The most noteworthy hereditary gynecologic cancer syndromes include hereditary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, wherein BRCA1 and BRCA2 germ-line mutations have been identified, and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) of the Lynch syndrome II variant, wherein hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS2, hMSH3, and hMSH6 germ-line mutations have been identified. DNA testing for specific cancer-associated germ-line mutations is now available for HBOC and HNPCC syndrome family members who are in the direct line of inheritance. Genetic counseling is mandatory prior to DNA testing and at the time of disclosure of findings. A patient found to be negative for the family's particular cancer-associated germ-line mutation can revert to general population screening recommendations. When a deleterious mutation is identified, the physician is able to predict a patient's lifetime susceptibility to breast and ovarian carcinomas in the HBOC syndrome or the cancers which characterize the Lynch syndrome II variant of HNPCC, particularly carcinomas of the colon, endometrium, and ovary. Management strategies can be offered which are designed to take advantage of the natural history of that distinct hereditary cancer syndrome. We discuss the unfolding developments concerning familial and heritable susceptibilities, molecular genetics, and possible carcinogenic co-factors of the three most common gynecologic cancers: carcinomas of the uterine cervix, endometrium, and ovary. We offer rationales for management based on current epidemiologic and clinical data and emerging technologies."
CD008054,0,15756673,0,Chlamydia trachomatis infection and persistence of human papillomavirus.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) persistence is the major cause of cervical cancer, but most HPV infections will not persist and risk factors for HPV persistence are not well known. Chlamydia (C.) trachomatis infection seems to also be associated with cervical cancer. We investigated whether C. trachomatis infection is a risk factor for HPV persistence. In a cohort of 12,527 women participating in a population-based HPV screening trial in Sweden, 6,418 women completed testing for HPV DNA by general primer PCR and typing by reverse dot blot hybridization. On average 19 months later, 303 women that had been HPV-positive and had normal cytology at enrollment completed a new HPV test. Environmental exposures were assessed by an 87-item questionnaire. Previous sexually transmitted infections were also investigated by serology. At follow-up, 44% of the women were positive for the same type of HPV DNA as at enrollment. Persistence correlated with length of follow-up (p < 0.01) and condom use seemed to protect against HPV persistence (p < 0.05). The most significant risk factor for persistent presence of HPV DNA was self-reported history of previous C. trachomatis infection (relative risk in multivariate model = 2.09; 95% confidence interval = 1.05-4.18). We conclude that persistence of oncogenic HPV infections is more likely among women with a previous C. trachomatis infection."

Its relation with p53 and the determination of proliferation indices].,"Thirty-seven nasopharyngeal carcinomas were studied obtaining the tissue from nasopharyngeal biopsies that were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. The patients were born in Argentina, 23 men and 14 women with a mean age of 50 years. Histologically the tumors were classified as queratinizing squamous cell carcinomas, 1 case (2%); non-queratinizing squamous cell carcinomas, 15 cases (41%) and undifferentiated carcinomas, 21 cases (57%). The proliferating index (PI) was determined using monoclonal antibodies against PCNA and Ki-67 (MIB-1), resulting in 26% for PCNA and 17% for Ki-67 while no differences were found comparing PI with histological type and cases with clinical stage III and IV. The PI was of 2% in the 3 cases with clinical stage II. Immunostains for p53 were positive in 30 out of the 37 cases with no differences between the histological types, exception made for the queratinizing carcinoma which was negative. With a cut off point of 7% in the 12 cases with follow up, two groups were found with a mean survival of 35 and 12 months, a finding that was not statistically significant. Epstein-Barr virus was detected by PCR using the paraffin embedded material in 31 out of the 37 cases: 21 were undifferentiated carcinomas and 15 non-queratinizing squamous cell carcinomas; the queratinizing squamous cell carcinoma was negative. These results, published for the first time in samples from Argentinian patients are similar to those found in areas of high and low incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinomas and can be of clinical use in determining the nasopharyngeal origin of a cervical metastatic lymph node of an unknown primary."

We have recently shown that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1982073 of the TGFbeta1 gene (TGFB1) is associated with the survival of HNSCC patients who have undergone CRT. In order to evaluate possible mechanisms mediating this, we investigated if the TGFB1 polymorphism was associated with the severity of mucositis induced by CRT. Peripheral blood DNA of 34 HNSCC patients who had undergone CRT was genotyped for the SNP rs1982073 of the TGFB1. Mucositis was graded according to acute toxicity criteria of radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG). The mean follow-up time was 48 months (range, 4-115 months). We did not find a significant association between the TGFB1 polymorphism and the degree of acute mucositis (OD=2.65; 95% CI 0.50-13.89; p=0.25). The degree of acute mucositis was not connected to disease-free survival (p=0.35).

A total of 38 representatives and specialists for colposcopy and cervical pathology were contacted to provide national guidelines, recommendations or consensus for the management of patients diagnosed with the cytologic diagnosis of low-grade SIL. In all, 23 addressees (60%) responded. The algorithms provided varied considerably. Three variants of algorithms could be defined. Variant 1 was proposed in 14 countries and recommended colposcopy immediately after cytologic diagnosis of low-grade SIL or at the same time the smear is taken. If available, HPV testing was recommended as a triage option in some countries. Variant 2 is used in three countries and colposcopy is only performed after a repeated abnormal cytologic result within a 6-month interval or after an optional test positive for high-risk HPV. Variant 3, as proposed in six countries, takes into account the socio-economic status of the patient: In patients with poor compliance, 'see and treat' management is recommended; in patients where compliance can be assured, follow-up is carried out by cytology and colposcopy. Global policy of management of patients with low-grade SIL can be summarised in three algorithms. Quality standards and outcome parameters must be defined in order to improve the management of women with low-grade SIL."

Although Pap cytology has had a significant history as a key method for cervical cancer screening, not all countries have benefited from this technology or have been able to implement the necessary public health steps to manage and treat the precancerous lesions that are detected by the Pap test. Testing of cervical exfoliated cells for DNA of oncogenic HPV types has been proven to be more accurate than Pap cytology. The latter test's high specificity makes it an ideal technique to triage women who are found to be HPV positive via a primary screen. HPV testing followed by Pap testing only for HPV-positive women is a promising strategy for screening women in the post-vaccination era."

Fourteen patients with histologically proven UCNT (2 had locoregional disease alone and 12 metastatic disease) who were refractory to conventional chemotherapy, were treated with IFN gamma 20 x 10(6) U twice a week. Treatment was well tolerated. No objective response were achieved in the 13 evaluated patients, and all patients progressed after a median treatment duration of 10 weeks (6-32).

Its possible place in the management of UCNT is probably earlier in the natural history of this disease."
CD008054,0,14578140,0,Determinants of human papillomavirus load among women with histological cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3: dominant impact of surrounding low-grade lesions.,"Measurement of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA load has been suggested as a means for improving the positive predictive value of HPV testing for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 and cancer (CIN3+). We hypothesized that lesions surrounding CIN3+ (especially the extent of associated CIN1) are important determinants of load, which limit its clinical use. To test this hypothesis, we reviewed the pathology of women at enrollment in the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study who were managed at enrollment with oncogenic HPV testing using Hybrid Capture 2 (Digene Corp., Gaithersburg, MD) or colposcopy. We focused our analysis on 133 cases of CIN3+ that were identified, stratified by the number of HPV types detected using a PCR-based method (62 single, 71 multiple infections). Infection with multiple types (P < 0.01) and identification of CIN1 or CIN2 in tissues surrounding CIN3 (P = 0.01) were each significantly associated with higher load (two-way ANOVA). Higher load was associated with more extensive CIN1 (P < 0.01), especially when associated with multiple HPV types. Intensive partial rescreening of enrollment thin-layer slides obtained from women with histopathological CIN3+ revealed that ASC-US/LSIL cells were more numerous than ASC-H/HSIL cells. ASC-US/LSIL cell counts were significantly correlated with load (r = 0.31; P < 0.01), whereas counts of ASC-H/HSIL cells were uncorrelated. We conclude that the extent of histopathological CIN1, number of HPV types, and the number of ASC-US/LSIL cells in exfoliative cervical samples vary greatly among cases of CIN3+ and strongly affect HPV load. These factors severely limit the clinical use of load measurements irrespective of HPV testing methodology."

They can occur in one or multiple areas of the female genitalia. Usually, the vulva is the initial site of implantation for HPV. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the epidemiological aspects, incidence of single or multiple lesions in the lower genital tract, correlation between sexual behaviour and their localization and behaviour risk factors for persistence and recurrence of HPV lesions and cervical intraepithelial lesion (CIN) in a long-term follow-up among young women. We recruited 268 patients aged 11-21 years who previously had cytology and/or physical examination suspicious for HPV infection. The women were interviewed and asked information about lifestyle, sexual behaviour, work, personal or family history of genital warts and school attendance. We considered individuals to be 'smokers' if they smoked more than five cigarettes/day. No specific data were recorded about oral contraception, nevertheless, no woman had used oral contraceptives (OCs) for more than 2 years. Young women included in the study were between the age of 12 and 21 years who had HVP lesions after entry examinations and had undergone no treatment for HPV lesions prior to entry. Other exclusion criteria relevant to this study included cervical excisional treatment prior to entry or later. Two hundred and thirty-four young women were included in our study group. Our diagnostic schedule for a complete evaluation included exo- and endocervical cytology, colposcopy, directed biopsy and microcolpohysteroscopy. The treatment was performed with a LASER CO2 Coherent 400, model 451, with Zeiss photocolposcopy attachment. The finding that, among 126/234 (53.8%) adolescents using contraceptives, only 85 (36.3%) have used condom, the only barrier form of contraceptive effectively protecting against virus, shows a low awareness of the high risk for contracting HPV infection among young sexually active women. The sites most frequently affected in our study were vulva, perianus and perineum (194/234), 82.9% and the cervix (125/234), 53.4%. Vaginal lesions were detected only in 29/234 patients (12.3%). According to our data, in 161 patients, sexual habits, age at the first intercourse (P=0.68), frequency of intercourses (P=0.49) and number of lifetime partners (P=0.27) as well as age (P=0.26) play a role in transmission and incidence of HPV infection but not on the location of the lesions. This can be due to a coexistent clinical and subclinical multiple infection as well as a transmission via intercourse or from other sources, including tampons. Abnormal Pap test was related to HPV infection, but the low correlation with colposcopic and histological findings in this study justify the support of other examinations such as colposcopy and punch biopsy for diagnosis. Moreover, according to our data, cytology alone shows to be not suitable to exclude CIN (seven underestimated cases of CIN) and a closer correspondence were found between colposcopy and the result of histological sample after punch biopsy in CIN detection. More attention must be paid to psychological aspect of diagnoses and treatment among adolescents, more than older women as the high rate of patients lost shows in our study: 75/234 (32.05%) before LASER surgery and 55/159 (34.59%) during follow-up. International data shows that only 12-45% of sexually active adolescent girls have obtained Pap smear screening. In our study, we found no correlation between treatment failure and cigarette smoking or between the use of oral contraceptives and persistence/recurrence after LASER CO2 surgery. Because the small sample of our study group, further analyses were required."

The E6 gene product of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 can inactivate the p53 protein by promoting its degradation. Because most HPV-positive cervical carcinoma cell lines contain wild-type p53 whereas HPV-negative cell lines have point mutations in the p53 gene, a major role in the development of HPV-negative cervical cancer has been attributed to p53. Recent studies, however, have observed no consistent presence of p53 mutation in HPV-negative primary cervical carcinomas. The MDM2 oncogene, which forms an autoregulatory loop with the wild-type p53 protein, has been found amplified in a high percentage of human sarcomas, thus abolishing the antiproliferative function of p53."

The presence and amount of spliced transcripts were correlated with DNA viral markers such as E2/E6 ratio and physical state. The detection of HPV 16 E6*I/E6*II mRNAs was set up by an SYBR Green real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay with an optimal dynamic range and sensitivity. The assay was applied to the analysis of 71 specimens, positive to HPV 16 as a sole infection, from women with abnormal cervical smears, precisely 31 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and 40 high-grade lesions. Samples negative to both transcripts were found only in low-grade cervical lesions. Three different transcription profiles were found in the low- and high-grade lesions analyzed: in low-grade lesions samples positive only to E6*II and in high-grade lesions samples positive only to E6*I were detected. In low- and high-grade lesions, samples positive to both E6*I and E6*II were found. In the samples positive for both transcripts, the E6*I/E6*II ratio was higher than that in the majority of high-grade lesions and lower than that in all the low-grade lesions. Analyzing the transcription pattern in relation to E2/E6 ratio and to the DNA physical state, the presence of high values of E6*I was associated mainly with low values of E2/E6 ratio and of mixed DNA forms. The detection of HPV 16 E6*I/E6*II mRNAs may serve to identify transcription patterns indicative of cervical disease progression and help physicians to decide clinical management."

The aim of our study was to investigate whether HPV is present in both CIN III (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) lesions and bronchopulmonary second primary cancers in women with a clinical history of both diseases. Paraffin-embedded tumour tissue from 75 patients with bronchopulmonary carcinomas was examined using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and in situ hybridization for the presence of human HPV. In total, 51 primary tumours without metastases, 11 primary tumours with metastases and 13 lymph node metastases without available tissue from primary tumours were analysed. In our study 37/75 primary bronchopulmonary tumours (49%) were identified as HPV positive by the PCR method: 18 cases were purely HPV 16 positive (49%), 12 were purely HPV 6 positive (32%), 5 cases were HPV 16/6 positive (14%), 1 case was HPV 16/11 positive (2%) and 1 case was HPV 16/18 positive (2%). Fourteen metastases were HPV positive, and HPV 16, 11 and 6 were detected in both regional and distant metastases. Two of the HPV 16-positive metastases were brain metastases from two separate HPV 16-positive primary tumours; 35% of the HPV-positive cases were adenocarcinomas, 30% squamous cell carcinomas, 22% oat cell carcinomas, 5% large cell carcinomas, 3% anaplastic carcinoma, 3% low-differentiated carcinoma, and 3% malignant cylindroma. The CIN III lesions from 34 of the 37 HPV-positive bronchopulmonary carcinomas were analysed by PCR. The overall HPV positivity in the CIN III lesions was 74% (25/34 cases): 48% were purely HPV 16 positive, 24% purely HPV 6 positive, 24% HPV 16/6 positive and 4% were HPV 18 positive. Our results indicate that HPV is also involved in the development of bronchopulmonary cancers in women with a history of CIN III lesions."

For the estimation of the model parameters, data of recent Dutch follow-up studies were reanalyzed. The predicted incidences of cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1, CIN2 and CIN3) and abnormal cytology were validated with nationwide figures and population-based screening results. The model predicted a lifetime risk for cervical cancer of 2.9% with a peak at age 48 years. The predicted lifetime risk dropped to 0.4% when attending cervical screening. For women who were not hrHPV infected at 30 years, the lifetime risk was 1.6%. Sensitivity analyses were performed to check natural history assumptions that were only weakly identified from available data sets. The incidence of CIN3 observed with screening appeared a useful clinical end point as the predicted incidence was robust against changes in the sensitivity of cervical cytology and the duration to CIN3. The model can be used to study the health-economic benefits that can be achieved in nationwide screening when including an hrHPV test."

Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing was performed from the same residual liquid-based cytologic specimen, and results for both tests were correlated with histologic follow-up data. Sensitivity values for high-grade CIN (HGCIN) confirmed on biopsy within 6 months were 92.6% (ASC-US) and 92.2% (LSIL) for cytotechnologists' reviews of p16 cytology and 90.1% (ASC-US) and 95.7% (LSIL) for HPV testing. Sensitivity rates of initial pathologists' reviews were slightly lower, 76.4% to 80.1%, with levels comparable to cytotechnologists' results after adjudication. The specificity of p16 cytology for HGCIN detection was significantly higher than for HPV testing for cytotechnologists and pathologists: 63.2% to 71.1% (p16 cytology) vs 37.8% for HPV in ASC-US (P < .001) and 37.3% to 53.3% (p16 cytology) vs 18.5% for HPV in LSIL (P < .001).

Clinical evaluation and follow-up.,"The purpose of this study was to detect and genotype 16 different human papilloma virus (HPV) types simultaneously using a short fragment polymerase chain reaction (SPF) hybridization line probe assay (LiPA). 152 women who were referred to the gynecologist because of abnormal cervical smear underwent colposcopic examination and repeat cervical smear. In addition, the cervical scrapes were analyzed for the presence of HPV by a novel general HPV polymerase chain reaction assay followed by a single reaction genotyping assay allowing for a simultaneous detection and identification of 16 different HPV types. HPV DNA was detected in 38% of normal follow-up cervical scrapes, 51% of scrapes with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 78% of scrapes with mild dysplasia (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), 86% of scrapes with moderate dysplasia (high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), and in 88% of scrapes with severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. One case of invasive squamous cell carcinoma was positive for HPV 16. Overall, a single HPV type was detected in 56% of HPV positive scrapes, with HPV 16 being the most common and accounting for 45% of all single infections. Forty-four percent of the positive scrapes contained multiple HPV types, of which double infections prevailed. Follow-up results proved the reproducibility and reliability of SPF HPV LiPA. In conclusion, we have used and evaluated the SPF-HPV-LiPA system for the detection and genotyping of HPV infections. The combined detection-typing method proved to be sensitive, specific, simple, and fast, making mass screening of cervical scrapes accessible for routine practice and facilitating individual patient management."

CD008054,0,9950162,0,Loss of retinoblastoma protein expression in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Laryngeal carcinomas are among the most curable malignancies, but some of them show poor clinical outcomes with local recurrence or regional neck metastasis. Multiple genetic alterations of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are thought to occur in the development some tumors. The frequency, however, and the prognostic significance of these genes or gene products still remain unknown in laryngeal carcinoma. Epidemiologic data suggest that cigarette smoking is closely related to the development of these neoplasms; and human papillomavirus (HPV) infections have also been postulated to play a role in development of laryngeal tumor. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of retinoblastoma protein (pRb), p53 protein, and HPV infection in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, as well as the correlation of these factors with clinicopathologic and carcinogenic factors. Tumors from 79 patients with primary laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma were studied. The expression of pRb was immunohistochemically assessed in 79 such tumors, and the expression of p53 was assessed in 76 tumors. HPV Type 16 expression was estimated by nonisotopic in situ hybridization in 78 cases. Follow-up periods ranged from 15 to 90 months. pRb was detected in 82% of the tumors and p53 in 43%. Lack of staining for pRb was significantly associated with a high-histologic grade (P<.05), high T classification (P<.05), recurrence (P<.05), and a relatively short disease-free interval (P<.01). p53 overexpression was observed frequently in heavy smokers with an average Brinkman index of more than 800, but it was not associated with any of the clinicopathologic factors studied. These findings suggest that tumors exhibiting loss of pRb expression have a more aggressive biologic behavior than do those that express pRb and that loss of pRb expression might predict clinical outcome in patients with primary laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma."
CD008054,0,7859453,0,History of long-term use of depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate in patients with cervical dysplasia; case-control analysis nested in a cohort study. The New Zealand Contraception and Health Study Group.,"Histories of use of depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) given by women entering a previously-reported prospective study of risk of cervical dysplasia, including carcinoma, have been evaluated. Over a six-year follow-up period, 348 of the 7199 enrolled women developed cervical dysplasia diagnosed by cytology and confirmed by histology or DNA analysis. Use of MPA prior to entry into the study was reported somewhat more commonly and for somewhat longer periods by the women who developed confirmed dysplasia than by those who did not. However, this association was accounted for entirely by the fact that women who reported use of MPA, particularly at an early age, tended to carry a number of known strong risk factors for dysplasia, specifically, first intercourse at an early age, multiple sex partners and cigarette smoking. These findings indicate that the lack of relationship of MPA use to risk of cervical dysplasia, noted previously for women whose median duration of use within the formal study period was about 2 years, extended to the same women who used MPA prior to the study period--even to those whose duration of prior use was 4 years or more."

CD008054,0,20853152,0,The ethics of implementing human papillomavirus vaccination in developed countries.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the world's most common sexually transmitted infection. It is a prerequisite for cervical cancer, the second most common cause of death in cancer among women worldwide, and is also believed to cause other anogenital and head and neck cancers. Vaccines that protect against the most common cancer-causing HPV types have recently become available, and different countries have taken different approaches to implementing vaccination. This paper examines the ethics of alternative HPV vaccination strategies. It devotes particular attention to the major arguments for and against one strategy: voluntary, publicly funded vaccination for all adolescent boys and girls. This approach seems attractive because it would protect more people against cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers than less inclusive alternatives, without the sacrifice of autonomy that a comparably broad compulsory programme would require. Also, the herd immunity that it would likely generate would protect those who remain unvaccinated, a major advantage from a justice perspective. However, there is a possibility that a HPV vaccination programme targeting all adolescents of both sexes is not considered sufficiently cost-effective. Also, it might pose more difficulties for achieving informed consent than comparable vaccination programmes against other diseases. Ultimately, society's choice of HPV vaccination strategy requires careful consideration not only of the values at stake but also of available and emerging scientific evidence."

There have been definitive, randomized, controlled lung-cancer chemoprevention trials in the three chemoprevention trial settings: primary (healthy high-risk [eg, smokers]), secondary (premalignant lesions), and tertiary (prevention of second primary tumors in previously treated patients), all of which produced negative (either neutral or harmful) primary end point results. These trials established that lung cancer was not prevented by alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, retinol, retinyl palmitate, N-acetylcysteine, or isotretinoin in smokers. Provocative leads of the definitive trials include the possible activity of isotretinoin in never and former smokers and that of alpha-tocopherol in prostate cancer prevention. A major area of lung cancer research is molecular epidemiologic study of highest smoking-related risk based on the interactions between tobacco carcinogens, genetic polymorphisms involved in activating and detoxifying these carcinogens, and host-cell efficiency in monitoring and repairing tobacco carcinogen-DNA damage. The future of lung cancer chemoprevention will rely heavily on molecular studies of carcinogenesis and drug mechanisms to develop novel chemopreventive targets and drugs, risk markers, and surrogate end point biomarkers; new preclinical drug-testing models; novel imaging techniques for monitoring agent activity; and molecular epidemiologic risk models for identifying the highest-risk current and former smokers."

CADM1 silencing often results from promoter methylation. Here, we determined the extent of CADM1 promoter methylation in cervical (pre)malignant lesions and its relation to anchorage-independent growth and gene silencing to select a CADM1-based methylation marker for identification of women at risk of cervical cancer. Methylation-specific PCRs targeting three regions within the CADM1 promoter were performed on high-risk HPV-containing cell lines, PBMCs, normal cervical smears, and (pre)malignant lesions. CADM1 protein expression in cervical tissues was analysed by immunohistochemistry. All statistical tests were two-sided. Density of methylation was associated with the degree of anchorage-independent growth and CADM1 gene silencing in vitro. In cervical squamous lesions, methylation frequency and density increased with severity of disease. Dense methylation (defined as >or= 2 methylated regions) increased from 5% in normal cervical samples to 30% in CIN3 lesions and 83% in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and was significantly associated with decreased CADM1 protein expression (p < 0.00005). The frequency of dense methylation was significantly higher in >or= CIN3 compared with <or= CIN1 (p = 0.005), as well as in SCCs compared with adenocarcinomas (83% versus 23%; p = 0.002). Detection of dense CADM1 promoter methylation will contribute to the assembly of a valuable marker panel for the triage of high-risk HPV-positive women at risk of >or= CIN3."

The studied subjects, patients who were pathologically diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer yielding positive results for human papillomavirus (HPV) (n=342), were compared to healthy, normal, female controls (n=707). DNA from peripheral blood samples from studied subjects whose GSTP1 specific sequences had been determined by PCR with allele-specific primers were reviewed in comparison with the normal controls. The genetic susceptibility of GSTP1 (11q 13.1) in cervical carcinogenesis was determined by examining the effect of gene and environmental factors by the different histopathologic types of invasive cervical cancers. In assessing polymorphism GSTP1, the percentages of individuals homozygous for the A allele, homozygous for the G allele, and heterozygous for the two alleles were 66.8%, 3.9%, and 29.3%, respectively, in the control group, and 64.3%, 4.1%, and 31.6%, respectively, among in women with cervical cancer. Compared with GSTP1 G allele positive (GA or G/G), the odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) for GSTP1 A/A was 1.0 (0.7 - 1.4) for invasive cervical cancer. However, the risk increased with GSTP1 A/A among ever smokers (3.9, 1.7 - 8.9, p-value=0.0012) compared with GSTP1 G allele positive among nonsmokers. In particular, this risk was higher among women with squamous cell carcinoma (4.7, 2.0 - 10.8, p=0.0003).

In 7 HPV-negative patients, the follow-up biopsies showed no evidence of HSIL or LSIL. Correlation between clinical risk factors and the HPV results demonstrated no significant differences in HPV positivity between the high-risk and low-risk patients. The high sensitivity (100%) and negative predictive rate (100%) in detecting HSIL in our study provide strong evidence that, instead of automatic referral to colposcopy, reflex HPV DNA testing may be used as an alternative triage method for women diagnosed with ASC-H on Thin Prep Pap test, especially for women older than 30 yr of age."

A group of 198 patients surgically treated for low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and 35 age-matched controls were monitored for 18 months at 6-month intervals. The presence of HPV DNA in cervical smears was detected by means of consensus polymerase chain reaction, and serum levels of HPV-specific antibodies to HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 45 were measured. In ten patients positive for HPV type 16 in consecutive samples, the HPV 16 variants were identified using a polymerase chain reaction specific for the long control region. Data regarding demographics, risk factors for cervical cancer, and risks related to HPV exposure were collected through a patient questionnaire. Subjects persistently positive for HPV DNA were more likely to present with cytological and/or colposcopical abnormalities. A higher reactivity to HPV-specific antibodies was observed in these women at the 18-month follow-up visit. All ten patients with HPV 16 infection detected in consecutive samples showed persistence of either the same prototype or the same variant during the follow-up period. Risky sexual behavior and smoking were more common in patients than in controls. Persistent HPV infection as demonstrated by both HPV DNA detection and antibody detection appears to be a risk factor for the recurrence of pathological findings in women after surgery. An individually based approach to surgical treatment is an important factor in the outcome of disease at follow-up."
CD008054,0,19894254,1,Women >or=30 years of age with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) have low positivity rates when cotested for high-risk human papillomavirus: should we reconsider HPV triage for LSIL in older women?,"High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing for colposcopy triage of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) is not recommended because of high positive rates in young women. It remains unclear whether HR-HPV testing may be useful for triage of older women. We compiled HR-HPV data for women aged >or=30 years with LSIL for the period March 1, 2006 to February 28, 2008. Follow-up cervical biopsy information was collected for the period March 1, 2006 to August 15, 2008. We used the Hybrid Capture II test performed on residual material from liquid-based Pap tests. Of 735 women, 254 had HR-HPV testing, and of these 144 had positive HR-HPV results. Among women with positive HR-HPV results 79 underwent biopsy (54.9%) and 11 had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3 (13.9% of women with biopsy follow-up). A total of 481 women did not undergo HR-HPV testing, of whom 192 underwent biopsy (39.9%) and 11 had CIN 2 or 3 (5.7% of biopsied women [P = 0.04]). Among women who tested negative for HR-HPV and had follow-up biopsies, only one had a high grade lesion found (CIN 2). The overall HR-HPV positive rate in tested women >or=30 years old with LSIL was 56.7% if women who had reflex HR-HPV testing for ASC-US are included. The HR-HPV positive rate in residual material from Pap tests interpreted as LSIL was 63.8%. Among women >or=30 years of age with LSIL, CIN 2-3 is significantly more likely in HR-HPV positive women. Relatively few older women with LSIL test positive for HR-HPV. Colposcopy triage using HR-HPV may be justified in this population."
CD008054,0,19191295,0,Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and aneusomy of TERC: assessment of liquid-based cytological preparations.,"The implementation of effective screening programs has decreased the incidence and mortality of cervical carcinoma. However, single screening tests are subjective and carry a significant false-negative rate. Therefore, supplementary tests to support the Papanicolaou (PAP) smear are being developed. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has increased the specificity of the PAP smear, but has high sensitivity rate. This has proven unhelpful in low-grade lesions and in young women. Cervical carcinogenesis is a multifactorial disorder. In addition to exposure to oncogenic HPV, which is regarded as the initiator, there must be a promoter to eventuate in invasive disease. The promoter factor appears to be the acquisition of extra copies of chromosome 3q and has been shown to be a constant recurrence in cervical carcinoma (squamous and adenocarcinomas). The 3q region contains the RNA sequence of the human telomerase gene TERC. Recent studies have shown a strong correlation between high-grade cervical lesions and abnormalities of TERC. This study supports the previous studies and examines the status of the TERC gene in low and high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions, diagnosed on cytology. ASC-H smears are also examined in an attempt to categorize lesions that are more likely to progress. Potentially this may help identify women in need of close clinical follow-up and early treatment."
CD008054,0,14710135,0,Role of human papilloma virus testing in cervical cancer prevention.,"A clear causal relationship has been established between human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and the development of cervical cancer. Genital HPV infection is currently the most common sexually transmitted disease worldwide. The recent 2001 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Consensus Guidelines have included HPV testing for management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities. Clinicians now face the challenge of deciding when to use HPV testing in follow-up of abnormal Pap tests. This article includes updates on HPV, cervical cancer screening, and HPV testing technology. Recommendations for integration of HPV testing into clinical practice are provided."

CD008054,0,8088604,0,DNA content as prognostic factor in cervix carcinoma stage IB-III treated with radiotherapy.,"A prognostic value of DNA content in cervix carcinoma for local recurrence following radiotherapy is suggested by both retro- and prospective studies. The purpose of this study was to confirm these data. Flow cytometry and computerized image cytometry were used to measure DNA content of tumor cells retrospectively in paraffin-embedded archive material from 98 patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix FIGO stage IB-III. All patients were treated with combined megavoltage irradiation and brachytherapy. Minimum follow-up has been 5.1 years. Pelvic recurrence was seen in 10, 26, and 54% of patients with stages IB II, and III, respectively (P = 0.003). DNA content, expressed as DNA index (DI), was not correlated with the FIGO stage (P = 0.25), histopathologic grading (P = 0.26), or age (P = 0.63) at diagnosis in this series. Using univariate analysis pelvic disease-free survival (PDFS) was best predicted by the clinical stage (P = 0.004) and by an age greater than 55 years (P = 0.04) before treatment. PDFS tended to be better for patients with aneuploid tumors (DI > 1.2), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.17). Using Cox's regression model for multivariate analysis, only stage was independently correlated to PDFS (P = 0.009). After stratification for stage, ploidy level was significantly correlated with PDFS in stage II patients (P = 0.04). Overall results suggest aneuploid tumors to be more radiosensitive than diploid tumors in this series."

CD008054,0,9798036,0,External genital warts: report of the American Medical Association Consensus Conference. AMA Expert Panel on External Genital Warts.,"A consensus process was undertaken to describe and evaluate current information and practice regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of patients with external genital warts (EGWs) and their sex partners. This process developed a number of key statements that were based on strong evidence in the literature or reasonable suppositions and opinions of experts. Key statements included the following. In most cases, EGWs can be diagnosed clinically by visual inspection. No one treatment is ideal for all patients or all warts. Women with EGWs and female sex partners of men with EGWs are at increased risk for human papillomavirus-related cervical disease and, like all women, should be screened for cervical cancer. The diagnosis of EGWs in children requires a sexual abuse evaluation. Clinicians who treat EGWs have a responsibility to counsel patients and to provide information about the infectivity, diagnosis, treatment, and natural history of EGWs and general information about sexual health and other sexually transmitted diseases."
CD008054,0,19142526,0,[Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia: a current problem].,"Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is a pathological denomination coined by the International Society for Study of Vulvo-vaginal Diseases (ISSVD) and adopted by the International Society of Gynaecological Pathology (ISGYP) and by the World Health Organization. VIN is a heterogeneous pathological entity with a usual type (warty, basaloid and mixed) and a differentiated type. The incidence of the disease is increasing, especially in young women. The high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, smoking, cervical, vaginal and rectal intraepithelial neoplasia are considered to be high risk factors for development of VIN. There are no specific symptoms or vulvar macroscopic aspects of VIN. However, a clinical lesion is always present. Liberal vulvar biopsies under colposcopy guidance should be done. Patients with diagnosis of VIN harbor an increased risk for vulvar invasive cancer. Surgical excision and laser CO2 vaporization are the most popular therapeutic modalities for VIN treatment, both with high rates of recurrence. A close follow-up of the patients is advised. Topical imiquimod seems to be a promising treatment option. Probably, prophylactic vaccination against HR-HPV will be an important tool for VIN prevention."

CD008054,0,19626616,0,"Genetic diversity of human papillomavirus type 16 E6, E7, and L1 genes in Italian women with different grades of cervical lesions.","High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are risk factors for the development of cervical cancer. HPV 16 is the most common type, being present in about 60% of cervical cancers worldwide. Previous studies have reported upon the association between HPV 16 E6 variants and increased risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer. In this study, the presence of HPV 16 polymorphisms in the E6, E7, and L1 genes was investigated in relation to the presence of high-grade lesions. Sequencing of the E6 gene revealed the presence of nucleotide mutations resulting in 15 amino acid changes. Of these, the G134D and C136R fall within the CXXC zinger finger domain important for p53 binding. In the E7 gene, four nucleotide variations were identified with two leading to the amino acid substitutions L15V and S31R. The L1 gene showed 13 nucleotide changes leading to 11 amino acid substitutions. Among these, the R364C and N367D are located at the base of the HI-loop of the L1 protein, considered to be the immunodominant epitope of HPV 16. No significant relationship between HPV 16 variants and high-grade lesions was found. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all the HPV 16 variants identified belonged to the European lineage, except one which was of the Asian-American lineage. The European-350G variant was detected most frequently (22 of 34, 64.7%). The study provides some new data on the genetic diversity of HPV 16 which may help to understand the oncogenic potential of the virus and to improve management of patients."

CD008054,0,17342094,0,High-risk HPV type-specific clearance rates in cervical screening.,"We assessed clearance rates of 14 high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) types in hrHPV-positive women with normal cytology and borderline/mild dyskaryosis (BMD) in a population-based cervical screening cohort of 44,102 women. The 6-month hrHPV type-specific clearance rates, that is, clearance of the same type as detected at baseline, in women with normal and BMD smears were 43% (95% confidence interval (CI) 39-47) and 29% (95% CI 24-34), respectively. Corresponding 18-month clearance rates were markedly higher, namely 65% (95% CI 60-69) and 41% (95% CI 36-47), respectively. The lowest clearance rates in women with normal cytology were observed for HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, and HPV33. Significantly reduced 18-month clearance rates at a significance level of 1% were observed for HPV16 (49%, 95% CI 41-59) and HPV31 (50%, 95% CI 39-63) in women with normal cytology, and for HPV16 (19%, 95% CI 12-29) in women with BMD. Among women who did not clear hrHPV, women with HPV16 persistence displayed an increased detection rate of >or=CIN3 (normal P<0.0001; BMD, P=0.005). The type-specific differences in clearance rates indicate the potential value of hrHPV genotyping in screening programs. Our data support close surveillance (i.e. referral directly, or within 6 months) of women with HPV16 and are inconclusive for surveillance of women with HPV18, HPV31, and HPV33. For the other hrHPV-positive women, it seems advisable to adopt a conservative management with a long waiting period, as hrHPV clearance is markedly higher after 18 months than after 6 months and the risk for >or=CIN3 is low."
CD008054,0,8159611,0,So-called congenital-infantile fibrosarcoma: does it exist and what is it?,"Congenital-infantile fibrosarcoma (CIFS) is a cellular, mitotically active neoplasm with a paradoxically limited biologic potential in most cases. Its phenotype and proliferative features have been incompletely explored with inconclusive results. We studied the clinical, pathologic, immunohistochemical, and flow cytometric features of 26 cases (16 males, 10 females; 92% of cases detected within the first year life; 11 on extremities, 10 on the trunk, 5 in the head and neck). All displayed interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with focal necrosis, mitoses, and a focal hemangiopericytomatous vascular pattern. Immunohistochemically, 22 of 22 cases were reactive for vimentin. Other markers were present in a minority of cases. Flow cytometry of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue in 10 cases demonstrated moderate to high proliferation activity and diploid DNA content in nine cases. Follow-up of all 26 patients revealed 20 patients alive and well, 15 without evidence of recurrence, and 5 with a small residual mass. Six patients had died of tumor, none had distant metastases. Patients with tumors in the head and neck or deep truncal soft tissues, including mesentery, had a poor prognosis because of local extension. CIFS is a clinically and morphologically homogeneous condition with considerable immunophenotypic diversity. Diploid DNA content in the majority of cases suggests that it may not be a fully expressed sarcoma. The clinicopathologic features are sufficiently distinctive to permit recognition and warrant conservative initial treatment in most cases. ""Fibrosarcoma"" is a term of convenience rather than of nosologic certainty."

CD008054,0,17302188,0,Human papillomavirus vaccine: a new chance to prevent cervical cancer.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a significant source of morbidity and mortality throughout the world and is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. HPV is the primary etiologic agent of cervical cancer and dysplasia. Thus, cervical cancer and other HPV-associated malignancies might be prevented or treated by HPV vaccines. Recent research on the safety and efficacy of candidate prophylactic vaccines against HPV have shown very promising results, with nearly 100% efficacy in preventing the development of persistent infections and cervical dysplasia. Questions remain, however, concerning the duration of protection, vaccine acceptability, and feasibility of vaccine delivery in the developing world. Screening recommendations might also be modified based on the longer-term follow-up data and cost-effectiveness considerations, but some level of screening is likely to be required for decades following the implementation of vaccine programs."
CD008054,0,8291507,0,Case report: transverse myelitis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection.,"Transverse myelitis is a rare complication of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. This article describes a case of a previously healthy patient with a subacute transverse myelopathy. The cerebrospinal fluid showed lymphocytic pleocytosis and protein elevation. A magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated abnormal spinal cord signal intensity over several cervical and thoracic segments, suggesting the diagnosis of transverse myelitis. The patient was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and had a rapid improvement. Serologic studies for other viruses were negative; antibody tests indicated acute EBV infection. It is thought this represents a case of transverse myelitis associated with acute EBV infection. Although a few similar patients have been reported previously, this case is the first where EBV serology suggested the etiology at the time of diagnosis, when EBV antibody titers and polymerase-chain reaction for EBV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid were performed, and when a magnetic resonance imaging scan was used for diagnosis and follow-up."
CD008054,0,15823268,0,Preventing cervical cancer in low-resource settings: how far have we come and what does the future hold?,"The Alliance for Cervical Cancer Prevention (ACCP) came together in 1999 to answer key research questions and to advocate for greater global and national interest in reducing the heavy burden of morbidity and mortality caused by this preventable disease. Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), visual inspection with Lugol's iodine (VILI), and human papillomavirus (HPV) tests have been shown to be viable alternatives to traditional cytology. ACCP experience confirmed that cryotherapy is a safe and effective method that is acceptable to women and can be delivered by a range of health providers, including nonphysicians. Programs can maximize coverage by accommodating local needs and involving community leaders and women in planning and implementation. Advocacy efforts have led to significant policy changes and galvanized support for cervical cancer prevention. Despite the prospect of new HPV vaccines, screening will be needed for at least the next 30-40 years. Our experience has shown that with creativity, flexibility, and well-focused use of resources, the inequitable burden of cervical cancer borne by women in poor countries can be sharply reduced."
CD008054,0,16426912,0,Quantitative determination of human telomerase reverse transcriptase messenger RNA expression in premalignant cervical lesions and correlation with human papillomavirus load.,"Expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) messenger RNA (mRNA) and human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 load were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction and correlated with cytological findings and the presence of HPV infection in cervical specimens. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA expression was evaluated in 15 (20.5%) of 73 specimens of atypical squamous epithelial cells of undetermined significance, in 62 (39.7%) of 156 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSILs), in 49 (96%) of 51 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSILs), and in 9 (20%) of 45 normal samples, whereas viral load was quantified in 52 (89.6%) of 58 samples infected with HPV-16. The mean levels of hTERT mRNA expression were 0.11 in normal tissue, 0.23 in atypical squamous epithelial cells of undetermined significance, 0.75 in LGSILs, and 2.5 in HGSILs. Thus, a significant increase in hTERT mRNA expression was observed with increasing degrees of cervical dysplasia. The HPV-16 load was significantly higher in samples of HGSIL than in those of LGSILs (P < .001). A significant correlation was observed between viral load and quantitative hTERT mRNA expression (r = 0.65; P < .05). Quantitative hTERT mRNA assessment showed 96% sensitivity and 100% negative predictive value for high-grade dysplasia, whereas the specificity and positive predictive value were 72% and 36.2%, respectively. It is suggested that quantitative hTERT has a very high sensitivity and negative predictive value, whereas the observed specificity was moderate, indicating that it cannot be used as a diagnostic marker but may be an adjunct in the management of women with high-grade cervical dysplasia. However, the final diagnosis must rely on the inclusion of clinical evaluation and additional assessment data."

Twenty-seven patients, ranging from 14 to 81 years, with an average age of 50 years were selected. Male/female ratio was 1,7. All but one case were Caucasian. A neck mass was the first symptom in 40% of cases, with a mean diagnostic delay of 17 months. Only 8 cases (23%) did not exhibit neck nodes at the moment of diagnosis. CT and MRI were essential to establish staging: 5 stage I, 7 stage II and 15 stage IV, due to regional extension and/or bone erosion. Radiotherapy was employed in all cases, helped by chemotherapy in 20% of them. With a mean follow-up of 62 months, 5-years survival was 32% (IC 14,06-52,09). Of 27 cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma 4 were differentiated (type I), 2 moderately differentiated (type II) and 22 undifferentiated (type III). While LMP-1 was only expressed by 41% of cases, PCR detected Epstein-Barr virus genome in 26 cases (96%) and in situ hybridization for EBERs was positive in all cases. Thus, all nasopharyngeal carcinomas were related to Epstein-Barr virus. Expression of LMP-1 seemed to worse the prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma."

Numerous optical tools are emerging for non-destructive near real-time early diagnosis of precancerous lesions of the cervix. Non-destructive, real-time imaging modalities have reached pre-commercial status, but high resolution mapping tools are not yet introduced in clinical settings. The NCBI PubMed web page was searched using the keywords 'CIN diagnosis' and the combinations of 'cervix {confocal, optical coherence tomography, ftir, infrared, Raman, vibrational, spectroscopy}'. Suitable titles were identified and their relevant references followed. Challenges in precancer management are discussed. The following tools capable of non-destructive high resolution mapping in a clinical environment were selected: confocal microscopy, optical coherence tomography, IR spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Findings on the clinical performance of these techniques are put into context in order to assist the reader in judging the likely performance of these methods as diagnostic tools.

CD008054,0,19435920,0,Costimulation as a platform for the development of vaccines: a peptide-based vaccine containing a novel form of 4-1BB ligand eradicates established tumors.,"Vaccines represent an attractive treatment modality for the management of cancer primarily because of their specificity and generation of immunologic memory important for controlling recurrences. However, the efficacy of therapeutic vaccines may require formulations that not only generate effective immune responses but also overcome immune evasion mechanisms employed by progressing tumor. Costimulatory molecules play critical roles in modulating innate, adaptive, and regulatory immunity and have potential to serve as effective immunomodulatory components of therapeutic vaccines. In this study, we tested the function of a novel soluble form of 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) costimulatory molecule in modulating innate, adaptive, and regulatory immunity and assessed its therapeutic efficacy in the HPV-16 E7-expressing TC-1 cervical cancer and survivin-expressing 3LL lung carcinoma mouse models. Vaccination with 4-1BBL activated dendritic cells and enhanced antigen uptake, generated CD8(+) T-cell effector/memory responses, and endowed T effector cells refractory to suppression by CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T regulatory cells. Immunization with 4-1BBL in combination with an E7 peptide or survivin protein resulted in eradication of TC-1 and 3LL tumors, respectively. 4-1BBL was more effective than TLR agonists LPS, MPL, and CpG and an agonistic 4-1BB antibody as a component of E7 peptide-based therapeutic vaccine for the generation of immune responses and eradication of TC-1 established tumors in the absence of detectable toxicity. Therapeutic efficacy was associated with reversal of tumor-mediated nonresponsiveness/anergy as well as establishment of long-term CD8(+) T-cell memory. Potent pleiotropic immunomodulatory activities combined with lack of toxicity highlight the potential of 4-1BBL molecule as an effective component of therapeutic cancer vaccines."

In this study, we have examined the potential of MBP-1 as a gene therapeutic candidate in regression of non-small cell lung tumor growth. We have observed that exogenous expression of MBP-1 in NSCLC cells (H1299) induces massive cell death. To determine the gene therapeutic potential of MBP-1, replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expressing MBP-1 was given intratumorally in human lung cancer xenografts in nude mice. Our results showed a significant regression of lung tumor growth and prolonged survival on treatment with MBP-1 compared with the control groups (saline or dl312). Subsequently, the mechanism of MBP-1-mediated H1299 cell death was investigated. Our results suggested that MBP-1 induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in H1299 cells; however, treatment with pan-caspase inhibitor did not protect against MBP-1-induced cell death. Cells transduced with MBP-1 displayed early plasma membrane permeability, mitochondrial damage without cytochrome c release, and extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation, yielding a morphotype that is typical of necrosis. Taken together, this study suggests that MBP-1 expression induces a novel form of necrosis-like cell death and MBP-1 could be a potential gene therapeutic candidate against non-small cell lung tumor growth."
CD008054,0,16595046,0,Population-based enrolment of adolescents in a long-term follow-up trial of human papillomavirus vaccine efficacy.,"We evaluated a study setting for assessment of the long-term vaccine efficacy (VE) of human papillomavirus (HPV) virus-like-particle (VLP) vaccine against cervical carcinoma. A total of 22,412 16- to 17-year old adolescent women from seven cities in Finland were invited by letter to participate in a phase III study of a quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) VLP vaccine, between September 2002 and March 2003. A total of 30,947 18-year old women were invited to participate as unvaccinated controls. These women were asked about their willingness to participate in an HPV vaccination trial and to fill a health questionnaire. These three population-based cohorts of adolescent women, including women vaccinated with HPV vaccine or placebo vaccine and unvaccinated control women, are systematically followed over time. The study cohort database will be linked with the Finnish Cancer Registry using cervical carcinoma in situ (CIS) and invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC) as endpoints. Assuming that the cumulative incidence of CIS and ICC over 15 years is 0.45%, and that there is no loss to follow-up, and power of 80%, the determination of 70% total VE will require 3357 HPV vaccine recipients, 3357 placebo vaccine recipients, and 6714 unvaccinated controls. At the baseline, 2632 (12%) of the invited adolescents volunteered to the phase III vaccination trial, and 6790 (22%) responded to the questionnaire study. During a recruitment period of 10 months, 874 HPV vaccine recipients, 875 placebo recipients and 1919 unvaccinated controls were enrolled. Population-based enrollment of large cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated adolescents for passive registry-based follow-up with cervical carcinoma as the end-point is feasible and currently going on in Finland."
CD008054,0,11436166,0,A clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of 35 anaplastic carcinomas of the pancreas with a review of the literature.,"Anaplastic pancreatic carcinomas are rare tumors, frequently displaying a variety of growth patterns. The literature lacks a comprehensive study of this tumor. Thirty-five cases of anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas diagnosed between 1955 and 1997 were retrieved from the Endocrine Registry at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Histology, immunophenotype, molecular analysis, and patient follow-up were analyzed. The tumors of 10 women and 25 men, aged 34 to 85 years (mean age at presentation, 62.5 years), were studied. Patients had vague symptoms (weight loss, pain, and fatigue, nausea, or vomiting), lasting an average of 13.2 weeks. The tumors, of an average size of 9.2 cm, were usually in the head or tail of the pancreas. The tumors were widely infiltrative, histomorphologically separated into predominantly large, pleomorphic cell, or spindle cell groups. Tumor phagocytosis and necrosis were noted. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed an epithelial origin with at least one epithelial marker in 78% of the tumors. K-ras mutations by sequence analysis were found in eight of 12 cases tested. Surgical biopsy/excision was used in all patients. Twenty-nine of 35 patients died of disease (average, 5.2 months), three died with no evidence of disease (average, 56.9 months), and three patients were alive at last follow-up (average, 94.0 months), one with residual disease. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between patients with and without a K-ras mutation. Anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas usually occurs in the head of the pancreas in older men. The epithelial nature of the pleomorphic cells (giant or spindled) can usually be documented. Patients with K-ras mutations have a shorter survival time, even though the overall prognosis for all anaplastic carcinomas is fatal (93% fatality; average survival, 448 days).

CD008054,0,16482538,0,HPV DNA patterns and disease implications in the follow-up of patients treated for HPV16 high-grade carcinoma in situ.,"Twenty-five patients with high-grade cervical lesions associated with HPV16 infection were studied at the time of surgical treatment and followed up after conization. Before surgical treatment, the following parameters were analyzed: (1) physical status of HPV16 DNA, (2) viral load, (3) cytological presentation confirmed by histological diagnosis, and (4) colposcopy. At the time of conization, (5) margin presentation, and (6) cone biopsy were evaluated. At each stage of the follow-up (7) physical status of HPV16 DNA, (8) viral load, (9) cytological test, and (10) colposcopy were repeated. The correlation between the different parameters was examined. Significant differences in the viral loads were observed between integrated and episomal forms and between the coexisting integrated/episomal forms and the only episomal form, while no statistically significant differences were observed between integrated and coexisting forms. At the first stage of follow-up, 11 of 25 patients analyzed (44%) were negative to HPV DNA cytology and colposcopy tests, 13 of the 25 (52%) were HPV16 DNA negative, 17 (68%) cytology negative, and 20 (80%) colposcopy negative. At the closing stage, 15 of 25 subjects (60%) were negative to all three tests, 16 of the 25 (64%) were HPV16 DNA negative, 19 (76%) cytology negative, and 20 colposcopy negative (80%). These observations suggest that in surgery treated patients the viral clearance at the closing stage of follow-up was unrelated to the HPV DNA physical status and to the viral load before treatment, but was associated significantly with the effectiveness of surgery treatment, in particular with margin cone presentation."

CD008054,0,12478546,0,Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor in head and neck cancer.,"It is well known that growth factors play an important role in normal cell proliferation by means of stimulation of growth factor receptors located on the surface of cells. Tumor cells express high levels of growth factor receptors that can theoretically serve as therapeutic targets in cancer treatment. Tyrosine kinase (type 1) growth factor receptors include the family of erbB receptors. The most extensively studied receptor in the erbB family is the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), also known as erbB1. Studies have shown that overexpression of EGFR is involved in the development and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Blocking this receptor in HNSCC cell lines and animal models inhibits tumor growth. Strategies have been developed to target EGFR, including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitors, ligand-linked immunotoxins, and antisense approaches. Laboratory studies and clinical trials are under way to explore the safety and efficacy of these various approaches in a variety of cancers, including HNSCC. Preliminary results from early phase clinical trials are encouraging and may lead to the incorporation of these EGFR targeting strategies into the management of HNSCC."
CD008054,0,16681731,1,Human papillomavirus testing improves the accuracy of colposcopy in detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"To assess the performance of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and colposcopy in detection of cervical pathology. A series of 389 women referred for colposcopy due to an abnormal Pap smear had cervical swabs analyzed for oncogenic (high-risk [HR]) HPV types using Hybrid Capture II (HC2) assay. Loop electrical excision procedure cone biopsy (88%) or colposcopic biopsy (11%) was used as the gold standard. Of the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) smears, 48% were positive for HR HPV, as compared to 76.3% of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) smears. HR HPV was detected in 66.7% and 90% of patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 and CIN2 (or higher), respectively. The sensitivity of the Pap smear using an ASCUS threshold in detecting high-grade CIN was 94.5% (95% confidence intervals (CI): 91-97%) and that of colposcopy 98.5% (95% CI: 95-99%). The respective specificities were 30% (95% CI: 17-28%) and 35.6% (CI: 29-42%). HC2 test had comparable sensitivity, 90% (95% CI: 85-93%), but higher specificity, 54.3% (95% CI: 47-61%). Combining HC2 test with Pap increased specificity, 66.7% and 41.3% for ASCUS and LSIL cutoff, respectively. The minor-abnormality threshold together with HC2 increased specificity of colposcopy with no changes in sensitivity. High viral load (>100 relative light unit/positive control) was associated with significant disease. HPV DNA testing improves the accuracy of colposcopy in the detection of high-grade CIN in women with ASCUS or LSIL smears."
CD008054,0,15751045,1,Triage using HPV-testing in persistent borderline and mildly dyskaryotic smears: proposal for new guidelines.,"In the Netherlands 2% of cervical smears in the cervical cancer screening program are read as borderline or mildly dyskaryotic cytology (BMD smear). Only in about 10% of these women a high-grade CIN lesion (CIN II-III) is present; therefore referral is for the majority unnecessary. In our study triage with high-risk HPV (hrHPV) testing was used to identify women at risk for development of high-grade CIN lesions after a repeat BMD smear. A ""wait-and-see"" period was incorporated allowing clearance of HPV and regression of the lesion. Women with a low-grade lesion, irrespective of their HPV status, were monitored at 12 months; women with a high-grade lesion were monitored at 6 and 12 months. Fifty-one of the 105 women (49%) were hrHPV negative at baseline; none of them showed progression of the lesion within the first year of follow-up (NPV 100%). High-grade CIN was present in 1 patient who was HPV negative at baseline (2%); she demonstrated regression after 12 months. Nineteen of the hrHPV positive women (35%) demonstrated a high-grade CIN lesion at baseline and 3 cleared hrHPV after 6 months, with a subsequent regression of CIN. Ten women remained hrHPV positive with persistence of high-grade CIN and were eventually treated. At baseline, 35 hrHPV positive women demonstrated a low-grade lesion, 19 remained hrHPV positive after 12 months and 5 developed high-grade CIN. Sixteen out of the 35 cleared the hrHPV infection without progression of the lesion. In conclusion, triage, using hrHPV testing for women with persistent BMD cytology, can select women who are not at risk for development of high-grade CIN. We recommend return to the screening program without referral for colposcopic examination if hrHPV is absent. For hrHPV positive women, a repeat hrHPV test after another 6 months is suggested. Referral is only required if persistence of hrHPV is established."

CD008054,0,17036320,0,Combined human papillomavirus DNA and human papillomavirus-like particle serologic assay to identify women at risk for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"The objective of this study was to assess the utility of a second generation human papillomavirus (HPV) virus-like particle (VLP)-based ELISA as an adjunct to HPV DNA testing to identify women at risk for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Participants provided blood, cervical samples and interviewer-obtained questionnaire information. HPV VLPs for types 16, 18, 33, 45 and 52 were produced using a baculovirus expression system. These highly purified VLPs were used in a polymer-based ELISA test. Cases with biopsy-confirmed CIN (CIN I, n = 237; CIN II, n = 56; CIN III, n = 48) and controls (n = 351) with normal Pap smears were tested for HPV DNA by PCR and serologic response to multiple oncogenic HPV VLPs. 258/341 (76%) of cases and 230/351 (65.5%) of control patients had any type of HPV VLP antibody (OR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.16-2.30). More cases were seropositive than controls for each individual HPV type (p < 0.001 for HPV types 16, 18, 33 and 45; p = 0.06 for HPV 52). Reactivity to an increasing number of different HPV type-specific VLPs are associated with high-grade CIN independent of HPV DNA status. HPV VLP assays may be useful as an adjunct to HPV DNA testing in a subset of patients that needs to be defined by further studies."

Normal primary endocervical and infected HeLa cells surviving infection shared similar morphologic, phenotypic, and divisional patterns that differed drastically from those of uninfected HeLa cells. The number of infected hosts surviving 6-7 days of viral exposure did not change during 3-week follow-up period, and their cyclin E levels suggested that they had been arrested to the G1 phase of the cell cycle by viral stress. Our findings suggest that in addition to apoptosis, nononcogenic viral stress activated the expression of endocervical metaplastic-like motifs in surviving hosts. A mechanism of cell response to nononcogenic viral stress was proposed to explain these findings. We conclude that nononcogenic respiratory viruses specifically target and eliminate abnormal cells ectopically overexpressing appropriate receptors and may complement current treatments of cervical cancer."

CD008054,0,8811018,0,T cell proliferative responses against human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein are most prominent in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia patients with a persistent viral infection.,"T cell proliferative responses against human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 protein were studied in relation to HPV status over time in 51 women originally diagnosed with abnormal cervical cytology and participating in a follow-up study. HPV-16-positive patients were grouped as having either a persistent, a cleared or a fluctuating HPV-16 infection as determined by PCR in consecutive cervical smears up until the moment of testing. Positive proliferative responses against HPV-16 E7 were found in 15/26 patients with a persistent, cleared or fluctuating HPV-16 infection (57.7%). In contrast, 0/15 patients who had been typed HPV-negative during follow-up showed positive responses (P = 0.0005). Further analysis showed positive responses to be more frequent in patients with persistent HPV-16 infections and stable or progressing cervical lesions (8/9 patients reactive, 88.9%) as compared to patients with cleared or fluctuating HPV-16 infections and stable or regressing cervical lesions (7/17, 41.1%, P = 0.04). The relatively strong T cell proliferative responses against HPV-16 E7 observed in patients with a persistent HPV-16 infection and progressive cervical lesions indicate that the effectivity of such responses cannot be predicted and apparently depends on additional factors."

CD008054,0,10585579,0,Chlamydia trachomatis infection as a risk factor for invasive cervical cancer.,"Cervical carcinoma is a sexually transmitted disease most strongly linked with human-papillomavirus (HPV) infection. We conducted a prospective sero-epidemiologic study to evaluate the role of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in the development of cervical carcinoma, with invasive cancer as an end point. A nested case-control study within a cohort of 530000 Nordic women was performed. Linking data files of 3 Nordic serum banks and the cancer registries of Finland, Norway and Sweden identified 182 women with invasive cervical carcinoma diagnosed during a mean follow-up of 5 years after serum sampling. The serum samples of the cases and matched cancer-free controls were analyzed for IgG antibodies to C. trachomatis, C. pneumoniae (a control microbe) and HPV types 16, 18 and 33, as well as for serum cotinine (an indicator of tobacco smoking). Serum antibodies to C. trachomatis were associated with an increased risk for cervical squamous-cell carcinoma (HPV- and smoking-adjusted OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.5). The association remained also after adjustment for smoking both in HPV16-seronegative and -seropositive cases (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.8-5.1; OR, 2.3, 95% CI, 0. 8-7.0 respectively). No such association was found for C. pneumoniae. Our prospective study provides sero-epidemiologic evidence that infection with C. trachomatis confers an increased risk for subsequent development of invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix."
CD008054,0,1571113,0,Diagnosis and management of parotitis.,"Of all the salivary glands, the parotid gland is most commonly affected by an inflammatory process. Infections of the parotid gland range from acute to severe. Assessment of the disease process should differentiate local primary parotid infection from systemic infection when this gland is also involved as part of a generalized inflammatory condition. Viral parotitis can be caused by paramyxovirus (mumps), Epstein-Barr virus, coxsackievirus, and influenza A and parainfluenza viruses. Acute suppurative parotitis is generally caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, and rarely, gram-negative bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria, mostly Peptostreptococcus species and Bacteroides species, and pigmented Porphyromonas species and Prevotella species have been recently recognized as an important cause of this infection. beta-Lactamase-producing organisms can be isolated in almost three fourths of the patients. Predisposing factors to suppurative infections are dehydration, malnutrition, oral neoplasms, immunosuppuration, sialolithiasis, and medications that diminish salivation. Pus, aspirated from a suppurative parotic abscess, should be plated on media that are supportive for the growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Early and proper antimicrobial therapy may prevent suppuration. Initial empiric therapy that is directed against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria may be required until a specific causal diagnosis is available. Surgical drainage may be indicated when pus has formed. This may prevent complications and facilitate recovery."
CD008054,0,8382513,1,Use of semi-quantitative PCR for human papillomavirus DNA type 16 to identify women with high grade cervical disease in a population presenting with a mildly dyskaryotic smear report.,"The aim of this study was to assess whether qualitative or semi-quantitative detection of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) can help to identify women with major grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2 and CIN 3) among those referred with a smear suggesting mild dyskaryosis. The study population consisted of 200 women sequentially attending the Royal Free Hospital colposcopy clinic. All women were investigated by cytology, colposcopy and, where appropriate, histopathology, and HPV 16 DNA was detected in cervical scrape samples using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A final clinical diagnosis of normal, wart virus infected (WVI), CIN 1, CIN 2 or CIN 3 was made in 179 women. On the basis of the qualitative PCR data, the presence of HPV 16 DNA was of borderline use in identifying women with high grade cervical disease [63/113 (normal/WVI/CIN 1) vs 46/66 (CIN 2/CIN 3); P = 0.065]. However, semi-quantitative PCR analysis showed that a high/medium HPV 16 result was significantly associated with high-grade disease [29/113 (normal/WVI/CIN 1) vs 38/66 (CIN 2/CIN 3); P = 0.0001]. Furthermore, semi-quantitative PCR and cytology were performed on the repeat smear taken immediately prior to colposcopy. The combined laboratory results show that 53/60 women with biopsy proven high-grade disease were identified, as were 26/95 women who were either normal or who had low grade cervical disease. The possibility of using such an approach for selecting women for more rapid or for routine colposcopy appointments in the two groups respectively is discussed."

All women had normal cervical cytology (N = 2905) at baseline and provided a cervical sample for subsequent HPV typing. Among this cohort, 426 women developed SIL (22 HSIL and 404 LSIL), 619 developed atypia, and 1860 remained cytologically normal. Two controls per case were sampled from those who remained normal. PCR-based methods with L1 consensus primers were used to assess high-risk HPV positivity. Having an oncogenic HPV type at baseline was associated with an almost fourfold increased risk of HSIL development (relative risk (RR) = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.5--9.0) and a 70% increased risk of LSIL development (RR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2--2.3%). The association between HPV positivity and SIL development was strongest in the first year of follow-up (RR = 9.2 for HSIL and 2.5 for LSIL development).

A CCB is an almost inexhaustible resource for fundamental and applied biological research. In particular, it can contribute to answering questions on the natural history of HPV infection and HPV-induced lesions and cancers, screening effectiveness, exploration of new biomarkers, and surveillance of the short- and long-term effects of the introduction of HPV vaccination.

The majority (87%) used quantitative survey methodology, and 13% used more explorative qualitative techniques. Convenience samples were used in most cases (74%) and 26% relied on nationally representative samples. Acceptability of a human papillomavirus virus (HPV) vaccine that protects against cervical cancer and genital warts was high in studies conducted among male college students (74%-78%) but lower in a community sample of males (33%). Among mothers of sons, support of HPV vaccination varied widely from 12% to 100%, depending on the mother's ethnicity and type of vaccine, but was generally high for a vaccine that would protect against both genital warts and cervical cancer. Health providers' intention to recommend HPV vaccine to male patients varied by patient age but was high (82%-92%) for older adolescent patients. A preference to vaccinate females over males was reported in a majority of studies among parents and health care providers.

CD008054,0,15150605,0,Negative human papillomavirus testing in normal smears selects a population at low risk for developing high-grade cervical lesions.,"High-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPV) are the necessary cause of cervical carcinomas and there is an increasing interest in using HR-HPV DNA detection in adjunction to cytological examination for primary cervical screening. To determine whether women with a normal smear negative for HR-HPV DNA detection with the Hybrid Capture II assay might represent a low-risk population for developing a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), 4401 women have been followed in a period of 12-72 months (median=34 months). During this follow-up, four HSIL and one microinvasive carcinoma have been detected in this cohort (three in the cohort of 3526 women >29 years). The global negative predictive value (NPV) of double-negative tests is thus of 99.9% (ninety-five percent confidence interval (95% CI): 99.8-100%), whereas cytology alone gives an NPV of 99.2% (95% CI: 98.9-99.5%). If we obtain a second negative HR-HPV test 1-2 years after the initial test, the NPV is 100%. The NPV is also of 100% in the cohort of women >49 years. We conclude that all these women could be safely screened at longer intervals between 3 and 5 years. This policy will offset the increased costs induced by an additional HR-HPV testing in primary screening."

CD008054,0,17705820,0,Barriers to adoption of recent technology in cervical screening.,"The Pap smear is one of the modern success stories in the field of preventive medicine. Since its introduction as a screening test, there has been a dramatic reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer. However, the search for a better screening test continues. The new technologies, including liquid-based cytology (LBC), Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing and automated or machine-assisted screening have been introduced. However, there is continuous debate about whether society's limited resources are better spent on reaching the underserved rather than on these technologies. Another question is whether these technologies create yet another kind of disparity in delivering preventive care. For example, despite the wide use of LBC (99% of tests submitted to our laboratory are LBC), conventional Pap smears are still used to screen/follow up some women. It is not clear why some providers continue to prefer conventional smear over LBC and what are the barriers for adopting LBC in cervical cancer screening. We hypothesize the lower cost of conventional compared to LBC Pap testing, patient's lower socio-economic indices, a patient's medical history and provider's subspecialty/training all appear to play a role in the choice of using conventional Pap testing rather than LBC. Unintentionally, this choice results in repeat testing, delayed treatment and potentially higher costs than intended. The ultimate goal of this review article is to understand and explore possible barriers and disparities to adopting new technology in cancer screening."

CD008054,0,17893883,0,Human papillomavirus genotype distribution in high grade cervical lesions (CIN 2/3) in France: EDITH study.,"High grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3) have a high potential to progress to invasive cervical cancer (ICC). Pap testing including follow-up and treatment of CIN 2/3 is currently the best prevention of ICC, but is associated with morbidity, namely obstetrical adverse effects and psychological distress. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is universally accepted as the necessary cause of ICC. The objective of the present study was to describe the type-specific prevalence of HPV in CIN 2/3 in France and hereby to locally estimate the potential benefit of an HPV 16/18 L1 virus-like particles (VLP) vaccine. A total of 493 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded CIN 2/3 specimens were analyzed. Medical records were examined for patient related data. HPV were genotyped with the INNO-LiPA assay allowing the detection of 24 HPV genotypes. The overall prevalence of LiPA detectable HPV was 98%. The most prevalent genotype was HPV 16 (62%) followed by HPV 31 (15%), 33 (12%), 52 (9%), 51 (8%), 58 (7%), 35 and 18 (4%). Multiple infection with at least two different high-risk (HR) HPV genotypes was observed in 26% of all specimens including 2.6% with HPV 16 and 18 multiple infections. The present study indicates that HPV 16 is by far the most common HPV type associated with CIN 2/3 in France. With an HPV 16 and 18 prevalence of 64%, HPV 16/18 L1 VLP vaccines would be expected to significantly reduce the burden associated with the management and treatment of CIN 2/3 in France."

CD008054,0,18537160,0,Breast cancer and microbial cancer incidence in female populations around the world: a surprising hyperbolic association.,"Current literature on cancer epidemiology typically discusses etiology of cancer by cancer type. Risks of different cancer types are, however, correlated at population level and may provide etiological clues. We showed previously an unexpected very high positive correlation between breast cancer (BC) and young-adult Hodgkin disease incidence rates. In a population-based case-control study of BC, older ages at the first Epstein-Barr virus exposure, indicated by older ages at onset of infectious mononucleosis, were associated with elevated BC risk. Here we examine BC risk in association with microbial cancer (MC) risk in female populations across the world. MC cancers are cervical, liver and stomach cancers with established causal associations with human papillomaviruses, hepatitis viruses, and helicobacter pylori, respectively. We examined age-adjusted BC and MC incidence rates in 74 female populations around the world with cancer registries. Our analysis suggests that BC and MC rates are inversely associated in a special mathematical form such that the product of BC rate and MC rate is approximately constant across world female populations. A differential equation model with solutions consistent to the observed inverse association was derived. BC and MC rates were modeled as functions of an exposure level to unspecified common factors that influence the 2 rates. In conjunction with previously reported evidence, we submit a hypothesis that BC etiology may have an appreciable link with microbial exposures (and/or immunological responses to them), the lack of which, especially in early life, may elevate BC risk."

A significant analytical inaccuracy of the hc2 near to cut-off was reported recently. To address this problem, 240 samples with repeatedly borderline/equivocal/indeterminate hc2 results (samples with repeated RLU/CO values between 0.4 and 4.0) were tested using the PGMY09/PGMY11 consensus PCR and genotyping in order to resolve their high-risk HPV status. All PGMY09/PGMY11 PCR negative samples were tested in addition using CPI/IIg consensus PCR. A false negative rate of 11.3% and false positive rate of 19.1% were recorded in the samples with repeatedly borderline hc2 results. The corresponding hc2 false reactivity rates in 95 samples selected at random which were clearly hc2 negative (samples with RLU/CO values less than 0.4) and 124 samples selected at random which were clearly hc2 positive (samples with RLU/CO values more than 4.0) were 4.2% and 5.6%, respectively. The proportion of hc2 false reactivity increased with proximity to the hc2 cut-off value. According to the results of the present study, the introduction of an hc2 grey-zone and retesting of samples with repeatedly borderline hc2 results by an alternate HPV detection method, such as the PGMY09/PGMY11 consensus PCR and genotyping, is recommended."

CD008054,0,12496691,0,Symposium part 2: Should the Bethesda System terminology be used in diagnostic surgical pathology?: Counterpoint.,"The criteria currently used for grading cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) are arbitrary and subjective with consequent considerable intra- and interobserver variability. None of the currently used criteria make a clear-cut case for changing terminology. The combination of CIN 2 and CIN 3 into a high-grade lesion is not supported by biologic behavior or HPV typing and leads to overtreatment. The various shifts in nomenclature over the last 50 years through the dysplasia, CIN, and Bethesda systems, although intellectually stimulating, have neither improved diagnostic accuracy nor patient management. On the contrary, they often caused confusion and duplication, leading to the common and ironic practice that several terminologies are now being used in an additive fashion. New diagnostic markers are on the horizon as a result of the rapid development in the areas of genomics and proteomics. It seems likely that specific molecular biomarkers will become available, allowing the consistent and accurate discrimination between those intraepithelial lesions that will ultimately become invasive from the vast majority of lesions that will regress or persist. It is preferable at this time to maintain the current three-tier system, which is well entrenched and accepted around the world, until a novel approach places the classification of cervical precursor lesions on a new and solid footing. Ideally, we will then have a single-tier system identifying reliably those lesions that have the potential to become invasive."
CD008054,0,12496690,0,Symposium part 1: Should the Bethesda System terminology be used in diagnostic surgical pathology?: Point.,"During the past 50 years, the histologic classification of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) has evolved to incorporate the entire spectrum of genital papillomavirus infections, segregating those lesions with the higher risk of containing prototypic high-risk human papillomavirus types, and recently has meshed with treatment algorithms that include loop electrical excision procedures and follow-up alone. This review describes a classification system that divides CIN into categories of low-grade (CIN 1) and high-grade (CIN 2 and CIN 3). To successfully apply this system, the practitioner must efficiently exclude nonneoplastic entities and base the distinction of CIN 1 from CIN 2/3 on criteria that recognize the effects of viral oncogenes on replicating cells. This is achieved by basing the diagnosis of CIN 1 on uniform polarized epithelial growth, low mitotic index, low mitotic counts, and minimal parabasal cell anisokaryosis and coarse chromatin and CIN 2 on the presence of these features or abnormal mitoses. Simply put, the definition of CIN 2 (or higher) is the presence of atypical immature cells in the biopsy that if seen in a cytologic smear would merit a diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. In essence, a successful two-grade system requires careful application of cytologic criteria in a histologic milieu. This model is illustrated in a set of 25 images that underscore the importance of excluding benign changes (with the appropriate use of biomarkers), segregating unusual variants of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and identifying the morphologic transition to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (CIN 2 or CIN 3) with an acceptable level of reproducibility."
CD008054,0,12117707,0,Human papillomavirus and the long-term risk of cervical neoplasia.,"The risk of cervical neoplasia for women with normal Papanicolaou smears was calculated for those whose smears were human papillomavirus (HPV) positive and those whose smears were HPV negative. Data on 347 cases and controls were analyzed in a population-based, nested case-control study. Cases (n = 77) were women who participated in the Utrecht screening program (1976-1984) in the Netherlands and who developed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 or microinvasive or invasive squamous cervical cancer after having a negative smear (1980-1986). Controls (n = 270) were matched on age (+/-5 years) and follow-up period. DNA was isolated from the Papanicolaou smears and was tested for the presence of HPV DNA by using the ultrasensitive broad-spectrum, general short-fragment polymerase chain reaction. HPV was found in 55 (71%) of the baseline smears of the 77 cases and in 31 (11%) of those of the 270 controls. The age-adjusted odds ratios for developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or microinvasive or invasive cervical cancer were 19.2 (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 10.3, 35.7) for HPV positivity in general, 5.4 (95% CI: 1.5, 19.5) for infection with low-risk HPV genotypes, 24.0 (95% CI: 12.4, 46.4) for high-risk HPV genotypes, and 104.8 (95% CI: 29.5, 372.7) for HPV type 16."

Prospective data on the possible association between folate and cervical cancer have been lacking. There is also a paucity of prospective evidence concerning the possible associations between cervical cancer and vitamin B12, which shares pathways with folate, and homocysteine, a marker of low B vitamin concentrations. A nested case-control study was conducted to prospectively evaluate the associations between cervical cancer and serum concentrations of folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine. Among a community-based cohort of women who donated blood in 1974 for a serum bank in Washington County, Maryland, 39 cases of cervical cancer diagnosed between 1975 and mid-1990 were included in the study (13 cases of invasive cervical cancer and 26 cases of carcinoma in situ). Two controls were matched to each case by age, race, and sex. Stored serum from the cases and controls was assayed for folate, B12, and homocysteine concentrations. For folate, adjusted odds ratios were 1.0, 0.62, and 0.60 for the low to high thirds of the serum concentrations, respectively, a trend in the protective direction that was not statistically significant (P for trend = 0.42). Overall, the results for vitamin B12 tended to mimic those for folate, whereas the associations for homocysteine tended to be in the opposite direction. None of the results of this study were statistically significant, but patterns of the associations are in accord with hypothesized mechanistic pathways concerning B vitamins and cervical cancer."

Apoptotic cell death was predominant after the CDDP treatment, and a significant association was observed between the induction of apoptosis and the CDDP susceptibility. An analysis using a cDNA microarray consisting of 23,040 genes identified 52 genes that showed altered expression patterns between super-sensitive and super-resistant cell lines after the CDDP treatments. Using these 52 genes, we successfully distinguished the super-resistant cell lines from others. Our present results give us valuable clues to better understand the chemosensitivities of such cells to CDDP. This will improve the clinical management of patients with HNSCC."

Some evidence suggests a viral origin on the basis of infection with high-risk oncogenic genotypes of human papilloma viruses (HPV 16/18 and others) and an association with cervical carcinoma. Malignant transformation is rare in bowenoid papulosis. The condition usually shows a good response to immuno-modulatory treatment. In the following we present our first case of successful treatment with imiquimod, a topical immune response modifier which is successfully used in the USA for local treatment of condylomata acuminata. Imiquimod creme (Aldara) proved to be a safe, efficious and practical patient-applied therapeutic option for the treatment of bowenoid papulosis. In view of the oncogenic potential of high-risk HPV infections, irrespective of the treatment used, all patients with bowenoid papulosis and their sexual partners must be included in long-term follow-up and regularly examined for malignant transformation."

All the spindle cell carcinomas were studied using paraffin section immunostains, and we performed ploidy analysis of the sarcomatoid component in 31 patients. Of the 31 patients who underwent their initial treatment at our institution, 25 were men and 6 were women (median age at presentation, 64.6 years). A T1 glottic tumor, usually seen as an exophytic firm mass, was the most common type of tumor observed (16 cases). The spindle cells were nondiploid in 86% of the carcinomas, with positive keratin immunostains in 74%. The median follow-up time was 3.7 years. Recurrence of the tumor after partial or total laryngectomy or pharyngectomy occurred in 10 patients. Eight patients died of their disease. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of surviving at least 3 years after initial treatment was 56.8%. Keratin positivity adversely affected the overall survival rate (p < 0.02). The survival rate of patients with hypopharyngeal tumors was worse than that of patients with laryngeal lesions (p < 0.001). The presence of keratin positivity and nondiploid DNA content in the spindle cell population supports the neoplastic epithelial origin of these tumors (sarcomatoid carcinoma). The overall tumor behavior and surgical therapy appeared to be comparable with those of squamous cell carcinomas at a similar stage."

This study was conducted to determine the type-specific HPV persistence and risk factors for persistence of high-risk HPV infections in a large cohort of Danish women. The study was based on a population-based prospective cohort study of women aged 20-29 years. Participants were interviewed and underwent two gynecological examinations 2 years apart. Women with Hybrid Capture 2 results at enrolment and a follow-up visit were included in the analysis (n = 7,418). Persistence was defined as positivity for the same high-risk HPV type at both examinations. Overall, 4.2% of the women had persistent HPV infection, accounting for 26.9% of the initially HPV-positive women. HPV 16, HPV 58, and HPV 31, all from species group alpha 9, were the most persistent types; however, other high-risk HPV types that are detected rarely in cancer cases were also likely to persist. The number of high-risk HPV types and detection of HPV 16 infection at baseline and ever use of oral contraceptives increased the risk for persistence. The risk factor analyses also showed that use of an intrauterine device decreased the risk for persistent high-risk HPV infection among women with one high-risk HPV type at baseline. No association was found with viral load or smoking. In conclusion, persistent high-risk HPV infection, especially HPV 16 persistence, was common among women positive for high-risk HPV."

Twenty-four volunteers underwent an ectocervical biopsy, Pap smear, tests for sexually transmitted infections including HIV and HPV genotyping. All answered a questionnaire regarding medical history. Repeat Pap smear and HPV genotyping was performed 9-26 months later. Quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT-)PCR was used to assess expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD27, IL-2, IL-12, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, HLA-DRÎ±, TGFÎ², IFNÎ³, PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, LAG3, IgA, IgG, CCR5, CCL5/RANTES and the IL-7 receptor in the biopsies. Eleven of 24 volunteers were HPV DNA-positive at baseline. Four of 10 were infected with a persistent HPV genotype at follow-up. All target molecules were successfully amplified and quantified except for IL-4. We found no difference in mRNA expression of these molecules when comparing HPV DNA-positive and -negative women, neither when comparing persistently infected individuals or those who cleared the infection. However, mRNA expression of the B cell phenotypic marker CD19 was higher in women using hormonal contraception than those not (p<0.05). HPV infection does not evoke a local inflammatory immune response in the ectocervix measurable with qRT-PCR. Hormonal contraception may influence B cell activity in the cervix."

The management of cases with such smears could be improved if additional morphological features were found to be indicative of low/high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Our own experience in the routine audit of the diagnostic accuracy of cervical smears had suggested that cases of dyskaryosis with koilcytosis were associated with low risk of CINIII. Two hundred and forty-four cervical smears reported as showing evidence of warty virus infection were reviewed and their subsequent histories noted. Of these smears, 173 demonstrated clear evidence of koilocytosis. Irrespective of the initial grade of dyskaryosis, only 28 cases (16.2%) had underlying CIN or had progressed to CIN over a minimum follow-up period of 21 months. Only two cases (1.2%) showed evidence of CINIII. Koilcytosis is associated with a low risk of CIN and an especially low risk of CINIII.

Only 8% of patients died with recurrent disease after surgery. Patients with stage IA borderline tumors with mucinous histology tended to recur later and carried a poorer prognosis than patients with serous histology and similar stage. The group at highest risk for relapse were age greater than 70, stage II or III tumors, and histology other than serous. Long-term survival in this group was less than 75%. This high-risk group of patients should be targeted for innovative adjuvant treatment strategies. This year several well-designed studies with large sample sizes showed DNA ploidy to be an important new independent prognostic factor in stage I ovarian carcinoma. In patients with well-differentiated early stage ovarian cancer, DNA flow cytometric analysis may indicate subgroups with less favorable prognostic characteristics. This method of analysis may be beneficial in determining the need for additional treatments after surgery for early stage ovarian carcinoma. Recommendations for the definitive management of early stage ovarian cancer awaits completion of current GOG and European randomized prospective studies. Paclitaxel given in combination with platinum-containing agents is an intense area of research for treatment of advanced stage disease. Early data from a prospective randomized trial of patients with advanced ovarian cancer showed a higher response rate and longer disease-free survival in patients treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin compared to a standard regimen of cyclophosphamide and cisplatin. The impact of this treatment on long-term survival awaits maturation of data. Preliminary results evaluating G-CSF in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin for dose escalation was reported. Paclitaxel, 250 mg/m2, and cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, were the maximally tolerated doses, with peripheral neuropathy or myalgias the dose limiting toxicities. Further studies are now underway to test the effect of dose-response with escalation therapies and to determine the optimal dose and schedule for the management of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. IL-3 significantly ameliorated neutropenia but did not prevent cumulative platelet toxicity in a regimen utilizing high-dose carboplatin. This mild improvement in myelosuppression was obtained at the cost of significant toxicity. Nausea, vomiting, malaise, bone pain, headache, fever, chills and facial flushing were frequent. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy was tested as a means of consolidation treatment for patients after having a negative second-look laparotomy. These treatments were shown to be feasible; however, prospective randomized trials will be necessary to determine a benefit over operative therapy alone. Several studies addressed to problem of residual disease after primary surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. A large phase II study conducted by the GOG confirmed the activity of salvage cisplatin-based intraperitoneal chemotherapy in patients with small-volume residual ovarian cancer with favorable pretreatment characteristics. Whether intraperitoneal platinum-based therapy represents an advantage over systemic platinum therapy is being addressed in a prospective SWOG study. The use of six additional cycles of CAP for treatment of residual disease after primary treatment of surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve complete pathological response and survival. Prolonged duration of chemotherapy above six cycles is not likely to impact treatment for residual disease. A regimen of high dose carboplatin was compared to whole abdominal radiotherapy for treatment of residual disease after initial chemotherapy. There was no difference in survival or disease-free survival between treatments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"

CD008054,0,8034500,0,Human papillomaviruses and the diagnosis of genital microorganisms.,"Considerable evidence points to certain types of human papillomaviruses (HPV) as high risk factors in the malignant progression mechanism in lesions of the lower genital tract. Since infection of the genital mucosa by papillomaviruses includes a wide variety of viral types, it is essential to recognize the specific HPV type eventually present in a genital lesion to ensure an appropriate follow-up of the patient. We have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay which differentiates in a single amplification reaction the ""malignant"" HPV genital types from the ""benign"" ones. We report also the use of PCR for the detection of other frequent sexually transmitted agents, such as herpes simplex virus and Chlamydia trachomatis. We show that it is possible to design and use a PCR-based assay for the simultaneous detection of various genital agents from a single genital swab. This assay can be a model for the development of additional multidetection systems of microorganisms potentially involved in similar pathologies."
CD008054,0,15584047,0,p16(INK4A) is a surrogate biomarker for a subset of human papilloma virus-associated dysplasias of the uterine cervix as determined on the Pap smear.,"Recently, p16(INK4A) has been identified as a biomarker for human papilloma virus (HPV)-induced dysplastic lesions of the cervix and it has been suggested that it may be a useful diagnostic aid for these lesions. This study therefore was performed to determine the utility of p16 expression in a series of Papanicolaou (Pap) smears collected in liquid medium and to determine its benefit, if any, over HPV testing. One hundred seven cases, including 23 negative cases, 34 with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 16 with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), 29 with atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASC-US), and 5 cases with ASC suspicious for HSIL (ASC-H), were evaluated for both p16 expression and HPV DNA. We observed p16 expression in only 36% of all cases with abnormal cytology (30/84) and in 40% of all cases associated with high-risk HPV. The highest rate of positivity (80%) and the highest levels of expression (more than three to five positive cells/10x field) were seen in HSIL. Similar results were observed with ASC-H cases. This suggests that in equivocal cases, p16 may be used for confirmation of the diagnosis. On the other hand, p16 positivity was noted in only 21% of LSIL and ASC-US cases. This raises the interesting possibility, given that only a minority of LSIL cases progress on to higher-grade lesions, that p16 might be useful for triaging these patients for closer follow-up and/or further evaluation. Additional studies are required for confirmation."
CD008054,0,17904957,0,2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical cancer screening tests.,"A group of 146 experts representing 29 organizations and professional societies met September 18-19, 2006, in Bethesda, MD, to develop revised evidence-based, consensus guidelines for managing women with abnormal cervical cancer screening tests. Recommendations for managing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) are essentially unchanged. Changes were made for managing these conditions in adolescents for whom cytological follow-up for 2 years was approved. Recommendations for managing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and atypical glandular cells (AGC) also underwent only minor modifications. More emphasis is placed on immediate screen-and-treat approaches for HSIL. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is incorporated into the management of AGC after their initial evaluation with colposcopy and endometrial sampling. The 2004 Interim Guidance for HPV testing as an adjunct to cervical cytology for screening in women 30 years of age and older was formally adopted with only very minor modifications."
CD008054,0,17904958,0,Risk assessment to guide the prevention of cervical cancer.,"Advances in screening and diagnosis make it increasingly possible to prevent cervical cancer. However, if misused or poorly understood, these new tools will only increase costs and potentially harm patients without benefit. As a framework for standardized care that maximizes patient safety and well-being, we propose that a risk model be adopted to guide clinical management now and in the future. The model would use thresholds of increasing risk for cervical precancer and treatable cancer to guide clinical decision making for screening intensity, diagnostic evaluation, or treatment. Experts would decide on these risk thresholds and stratum based on the patient risk to benefit, independent of current (eg, cytology, carcinogenic HPV testing, and colposcopy) and future methods of measuring risk. A risk management model for cervical cancer prevention, based on appropriate clinical actions that correspond to risk stratum, can result in better allocation of resources to and increased safety for women at the greatest risk and increased well-being for women at the lowest risk."

CD008054,0,9197477,0,Potential biomarkers in predicting progression of epithelial hyperplastic lesions of the larynx.,"Factors contributing to malignant transformation of laryngeal pre-neoplastic lesions remain largely unknown. Potential etiologic factors may be related to a genetically controlled sensitivity to environmental carcinogens. In this study, we investigated bleomycin-induced chromosome fragility in 15 patients with laryngeal keratoses who experienced a malignant transformation of pre-neoplastic lesions during follow-up, as compared with chromosome fragility in 15 historical controls with no progression of laryngeal keratoses during a 10-year follow-up, in a match-paired analysis. Chromosomal analysis demonstrated a higher sensitivity to clastogens in patients with malignant progression of laryngeal pre-neoplastic lesions than that of control patients with no evolution of their original laryngeal keratoses (p < 0.01). Furthermore, in the attempt to identify possible prognostic markers we studied proliferative activity (MIB-1 expression) and p53 gene aberration in biopsy samples from non-invasive and invasive laryngeal lesions in both groups. p53 immunostaining was observed in 10/15 (66.7%) of pre-neoplastic lesions and in 11/15 (73.3%) of metachronous laryngeal cancers. No differences in terms of p53 expression were noted between transformed and not-transformed lesions. Mutations at p53 gene were observed in 3/15 (20%) of pre-invasive biopsies and in 4/5 (80%) of the laryngeal cancers analyzed. Our data suggest that p53 alteration is an early event in the genesis of a subset of laryngeal carcinomas and that there is no conclusive data about the possible clonal development of metachronous laryngeal carcinoma from a p53 mutated pre-invasive disease in the same patient. MIB-1 expression was found to progressively increase with degree of epithelial hyperplasia and dysplasia in both transformed (p = 0.007) and not-transformed (p < 0.1) lesions. Surprisingly, pre-invasive lesions with tumor evolution showed a lower proliferative activity when compared with laryngeal lesions without malignant transformation (p = 0.013). These data suggests that subjects with pre-neoplastic laryngeal lesion showing an increased susceptibility to carcinogens and with less proliferative disease could be at a higher risk for development of laryngeal carcinoma."

CD008054,0,15896321,0,Two L1-peptides are excellent tools for serological detection of HPV-associated cervical carcinoma lesions.,"A persistent high risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection causes cervical intraepithelial lesions and cervical carcinoma. There is evidence that detecting anti-L1 antibodies could be successfully used for discriminating between cervical lesion patients and women having normal cytology. It was found that peptides 18283 (55PNNNKILVPKVSGLQYRVFR74) and 18294 (284LYIKGSGSTANLASSNYFPT300) from the L1-surface exposed regions were specifically recognised by antibodies from the cervical lesion patient sera. These peptides were tested against 165 womens' normal cytology sera and 148 cervical lesion or cervical cancer patients' sera. Less than 3.6% of women's normal cytology sera recognised peptides 18283 or 18294; on the contrary, 91% to 96% of the cervical lesion (CIN I to CIN III) or cervical cancer patient sera recognised peptides 18283 and 18294. These data show that anti-peptide 18283 and 18294 antibodies in the patients' sera are strongly associated with the presence of HR-HPV associated cervical lesions, showing 92-97% sensitivity and 89-95% specificity in recognising precancerous and cervical cancer patients. These two peptides could be excellent tools for use in large-scale serological screening of women populations at risk of developing cervical carcinoma."
CD008054,0,9829743,0,Loss of heterozygosity at 11q23 in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is associated with recurrent disease.,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 11q23 has been found in a variety of epithelial human neoplasms, suggesting that this region contains a tumor suppressor gene(s) important to tumorigenesis. We investigated whether LOH at 11q23 could be detected in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), and whether loss at this site was associated with specific clinical parameters. Fifty-six matched blood and SCCHN tumor samples taken at the time of diagnosis were evaluated for LOH at three microsatellite markers at 11q23. Multiplex PCRs with [alpha-32P]dCTP labeling of the amplified DNA strands were performed. Clinical data were obtained from medical record review. LOH at 11q23 was found in 13 of 52 (25%) evaluable tumors. There was no association between LOH at 11q23 and amplification of the CCND1 (cyclin D1) oncogene or inactivation of the p53 gene, which had been determined previously. With a mean follow-up of 24 months, an association independent of tumor size or stage was found between LOH at 11q23 and recurrent disease (P = 0.04). Among subjects who received radiotherapy (RT) as a component of their treatment, LOH at 11q23 was associated with persistent or recurrent locoregional disease (P = 0.05). LOH at 11q23 occurs in a subset of SCCHN. It is associated with a higher likelihood of recurrent disease, perhaps related to resistance to RT. The specific gene(s) and mechanism(s) responsible remain to be identified. Until then, LOH at 11q23 might become a marker identifying patients likely to do poorly with conventional therapy."
CD008054,0,16007672,1,HPV DNA testing in the triage of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS): cost comparison of two methods.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing for triage of cervical cytologies showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) has become the standard of practice. Currently, Hybrid Capture II (HCII) is the preferred method for ASCUS triage. In situ hybridization for HPV represents an alternative to HCII and appears to have a superior specificity but is more expensive. We compare the reimbursement rates of ASCUS triage (HPV high risk) using the methods of HCII and INFORM (in situ hybridization for HPV) in a series of 431 ASCUS patients. The patients were followed for 1 yr, during which each patient had either colposcopic biopsy or follow-up cervical cytology after ASCUS HPV DNA triage. Eighty-nine patients were excluded from the analysis because of incomplete follow-up. The HPV triage percentages, colposcopic biopsy positivity rates and cervical cytology positivity percentages were calculated for each method. The reimbursement rates of the tests/procedures used in the analysis were those in effect at the University of Utah in 2003. The total triage and follow-up reimbursement costs were calculated for HCII and INFORM and compared.HCII referred 19.9% of patients to colposcopy, with a biopsy positivity rate of 25.6% for dysplasia. INFORM referred 11.8% of patients to colposcopy, of whom 34% had a biopsy diagnosis of dysplasia. HCII negative cases revealed 19% to have ASCUS or higher on the follow-up cervical cytology, while 19.9% of INFORM negative cases had a reading of ASCUS or higher at follow-up cytologic examination. The 1-yr HPV DNA triage and follow-up reimbursements for HCII were 316,942.00 US dollars per 1,000 women, and for the INFORM methodology, the reimbursements were 369,484.00 US dollars per 1,000 women. The INFORM method was associated with higher specificity and sent fewer (41%) patients to colposcopy than did HCII. Although this smaller referral rate reduced reimbursement costs associated with colposcopy, the increased reimbursement paid for follow-up cytologies and office visits of HPV DNA negative patient and the greater cost of the INFORM test results in higher overall reimbursement for INFORM. Based on these costs and diagnostic accuracies, it appears that the INFORM HPV technology represents a viable option to HCII ASCUS triage. INFORM HPV appears to be 16% more expensive than HCII but has the advantage of sending 41% fewer women to colposcopy."

There are different approaches to cervical screening in different health authorities in the UK and worldwide due to different funding and healthcare provision in general, the official disease prevalence and the attempt to tailor the screening programme according to a perceived risk for the population covered, but most of all in the diverse evidence provided to aid the development of a screening programme. The advent of high active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may also have altered the natural history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) before it became sufficiently understood and future studies have to take this into account when investigating the impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) and CIN on the risk of developing cervical cancer.

CD008054,0,18792100,0,Test positivity cutoff level of a high risk human papillomavirus test could be increased in routine cervical cancer screening.,"We present data on test positivity, relative sensitivity, rates of detection and relative specificity for primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing with different cutoff levels for test positivity, in comparison to conventional cytology. In 2003-2004, 18,438 women were screened primarily with Hybrid Capture 2 (HC 2) assay, a test for oncogenic HPV DNA, and 21,446 with conventional cytology within the organised screening programme in Finland. A cytological triage test was performed for the HPV positives. Women with cytology equal to low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or worse were referred for colposcopy. The relative sensitivity measured as relative risk (RR) of any cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cancer was 1.58 for the HPV test at the relative light units (rlu) ratio cutoff 1.00, in comparison to cytology. With the cutoff 3.00, all CIN 2+ lesions were detected. With cutoff 10.00, 2 of the 22 CIN 3+ lesions were missed. Relative specificity for HPV screening for any CIN was 92.6% at cutoff 1.00, 94.6% at cutoff 3.00 and 96.3% at cutoff 10.00. For CIN 3+ specificity estimates for these cutoffs were 92.1%, 94.1% and 95.8%, respectively. Used for routine screening as the sole test, the HPV test cutoff can be increased from the level recommended for clinical use. With HC 2, the detection rate at rlu ratio cutoff 10.00 is still at the level of high-quality conventional screening. At that level, the false positive rate is reduced by about half and the specificity of the HPV test becomes equal to the average specificity of conventional cytology."

CD008054,0,19698807,0,The potential cost-effectiveness of adding a human papillomavirus vaccine to the cervical cancer screening programme in South Africa.,"This study was designed to answer the question of whether a cervical cancer prevention programme that incorporates a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is potentially more cost-effective than the current strategy of screening alone in South Africa. We developed a static Markov state transition model to describe the screening and management of cervical cancer within the South African context. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of adding HPV vaccination to the screening programme ranged from US $1078 to 1460 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and US$3320-4495 per life year saved, mainly depending on whether the study was viewed from a health service or a societal perspective. Using discounted costs and benefits, the threshold analysis indicated that a vaccine price reduction of 60% or more would make the vaccine plus screening strategy more cost-effective than the screening only approach. To address the issue of affordability and cost-effectiveness, the pharmaceutical companies need to make a commitment to price reductions."

A nested case-control study within Nordic biobanks.,"The strong correlation between smoking and exposure to oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) has made it difficult to verify the independent role of smoking in cervical carcinogenesis. Thus, the authors evaluated this role. Five large Nordic serum banks containing samples from more than 1,000,000 subjects were linked with nationwide cancer registries (1973-2003). Serum samples were retrieved from 588 women who developed invasive cervical cancer and 2,861 matched controls. The samples were analyzed for cotinine (a biomarker of tobacco exposure) and antibodies to HPV types 16 and 18, herpes simplex virus type 2, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Smoking was associated with the risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) among HPV16- and/or HPV18-seropositive heavy smokers (odds ratio=2.7, 95% confidence interval: 1.7, 4.3). A similar risk of SCC (odds ratio=3.2, 95% confidence interval: 2.6, 4.0) was found in heavy smokers after adjustment for HPV16/18 antibodies. The point estimates increased with increasing age at diagnosis and increasing cotinine level. This study confirms that smoking is an independent risk factor for cervical cancer/SCC in women infected with oncogenic HPVs. These findings emphasize the importance of cervical cancer prevention among women exposed to tobacco smoke."

CD008054,0,12011977,0,Hypericin induced death receptor-mediated apoptosis in photoactivated tumor cells.,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant disease of the head/neck region with a 5-year survival level of approximately 65%. To explore the novel therapeutic strategies in the management of this disease, the potential effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in NPC cells were investigated. PDT, a new mode of treatment, is based on the combined use of light-absorbing compounds and light irradiation. Two human NPC cells such as, poorly differentiated (NPC/CNE2) and moderately differentiated (NPC/TW0-1) and other types of tumor cells like colon (CCL-220.1) and bladder (SD) undergo rapid apoptosis when treated with PDT sensitized with hypericin (HY). It has been shown that this compound has a strong photodynamic effect on tumors and viruses. However, the initiating events of PDT sensitized HY-induced apoptosis are not identified completely. In this study, we sought to determine whether Fas/FasL upregulation and involvement of mitochondrial events are an early event in HY-treated PDT induced apoptosis. Loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c, involvement of caspases 8 and 3 and the status caspase-3 specific substrate PARP, were evaluated in PDT treated tumor cells. Photosensitization of HY enhanced both CD95/CD95L expression and induced CD95-signaling dependent cell death in all tumor cell lines studied. CD95/CD95L expression appeared within 2 h following light irradiation and appeared to be a principal event in PDT induced apoptosis. Furthermore, these results indicate that release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytoplasm within 2-3 h post PDT is a secondary event following the activation of initiator caspase-8 preceding Apaf-1, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, cleavage of PARP and DNA fragmentation."

Folliculotropic MF may be more resistant to superficial therapies because of the depth of the neoplastic T-cells in the follicle."
CD008054,0,7502256,0,[Salivary gland diseases].,"Only about 1% of head and neck tumors are neoplasms of the salivary glands. The majority [80%] of these tumors are benign. Pleomorphic adenomas, the most frequent benign tumors of the salivary glands, can transform into malignancy, especially after a long duration. Treatment of salivary gland tumors consists of complete surgical excision by a surgeon experienced in microsurgery of the facial nerve. Acute suppurative and viral sialadenitis is usually treated by the general practitioner either symptomatically or, if possible, specifically. Chronic sialadenitis, sialadenosis, SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, and Frey's syndrome often need long-term follow-up and medical treatment, which is also usually delivered by the general practitioner, after the diagnosis has been established. Trauma to the salivary gland with transsection of the duct or facial nerve needs immediate microsurgical repair by an otolaryngologist. Sialolithiasis is also treated surgically in most cases."

It is controversial if it is useful to treat the sexual partner. The present study analyzes in a comparative way patients with CIN with treated partner and untreated partner. From 1986 to 1991 251 women treated for CIN, were prospectively studied; they had completed a one year follow up and during this time they presented, or not, treatment failure. Fifty six were examined and their sexual partners were treated for genital papillomavirus, and the control were 195 women, similar to the study group as to age, race, socio-economical level, CIN histological degree, distribution of lesions and therapeutical methods, in whom the male was not examined nor treated. Statistical methods were Umann-Whitney, homogeneity test, and the fractions difference test to compare the groups. It were obtained the persistence and recidive of the treated couple and untreated couple (41% vs 32.8% with P greater than 0.05) not significant, which shows that papillomavirus treatment of the male partner has no effect on CIN treatment failure in the woman. These statistical results should be considered with caution as it is known that the male is a virus reservoir that together with other cofactors may explain the greater risk for the woman to develop CIN."

The tumor was round, firm, mobile, well defined, and located in the left preauricular area. There was no evidence of facial weakness. At operation the left parotid gland was exposed to reveal a tumor arising from the superficial lobe, but involving the facial nerve. Superficial lobectomy was performed followed by reanastomosis using the great auricular nerve for the sacrificed facial nerve. Subsequently, the tumor recurred 13-months after the primary excision. The patient underwent radical neck dissection and was given supplementary radiation therapy. Because DNA-FCM of the tumor showed diploid-type with a large G2/M peak, we regarded radiation therapy as being potentially effective. Follow-up examinations performed two years later revealed no evidence of regional or distant metastases. The histologic examination of the original and the recurrent lesion showed large atypical cells, with abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm, which were often pleomorphic and highly-mitotic.

CD008054,0,15551738,0,P63 expression in lung carcinoma: a tissue microarray study of 408 cases.,"p63 is a recently discovered member of the p53 family that has been shown to be important in the development of epithelial tissues. p63 may also play a role in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, head and neck, and cervix, and its expression is increased in these tumors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of p63 in a broad spectrum of histologic types of lung tumors. A total of 441 cases of primary lung tumors with follow-up data were identified, and the paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were used to construct a duplicate core tissue microarray. After review of the tissue cores, 408 cases, consisting of 123 squamous cell carcinomas, 93 adenocarcinomas, 68 large cell carcinomas, 68 classic carcinoids, 31 atypical carcinoids, 11 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, and 14 small cell carcinomas, were adequate for analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed at 2 different laboratories using monoclonal antibody 4A4 to detect the expression of p63, using different staining protocols. p53 expression was also studied with immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibody DO-7. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to compare the survival of p63-expressing versus nonexpressing tumors. A large proportion of squamous cell carcinomas expressed p63 (96.9%), most showing strong positive nuclear immunoreactivity. Expression in other nonsmall cell lung cancers was also present. Thirty percent of adenocarcinomas and 37% of large cell carcinomas showed p63 expression. In the neuroendocrine tumors, an increasing proportion of tumors stained for p63 as tumor grade increased; 1.9% of classic carcinoids, 30.8% of atypical carcinoids, 50% of large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, and 76.9% of small cell carcinomas were positive. Approximately half of the positively staining neuroendocrine cases showed strong staining. Expression of p63 was of prognostic significance in neuroendocrine tumors (P < 0.0001), with higher-grade tumors more likely to express p63. Correlation between p63 and p53 expression was not observed (P = 0.18) in nonsmall cell lung cancer; however, a significant correlation between the 2 markers was found in neuroendocrine tumors (P < 0.0001). p63 staining was repeated with a different staining protocol, yielding similar results overall but a lower percentage of positive cases (34.2% vs. 48.4% of tumors positive). In conclusion, p63 expression is consistently expressed in squamous cell carcinoma in the lung, but is also expressed in a subset of adenocarcinomas and large cell carcinomas. Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors also show p63 staining in some instances, particularly in higher-grade tumors, and the majority of small cell carcinomas are p63-positive. These results suggest that p63 may be involved in oncogenesis in a broader range of tumors than was previously thought."
CD008054,0,18232728,0,Functions of paracrine PDGF signaling in the proangiogenic tumor stroma revealed by pharmacological targeting.,"Important support functions, including promotion of tumor growth, angiogenesis, and invasion, have been attributed to the different cell types populating the tumor stroma, i.e., endothelial cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, pericytes, and infiltrating inflammatory cells. Fibroblasts have long been recognized inside carcinomas and are increasingly implicated as functional participants. The stroma is prominent in cervical carcinoma, and distinguishable from nonmalignant tissue, suggestive of altered (tumor-promoting) functions. We postulated that pharmacological targeting of putative stromal support functions, in particular those of cancer-associated fibroblasts, could have therapeutic utility, and sought to assess the possibility in a pre-clinical setting."

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of these metabolic gene polymorphisms on the risk of HNSCC. The study population included 294 histologically confirmed HNSCC cases and 333 controls without cancer. Genotyping analysis of the GSTP1 Ile105Val and NQO1 Trp139Arg genes was performed by polymerase chain reaction-based techniques on DNA prepared from peripheral blood. The Mantel-Haenszel chi2 test was used for statistical analysis. The allele frequencies of the GSTP1 and NQO1 polymorphisms were not statistically significant between cases and controls. In analyzing the association between smoking amounts and genetic polymorphisms, GSTP1 and NQO1 polymorphisms were associated with cigarette smoking amounts in cases. G allele containing genotypes in GSTP1 and T allele containing genotypes in NQO1 were associated with a tobacco dose-dependent increase in risk of HNSCC and these genotype distributions were statistically significant (p<0.05). We found that the GSTP1 105Val allele and NQO1 139Arg allele were associated with tobacco dose-dependent increase in risk of HNSCC. GSTP1 and NQO1 genotype polymorphisms may play an important role in the development of smoking related HNSCC."
CD008054,0,18572051,0,The role of infectious agents in the etiology of ocular adnexal neoplasia.,"Given the fact that infectious agents contribute to around 18% of human cancers worldwide, it would seem prudent to explore their role in neoplasms of the ocular adnexa: primary malignancies of the conjunctiva, lacrimal glands, eyelids, and orbit. By elucidating the mechanisms by which infectious agents contribute to oncogenesis, the management, treatment, and prevention of these neoplasms may one day parallel what is already in place for cancers such as cervical cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma. Antibiotic treatment and vaccines against infectious agents may herald a future with a curtailed role for traditional therapies of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Unlike other malignancies for which large epidemiological studies are available, analyzing ocular adnexal neoplasms is challenging as they are relatively rare. Additionally, putative infectious agents seemingly display an immense geographic variation that has led to much debate regarding the relative importance of one organism versus another. This review discusses the pathogenetic role of several microorganisms in different ocular adnexal malignancies, including human papilloma virus in conjunctival papilloma and squamous cell carcinoma, human immunodeficiency virus in conjunctival squamous carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus or human herpes simplex virus-8 (KSHV/HHV-8) in conjunctival Kaposi sarcoma, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori,), Chlamydia, and hepatitis C virus in ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. Unlike cervical cancer where a single infectious agent, human papilloma virus, is found in greater than 99% of lesions, multiple organisms may play a role in the etiology of certain ocular adnexal neoplasms by acting through similar mechanisms of oncogenesis, including chronic antigenic stimulation and the action of infectious oncogenes. However, similar to other human malignancies, ultimately the role of infectious agents in ocular adnexal neoplasms is most likely as a cofactor to genetic and environmental risk factors."

In biopsies from 44 CIN patients (the learning set), subjective CIN grade, onco-HPV by PCR, and Ki-67 immuno-quantitative features were assessed. We followed development of the lesions by colposcopy and cytology, but the final endpoint was the histological grade (again in small biopsies). The outcome was defined as progression (histological (CIN 1 to (CIN 2 or 3)) or CIN 2 to CIN 3) or not (all other cases). Single and multivariate (Cox regression) and survival analyses were applied. The resulting predictive combination of quantitative features was then applied to a new test set of 35 consecutive CIN 2 (small) biopsies followed by large (cone or LLETZ) biopsies. In the learning set, mean follow-up of non-progression cases was 18.8 months (range 4.7-35.9), and of progression cases 13.1 months (range 6.4-32.9) (p = 0.18). Five cases progressed (11%). Of the 16 CIN 1 and 28 CIN 2 lesions, 31 cases (70%) were onco-HPV positive (5 of the CIN 1 and 26 of the CIN 2). The age of women with progression or not did not differ (p = 0.68). All 5 progression cases were CIN 2 (on review, one of these was reclassified as CIN 1), and positive for onco-HPV. Cox regression analysis showed that the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells located in the middle third layer of the epithelium (MIDTHIRD) and the 90th percentile of the stratification index (SI90) was the best combination to predict progression (log rank = 5.1, p = 0.02). Furthermore, sensitivity (100%), specificity (56%), positive predictive value (23%), negative predictive value (100%), and overall percentage correctly classified cases (61%) of this Ki-67 combination were higher than that of subjective CIN grade or HPV status, either single or combined (both for routine and review CIN grades). Adding CIN grade or HPV status did not improve the Ki-67 prognostic results. Application of the prognostic Ki-67 combination to the test set of 35 small biopsies followed by large (cone or LLETZ biopsies) gave comparable results. Analyses on homogeneous subgroups (CIN 2 only, onco-HPV+ only, or CIN2/onco-HPV+ only) gave similar results. In conclusion, Ki-67 immuno-quantitation of small biopsies showing CIN 1 or CIN 2 has strong independent prognostic value for progression."

As a framework for standardized care that maximizes patient safety and well-being, we propose that a risk model be adopted to guide clinical management now and in the future. The model would use thresholds of increasing risk for cervical precancer and treatable cancer to guide clinical decision making for screening intensity, diagnostic evaluation, or treatment. Experts would decide on these risk thresholds and stratum based on the patient risk to benefit, independent of current (e.g., cytology, carcinogenic human papillomavirus testing, and colposcopy) and future methods of measuring risk.

While chlamydia infection has been associated with cervical cancer, the meaning of this association remains unclear. The authors' objective was to investigate this association by evaluating whether concurrent genital tract infections are associated with HPV persistence, a precursor to cervical cancer. Interview data and biologic samples for HPV, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis testing were collected from female adolescents in an Atlanta, Georgia, longitudinal cohort study at 6-month visits (1999-2003). Associations with persistence (detection of the same HPV type at two sequential visits (visit pair)) were assessed among subjects with 2-5 visits and > or =6 months of follow-up. Associations were evaluated by logistic regression using methods for correlated data. Type-specific persistence of high-risk HPV types was detected in 77 of 181 (43%) analyzed visit pairs. Concurrent infection with C. trachomatis was independently associated with persistence of high-risk HPV types (adjusted odds ratio = 2.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.0, 4.1). Infection with more than one HPV type at the initial visit was also associated with high-risk persistence (adjusted odds ratio = 2.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.6, 4.9). The association between chlamydia infection and cervical cancer may be due to an effect of chlamydia infection on persistence of high-risk HPV."

The frequency rate of intraepithelial neoplasia was 1.1% in 7743 Jordanian females and 2916 non-Jordanian residents of younger age during the period from 1982 to 1991 inclusive. The incidence rate in 2649 Jordanian females, selected because they attended only for routine checkup, was 49 per 100,000. There were 121 CIN cases which were graded into Grade I (21%), II (48%) and III (31%) respectively. Histological grading correlated with cytology in 70% of the cases while in the remaining 30%, cytologic underrating by one grade was noted; evidence against any overdiagnosis of CIN in our series. Study of the human papillomavirus (HPV) was outside the scope of this effort. However, circumcision in male partners and marital status were associated with a lower frequency of CIN. Age at marriage and average duration, parity, breast feeding, the contraceptive pill, socioeconomic status and menstrual disorders showed no relationship to the frequency of CIN in our patients. Any differences in the latter between Jordanian and non-Jordanian females are believed due to cultural factors. Conization in 27 cases proved effective at 30 months' follow-up. Occurrence of CIN in Jordanian females appears substantial although much lower than that seen in high incidence zones, while its incidence in the general female population remains to be determined. This study shows for the first time the value of Papanicolaou (Pap) smears in Jordanian females over 20 years of age with special emphasis on those over 35 years of age attending obstetric and gynecology clinics."

Incident cases of in situ or invasive cervical cancer occurring between 1975 and 1990 in a cohort of over 11,000 healthy women in Washington County, MD, were identified. The baseline sera of cases and of matched controls, collected in 1974, were examined for IgG antibodies reactive with virus-like particles of HPV-16, a cancer-associated HPV, and HPV-6, a low-risk HPV. Postdiagnosis sera of 11 cases were also assessed similarly. Fourteen cases of invasive and 28 cases of in situ cervical cancer and 83 matched controls were evaluated. The main outcome measure was the risk of cervical cancer in women who had HPV-16 or HPV-6 antibodies in prediagnostic sera. Antibodies to HPV-16 but not to HPV-6 were a marker for subsequent occurrence of cervical cancer. Case sera were reactive more often and more strongly with HPV-16 virus-like particles than were sera of matched controls. The presence of antibodies to HPV-16 was significantly associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence limits, 1.4, 10.7); high antibody levels to HPV-16 were associated with an even greater risk of cervical cancer (odds ratio = 7.5, 95% confidence limits 1.5, 36.3). The association with cervical cancer was strengthened after adjustment for smoking and years of education. In tests of 11 pairs of pre- and postdiagnostic sera, HPV-16 antibodies did not decline markedly over a 7-13-year time period, and seroconversion to HPV-16 appeared to have occurred in 2 cases. The serological data indicate that HPV-16 infection is associated with future risk of cervical cancer and strengthen the evidence for the etiological role of HPVs in cervical cancer."

These results show the potential for inadequate evaluation of women with HPV(+) ASC-US, as well as unnecessary early repeat cytology in HPV(-) ASC-US patients. Therefore, additional clinician education and reminders to correlate cytology and HPV test results may be warranted to optimize patient care."

CD008054,0,21084266,0,Risk of infection-related cancers after the loss of a child: a follow-up study in Sweden.,"It is unknown whether severe emotional stress due to loss of a child influences the risk of cancers susceptible to immune modulation such as infection-related cancers. We conducted a historic cohort study in 1990 to 2004 on the basis of the Swedish Multi-Generation Register including 4,687,073 parents. Death of a child was identified through the Causes of Death Register. Poisson regression was used to derive the relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of infection-related cancers, comparing the incidence rates of parents who lost a child with those who never lost a child. A total of 101,306 parents (2%) had lost a child during follow-up, among whom 1,608 subsequently developed infection-related cancers. After adjustment for age, sex, calendar year, educational level, and civil status, the overall RR of 14 cancers studied was 1.07 (95% CI: 1.02-1.12). Parents who lost a child were particularly at a higher risk for cancers potentially associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection such as cervical cancer (RR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.17-1.80). Higher RRs for most cancers were obtained within 5 years after child loss and excess risk for liver and stomach cancers was confined to that period. No association was observed for lymphoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer at any time point after child loss. Although potential confounding by unmeasured factors cannot be ruled out, our findings lend support to the hypothesis that severe life stressors, such as child loss, may raise the risk for several, chiefly HPV-related, cancers."
CD008054,0,17848300,0,Strategic plans to promote head and neck cancer translational research within the radiation therapy oncology group: a report from the translational research program.,"Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of approximately 40-50%. In an effort to improve patient outcomes, research efforts designed to maximize benefit and reduce toxicities of therapy are in progress. Basic research in cancer biology has accelerated this endeavor and provided preclinical data and technology to support clinically relevant advances in early detection, prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Recent completion of the Human Genome Project has promoted the rapid development of novel ""omics"" technologies that allow more broad based study from a systems biology perspective. However, clinically relevant application of resultant gene signatures to clinical trials within cooperative groups has advanced slowly. In light of the large numbers of variables intrinsic to biomarker studies, validation of preliminary data for clinical implementation presents a significant challenge and may only be realized with large trials that involve significant patient numbers. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Head and Neck Cancer Translational Research Program recognizes this problem and brings together three unique features to facilitate this research: (1) availability of large numbers of clinical specimens from homogeneously treated patients through multi-institutional clinical trials; (2) a team of physicians, scientists, and staff focused on patient-oriented head-and-neck cancer research with the common goal of improving cancer care; and (3) a funding mechanism through the RTOG Seed Grant Program. In this position paper we outline strategic plans to further promote translational research within the framework of the RTOG."
CD008054,0,16150393,0,Management of cervical premalignant lesions.,"Management of cervical preneoplasia starts with an abnormal smear result. The use of the Bethesda system is recommended. The management of patients with low-grade abnormal smear results varies around the world. Patients with atypical squamous cells on cytology are recommended to be subclassified into atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and atypical squamous cells where high-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions (HSIL) cannot be excluded (ASCH) groups. While patients with ASCUS can be followed with cytology or colposcopy, the risk of having cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) is higher in patients with ASCH. Such patients, as well as those with low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions on cytology, should be referred for colposcopy to ensure that diagnosis and treatment in CIN is detected. Patients with HSIL should be referred promptly for colposcopic assessment. This should, usually at the same clinic visit, be followed by large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ). Although this is effective treatment, around 15% of patients will have persistent/recurrent disease on cytological follow-up. Patients with positive human papillomavirus DNA tests at follow-up seem to have a considerably higher risk of recurrent preneoplasia than those who have negative tests. Patients over 50 years of age have much higher recurrence risks than younger patients. These factors impact on second-line treatment and follow-up schedules. An important benefit of conservative treatment for CIN with LLETZ is retention of fertility. LLETZ is associated with an increased risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes and preterm birth, but not with other adverse pregnancy outcome measures. Conservative excisional management of adenocarcinoma in situ by LLETZ or cold knife cone biopsy is not reported to be as effective as that of CIN, with high risk of residual and recurrent disease at follow-up. Conversely, LLETZ may be acceptable treatment for micro-invasive squamous carcinoma if the excision margins are free of disease and there is no evidence of lymphovascular involvement. The ability to detect and treat premalignant lesions on the cervix reversed the natural history of cervical cancer. Methods of conservative treatment that evolved over decades have been proven safe and effective, allowing retention of fertility. Good clinical guidelines have been developed for most clinical scenarios while some uncertainties persist for other scenarios."
CD008054,0,16150390,0,Human papillomavirus testing and screening.,"Cervical cancer is a largely preventable disease through the detection, treatment and follow-up of its precursors. Traditionally, this has been accomplished through screening women with cervical cytology, and referring women with abnormal cytology for colposcopy, histological sampling and treatment. In organized programmes that achieve wide coverage of the target population at frequent intervals, this approach has resulted in a considerable reduction in cervical cancer. Recently, however, the development of reliable and reproducible tests for the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the cervix (which is now accepted to be causally associated with the development of almost all cervical cancers) has led to the evaluation of HPV de-oxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing as either an alternative or adjunctive test to cytology for the detection of cervical cancer and its precursors. There is now a large body of data supporting the clinical utility of HPV DNA testing for the prevention of cervical cancer, particularly in the settings of primary screening of women older than 30 years, in the triage of women with equivocal cytology and for the follow-up of women post-treatment."
CD008054,0,17627067,0,Therapeutic vaccination for HPV induced cervical cancers.,"Cervical Cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide and is associated with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection, creating a unique opportunity to treat cervical cancer through anti-viral vaccination. Although a prophylactic vaccine may be available within a year, millions of women, already infected, will continue to suffer from HPV-related disease, emphasizing the need to develop therapeutic vaccination strategies. A majority of clinical trials examining therapeutic vaccination have shown limited efficacy due to examining patients with more advanced-stage cancer who tend to have decreased immune function. Current trends in clinical trials with therapeutic agents examine patients with pre-invasive lesions in order to prevent invasive cervical cancer. However, longer follow-up is necessary to correlate immune responses to lesion regression. Meanwhile, preclinical studies in this field include further exploration of peptide or protein vaccination, and the delivery of HPV antigens in DNA-based vaccines or in viral vectors. As long as pre-clinical studies continue to advance, the prospect of therapeutic vaccination to treat existing lesions seem good in the near future. Positive consequences of therapeutic vaccination would include less disfiguring treatment options and fewer instances of recurrent or progressive lesions leading to a reduction in cervical cancer incidence."
CD008054,0,18685007,0,Comparison of GP5+/6+-PCR and SPF10-line blot assays for detection of high-risk human papillomavirus in samples from women with normal cytology results who develop grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Using a case control approach, we performed a two-way comparison study between GP5+/6+-PCR and HPV SPF(10)-Line Blot 25 (SPF(10)) assays for detection of 14 types of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) in samples from women with normal cytology results who had or developed grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 3). Samples were pooled from two cohorts, i.e., women participating in population-based screening and women attending a gynecological outpatient clinic. Cases (n = 45) were women with histologically confirmed CIN 3 diagnosed within a median follow-up time of 2.7 (range, 0.2 to 7.9) years. Control samples were from women (n = 264) who had developed CIN 1 lesions at maximum (median follow-up at 5.8 [range, 0 to 10] years). Identical numbers of cases tested positive for 1 or more of the 14 hrHPV types by both systems (40/45; McNemar; P = 1.0). Conversely, SPF(10) scored significantly more controls as hrHPV positive than did GP5+/6+-PCR (95/264 versus 29/264; McNemar; P < 0.001). Consequently, women with normal cytology results and an hrHPV GP5+/6+-PCR-positive test exhibited a risk of CIN 3 that was 4.5 times higher (odds ratio [OR], 65; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 24 to 178) than that seen for women with an hrHPV-positive SPF(10) test (OR, 14; 95%CI, 5 to 38)). Similar results were obtained after analysis of both cohorts separately. Discrepancy analysis by viral load assessment for the most common discordant hrHPV types (HPV16, -18, and -52) showed that samples which were SPF(10) positive only for these types had viral loads significantly lower than those for samples that were positive by both assays (analysis of variance; P < or = 0.006). Our data indicate that GP5+/6+-PCR has a better clinical performance than SPF(10) for women who are diagnosed with CIN 3 after prior normal cytology results. The extra positivity scored by SPF(10) mainly involved infections characterized by low viral loads that do not result in CIN 3."
CD008054,0,17627065,0,Biomarkers in cervical cancer screening.,"In industrialized countries, population wide cytological screening programs using the Pap test have led to a substantial reduction of the incidence of cervical cancer. Despite this evident success, screening programs that rely on Pap-stained cytological samples have several limitations. First, a number of equivocal or mildly abnormal test results require costly work up by either repeated retesting or direct colposcopy and biopsy, since a certain percentage of high grade lesions that require immediate treatment hide among these unclear test results. This work up of mildly abnormal or equivocal cytological tests consumes a large amount of the overall costs spent for cervical cancer screening. Improved triage of these samples might substantially reduce the costs. Cervical cancer is induced by persistent infections with oncogenic human papilloma viruses (HPV). While HPV infection is an indispensable factor, it is not sufficient to cause cancer. The majority of acute HPV infections induce low grade precursor lesions that are cleared spontaneously after several months in more than 90% of cases, and less than 10% eventually progress to high grade lesions or invasive cancer. Progression is characterized by the deregulated expression of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7 in infected basal and parabasal cells. Novel biomarkers that allow monitoring these essential molecular events in histological or cytological specimens are likely to improve the detection of lesions that have a high risk of progression in both primary screening and triage settings. In this review, we will discuss potential biomarkers for cervical cancer screening with a focus on the level of clinical evidence that supports their application as novel markers in refined cervical cancer screening programs."

HrHPV testing is thought to improve cervical screening algorithms, the management of women with cytologically equivocal smears, and the management of women treated for high grade CIN. In this chapter we discuss different methods for HPV detection and genotyping and their respective applications."

CD008054,0,14522369,0,Nasopharyngeal carcinomas: an update.,"Among the group of head and neck cancers, nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) represent a distinct entity in terms of their epidemiology, clinical presentation, biological markers, carcinogenic risk factors, prognostic factors, treatment and outcome. Undifferentiated NPC (UCNT), the most frequent histological type, is endemic in certain regions, especially in South East Asia. The disease has also been associated with the presence of the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). Although NPC is a radiosensitive and chemosensitive tumour, a substantial number of patients develop local recurrence or distant metastases. For patients with locoregional advanced disease, it is well known that conventional radiotherapy is insufficient in terms of both the local control rates and distant metastases. New techniques of radiation and new combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy modalities have been evaluated in numerous clinical trials in recent years. The purpose of this article is to review the current knowledge in terms of the epidemiology, biology, prognosis, management and outcome of patients with NPC."

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 170 biopsy specimens with diagnoses of CIN II (n = 54) or CIN III (n = 116) were DQB1-typed using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. The follow-up period for cases was 13 to 15 years. The control material comprised blood samples and endocervical brushes from 213 women without CIN. Both cases and controls had previously been human papillomavirus (HPV)-typed. The DQB1*0301 allele was overrepresented among cases compared with controls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8). Presence of CIN was related to HPV infection, and HPV 16 positivity was significantly associated with the presence of DQB1*0301 (OR 1.8). The DQBI*0301 allele was significantly more prevalent in CIN III than in CIN II cases. The lesions in two women recurred in the follow-up period, one of whom was carrying the DQB1*0301 allele. Women carrying the HLA-DQB1*0301 allele have an increased risk of developing CIN when infected by HPV 16, although there was not an increased frequency of recurrent disease among women carrying this allele."

CD008054,0,20161611,0,Advances and Perspectives in the Molecular Diagnosis of Head and Neck Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a debilitating and lethal disease. Despite significant advances in radiotherapy and surgical management, the 5-year survival rate for head and neck cancer has remained a dismal 50%. Advances in early detection have been made, but to improve patient outcomes better biomarkers and targeted therapeutic agents are needed. Novel biomarkers can improve early detection and provide data to optimize therapeutic strategy and patient survival, and could lead to potentially effective targeted therapies. OBJECTIVE: Report the advances in the discovery of novel biomarkers for HNSCC, and review the potential utility of biomarkers in the molecular diagnosis of HNSCC. METHODS: A review of the English literature (PubMed) from 1980 to 2009. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Currently the most widely accepted biomarker for HNSCC is high risk HPV status. EGFR is another promising biomarker, however, further research is necessary to determine its prognostic benefit. A large number of promising biomarker candidates are currently being evaluated including epigenetic, expression, and genomic based markers. Studies to validate the sensitivity and specificity of these biomarkers in clinical samples from adequately powered prospective cohorts are needed for successful translation of these findings into potential molecular diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers for HNSCC."
CD008054,0,15672956,0,The problems with different management options of women with minor squamous intraepithelial lesions in Pap tests.,"The optimum management of women with minor squamous intraepithelial lesions in Pap tests is controversial. With cytological surveillance after one Pap test showing atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), a significant proportion of women will have undiagnosed squamous intraepithelial lesions. On the other hand, using immediate colposcopy for ASCUS almost half of the women would not have needed the procedure. This number for referral for colposcopy can be reduced to only those women who test positive for high-risk HPV-DNA, however some women will have undiagnosed squamous intraepithelial lesions. In addition, when surveillance with repeat Pap tests is used for the management of low-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) a significant number of high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions can be missed. In this article all the problems of each management policy in women with minor squamous intraepithelial lesions in Pap tests are addressed."

In addition, real advances have been made in the application of DNA recombinant technology to cancer therapy and patient management. In gynecologic oncologic fields, there are also many investigations to explore the basic pathogenesis of gynecologic cancer, such as cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer. It is now known that specific types of human papilloma virus (HPV) are the principal etiologic agents for both cervical cancer and its precursors. However, the various kinds of alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes may play additional roles in carcinogenesis of cervical cancer. Although ovarian carcinoma is the most frequent cause of death from gynecologic malignancies, the histogenesis and biological characteristics of these tumors are not well understood. During the last several years, many key observations have been made concerning the genetic alterations associated with ovarian cancer. Recent researches including some dominant oncogenes and tumor suppressor gene mutations common to these malignancies are providing bases to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this cancer. The most important basis of endometrial cancer is that K-ras and p53 mutations are also frequently observed."

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical and biopsy specimens obtained from 59 women were examined. The 59 women were classified into two groups: one of progression cases and the other regression cases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and dot blot hybridization (DBH) were used for the detection of HPV 16/18 DNA, while flow cytometry was used for the analysis of the relative cellular DNA content in samples prepared by Hedley's method. Eight out of 29 progression cases (27.6%) and 3 out of 30 regression cases (10.0%) exhibited HPV 16/18 DNA, whereas 14 out of 29 progression cases (48.3%) and 2 out of 30 regression cases (6.7%) involved a DNA aneuploid population, representing a DNA index in the former above 1.5 and in the latter below 1.5. The proportion of cases having a population of DNA aneuploid together with the presence of HPV 16/18 DNA was 20.7% (6/29) in the progression group and 0% (0/30) in the regression group. These results indicate that the DNA aneuploid population coupled with simultaneous HPV 16, 18 infection may be used as a marker for progression in uterine cervical dysplasia."

A study of 36 cases.,"Chordomas are slow growing malignant neoplasms with a prolonged clinical course which do not usually metastasize. They are histologically benign, locally invasive and often recur following resection. Survival has been shown to vary widely and prognostic indicators have been difficult to identify. Cellularity, mitotic activity and cellular pleomorphism have not been found to have prognostic significance. Thirty-six cases of clival, cervico-thoracic and sacral chordomas were evaluated utilizing four variables as possible predictors of survival: (1) silver nucleolar organizing region (AgNOR), (2) ploidy, (3) fibrosis, and (4) inflammatory response. AgNOR areas in approximately 200 cells per case were calculated and summed. DNA ploidy was obtained in 23 of the cases by analyzing deparaffinized Feulgen-stained tissue. Fibrosis and inflammation were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin and by trichrome stains. Clinical follow-up was available in the 36 cases with survival ranging from 0.5 to 159 months. A statistical analysis employing the Cox-Proportional Hazards model disclosed no significant correlation between AgNOR area and clinical outcome (P > 0.05). The variables, fibrosis, and inflammation, did not demonstrate prognostic significance (P > 0.05). Ploidy demonstrated a statistical trend for prognostic significance (P = 0.077). It is apparent that three of the four parameters studied do not independently affect survival. Although AgNOR has proved useful in the study of other neoplasms such as those of breast, prostate and bladder, it is not of significant importance in predicting the behaviour of chordomas. Ploidy, on the other hand, may be of value in predicting clinical outcome in chordomas and may be a useful marker in the evaluation of the aggressive biological behavior of these neoplasms."

By using search data, the rates of AEC interpretations in the GAA-treated and GAA-untreated samples were calculated. Follow-up data, including human papillomavirus results and follow-up cytology and surgical pathology results, were collected.

CD008054,0,8318408,0,Measurement of cell kinetics in cervical tumours using bromodeoxyuridine.,"The pre-treatment cell kinetics of 120 cervical tumours were assessed following the in vivo labelling with the thymidine analogue Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). In 89% both static and temporal kinetic parameters could be measured. Through the analysis of multiple biopsies from each tumour marked intra tumour heterogeneity was demonstrated. The median values for the most highly labelled sample analysed for each tumour were; S-phase duration (Ts) 12.1 h, BrdUrd labelling index (CLI) 9.5% and potential tumour doubling time 4.4 days. There was a significant elevation in CLI, but no difference in Ts, between tumour and non-neoplastic cervical tissue. There was a significant elevation in CLI, advanced stage and large size tumours. Although a significant elevation in CLI was found in aneuploid tumours this is likely to represent the systemic bias of the calculation methods, with no difference being seen between aneuploid and diploid tumours when BrdUrd labelling was measured with-out reference to the nuclei DNA content. The majority of these patients were treated with radiotherapy and cell kinetic data will be correlated with treatment response when adequate follow up has been achieved."

Eleven mothers had genital genotypes of HPV in their cervical smears, and the children of 8 of these had HPV of the same genotype in buccal mucosal cell samples. Nineteen mothers had no HPV DNA detected in their cervical smears, and 1 of the buccal mucosal cell samples from their children was positive for HPV DNA (p < 0.0001). Contamination of a child's mouth with 'genital' HPV from a mother's cervix appears to occur commonly at birth or in the perinatal period, and to persist for at least 6 weeks. This observation has implications for the epidemiology and management of HPV associated cancer and precancerous conditions in the cervix and the mouth."

The design was qualitative, using focus group discussion to elicit women's attitudes towards HPV testing in the context of cervical cancer prevention. The findings indicate that although some women welcomed the possible introduction of HPV testing, they were not fully aware of the sexually transmitted nature of cervical cancer and expressed anxiety, confusion and stigma about HPV as a sexually transmitted infection. The term 'wart virus', often used by medical professionals to describe high-risk HPV to women, appeared to exacerbate stigma and confusion. Testing positive for HPV raised concerns about women's sexual relationships in terms of trust, fidelity, blame and protection, particularly for women in long-term monogamous relationships. Participation in HPV testing also had the potential to communicate messages of distrust, infidelity and promiscuity to women's partners, family and community. Concern about the current lack of available information about HPV was clearly expressed and public education about HPV was seen as necessary for the whole community, not only women. The management of HPV within cervical screening raises important questions about informed participation. Our findings suggest that HPV testing has the potential to cause psychosocial harm to women and their partners and families."

To the authors' knowledge, there currently are no methods available that can identify accurately ASCUS/human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive women who have an increased risk of developing progressive cervical lesions without the use of invasive procedures. An additional diagnostic tool is needed to triage women properly who are diagnosed with ASCUS.

Many methods for HPV testing are currently available, mostly developed to detect pools of HPV types. Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) is one of the most widely used. A new PCR-based assay, the Roche AMPLICOR HPV test, has been recently developed. Both assays recognize a group of 13 HR HPV types contemporaneously. This study evaluated the performance of both methods for detecting high-grade cervical lesions as a part of management for abnormal PAP smears. The study population was composed of 213 women, all referred to colposcopy and histologic diagnosis following an abnormal PAP test. Biopsy-confirmed high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was used as a gold standard. Overall agreement was 84.9% with a kappa value of 0.6. When comparing the ability to detect moderate cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+) and high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3+/cancer), AMPLICOR proved slightly more sensitive than HC2, a finding that is important when HPV testing is used in a triage of borderline smear results. Genotyping of discordant results showed a prevalence of LR-HPV types in HC2 positive/AMPLICOR negative samples, and a similar prevalence of HR- and LR-HPV types in AMPLICOR positive/HC2 negative samples. In conclusion, the study shows that the AMPLICOR assay is more sensitive than HC2, which makes it a valid alternative for routine clinical use."

CD008054,0,14736603,0,[Colposcopy: the value of HPV testing in clinical practice].,"The indications for colposcopy have changed recently because of the new Bethesda terminology, the introduction of HPV testing in clinical practice, and the latest consensus guidelines on management of patients with an abnormal cervical cytological test. Colposcopy remains the reference technique to assess patients with abnormal cytological test results, especially those with ASC-H, LSIL, HSIL, and AGC. In women with an ASC-US result, colposcopic examination of only those who test positive for high-risk HPV increases the specificity of the technique. When liquid-based cytology is used, HPV DNA testing is the preferred approach in these women. In primary screening using combined cytology and HPV DNA testing in women over the age of 30, colposcopy is indicated in patients with normal cytology and two HR HPV DNA positive tests performed at a nine month interval. For the follow up of untreated patients with ASC-US/LSIL and CIN I, colposcopy carried out at one year after a single HR HPV DNA positive test is as sensitive as colposcopy after two or three abnormal cytology tests. After excision or conization in patients with high-grade CIN, colposcopy after a single HR HPV DNA positive test is as sensitive as cytology testing and colposcopy at six months.

Screening continues to be an effective tool for detecting cervical neoplasia in a pre-invasive state due to the long natural history of progression from low-grade dysplasia to invasion. When abnormal cells are detected with a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, a thorough evaluation should consist of colposcopy, directed biopsy, and cone biopsy, where appropriate. In the absence of invasion, local control may be achieved by excisional or ablative techniques including traditional cold-knife cone, laser cone, loop electrosurgical excision, cryotherapy, laser or electrocoagulation diathermy. The benefit of excisional therapy is the ability for histologic specimen assessment. Ablative therapies are associated with lower complication rates (<2%). Success rates for these modalities are comparable, exceeding 90%.

The complexity of this association lies not only in the fundamental relationship between virus and cancer but also in its translation to pathologic diagnosis and clinical management. Offshoots from the relationship of virus to pathology include studies targeting the link between papillomavirus infection and cervical epithelial abnormalities, the molecular epidemiology of papillomavirus infection, and the potential use of HPV testing as either a screening technique or a tool for managing women who have Pap smear abnormalities. A second variable that is critical to the pathogenesis of cervical neoplasia is the cervical transformation zone. The wide range of invasive and noninvasive lesion phenotypes associated with HPV infection in this region indicate that not only the virus but also specific host target epithelial cells in the transformation zone play an important part in the development of cervical neoplasia. Further understanding of this relationship between the virus and the host epithelium will hinge on determining the subtypes of epithelial cells in the transformation zone and their phenotypic response to infection. New technologies, such as expression arrays, promise to clarify, if not resolve, the complexity of molecular interactions leading to the multiplicity of tumor phenotypes associated with HPV infection of the uterine cervix."

Because this transition is essential for carcinogenesis, detailed research is desirable and may help to triage patients with abnormal Pap smears. Previous studies addressed the chromosomal integration of HPV-16 DNA in biopsies of tumors by an indirect biomarker, methylation of the viral L1 gene and by reverse ligation polymerase chain reaction (rliPCR). The pilot study reported here asked whether these techniques can be targeted successfully at DNA prepared from exfoliated cervical cells. Abnormal Pap smears of 21 patients that were positive for HPV-16 were analyzed for (i and ii) methylation of the L1 gene after bisulfite modification and PCR amplification by direct sequencing and indirectly in cloned DNA and (iii) recombination with chromosomal DNA by rliPCR. Four of these 21 patients contained highly methylated L1 DNA, which was integrated in three of the samples with sufficient DNA for rliPCR analysis. Seven patients contained sporadically methylated L1 DNA, which was integrated in two and episomal in three samples with sufficient DNA. Ten patients contained only unmethylated DNA, which was episomal in six but possibly integrated in two samples. It is concluded that HPV-16 is found integrated chromosomally in a fraction of precancerous infections, and with higher frequency in methylated than in low or unmethylated samples. Since L1 gene methylation indicates integration, it has the potential to be used as a clinical marker of cancer progression."
CD008054,0,9624741,0,Human papillomavirus: disease and laboratory diagnosis.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) can be classified biologically or phylogenetically into cutaneous or mucosal types. Cutaneous papillomaviruses produce benign skin tumours (warts) which occur commonly on the hands, face and feet. They spread readily among children and young adults during recreational activities. Laboratory diagnosis of skin warts is usually unnecessary as they can be distinguished morphologically. Large numbers of cutaneous warts may develop in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, a rare familial disorder. Exposure to sunlight sometimes causes these lesions to progress to skin cancer. HPVs are the most common sexually transmitted viruses, infecting both men and women. They can be transmitted from the vagina at birth, and may cause recurrent respiratory papillomas in childhood or adult life. Genital infection usually clears within a few months, but may persist in some individuals. HPV has been firmly linked with cancer of the cervix, and is also associated with cancer at other mucosal sites. The distribution of genital HPV types varies and is related to the degree of cervical dysplasia present. HPV types 6 and 11 are frequently found in sexually active adults, and are associated with low-grade squamous epithelial lesions. HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 45 are found less frequently, and are associated with progression to invasive cancer. Commercial dot blot hybridisation and DNA-RNA hybridcapture assays are available for laboratory diagnosis of genital HPV infection. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used for diagnosis and epidemiological surveys. Detection of particular HPV types could be useful in the diagnosis and management of cervical cancer in older women, and for resolving equivocal (borderline) cytology. HPV assays, which can distinguish between high-grade and low-grade disease, may also have a role in routine cervical screening."

CD008054,0,12771924,0,Inclusion of HPV testing in routine cervical cancer screening for women above 29 years in Germany: results for 8466 patients.,"In a prospective cohort study 8466 women attending routine cervical cancer screening were recruited. Colposcopy was performed on women with any degree of atypia on cytology and/or a positive high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-DNA test (HC2; Hybrid Capture 2((c))), and for a randomly selected sample of 3.4% women with negative findings on both. Quality control included reviews of cytology, histology, colposcopy images and retesting of samples with polymerase chain reaction. Test diagnostic performances were based on 7908 women who had complete baseline and follow-up results. Routine histology identified 86 women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+), which was confirmed by review histology in only 46 cases. Sensitivity of routine cytology for the detection of CIN2+ was 43.5%, with a specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) of 98.0, 11.4 and 99.7%, respectively. Sensitivity of the HC2 test for the detection of CIN2+ was 97.8%, with a specificity, PPV and NPV, of 95.3, 10.9 and 100%, respectively. No high-grade neoplasia was detected in the randomly selected control group. A negative HPV-test result, even in combination with a positive Papanicolaou (Pap) result, virtually excluded any risk of underlying high-grade disease, but this was not the case for a negative Pap result. These data show that HPV testing is of value for the detection or exclusion of prevalent CIN in a routine cervical cancer-screening setting and could be used for further risk classification of women for follow-up management."

CD008054,0,17022088,0,Juvenile recurrent respiratory papillomatosis: still a mystery disease with difficult management.,"Juvenile recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is the most common benign neoplastic disease of the larynx in children and adolescents and has a significant impact on patients and the health care system with a cost ranging from $60,000 to $470,000 per patient. The aim of this paper is to review the current literature on RRP and summarize the recent advances. RRP is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV; mainly by types 6 and 11). Patients suffer from wart-like growths in the aerodigestive tract. The course of the disease is unpredictable. Although spontaneous remission is possible, pulmonary spread and malignant transformation have been reported. Surgical excision, including new methods like the microdebrider, aims to secure an adequate airway and improve and maintain an acceptable voice. Repeated recurrences are common and thus overenthusiastic attempts to eradicate the disease may cause serious complications. When papillomas recur, old and new adjuvant methods may be tried. In addition, recent advances in immune system research may allow us to improve our treatment modalities and prevention strategies. A new vaccine is under trial to prevent HPV infection in women; the strongest risk factor for juvenile RRP is a maternal history of genital warts (transmitted from mother to child during delivery). Better understanding of the etiology of the disease and the knowledge of all available therapies is crucial for the best management of the affected patients."

We go on to discuss evidence on risk factors associated with increased incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer, including age, sexual behaviour, smoking, socioeconomic status and prolonged use of oral contraceptives. Cervical screening has reduced mortality in some countries, and we outline the necessary features of a successful, effective screening programme before going on to describe why screening failed in Britain, at least until the late 1980s. Current screening policy is designed to remedy this, and we discuss its implications, and those of previous research, for nursing practice."

CD008054,0,13129492,0,New approaches for the management of cervical cancer.,"Since the introduction of the Pap test by George Papanicolaou, the incidence of cervical cancer has fallen and mortality has decreased, in parallel with effective treatment of the precancerous and in situ stages of the disease. However, women who are not diagnosed through screening usually present with advanced disease. Early invasive disease can be treated successfully with radical abdominal hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy or with radiotherapy. A surgical alternative is radical trachelectomy, which can preserve fertility in young women. Advances in the techniques of laparoscopy facilitate procedures, such as radical vaginal hysterectomy with laparoscopic lymphadenectomy, that decrease intra-abdominal scarring and length of hospital stays. The presence of lymph node metastases alters the type of therapy. A range of methods is available to assess lymph nodes, including positron emission tomography, a new approach that may be of value. Radiotherapy alone may not be successful in women with locally advanced disease and adding chemotherapy may eradicate systemic micrometastases that are not affected by radiation. Single-agent cisplatin is the current agent of choice for adding to radiotherapy but new agents are being evaluated. Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with the development of cervical cancer. Vaccines against HPV are being developed and clinically tested and hopefully in the future it may be possible to eradicate cervical cancer."

In this survey of 159 Victorian NI, the NI perceived that knowledge, safety and side effects were among the most important issues raised by parents, schoolgirls, and teachers in the school setting. The most common concern identified by NIs was the physical layout of the vaccination setting (41%), followed by safety, then knowledge of the vaccine.

CD008054,0,18425667,0,"From human papillomavirus (HPV) to cervical cancer: psychosocial processes in infection, detection, and control.","Certain high-risk types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs), which are sexually transmitted persistent, and currently epidemic in the United States, are important etiologic agents in cervical cancer, constituting an acute health threat to women. Consequently, adherence to recommended Papanicolaou (Pap) screening and colposcopy regimens is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment which enhance survival dramatically. This article reviews research and theory on major psychosocial factors relevant to the transmission, onset, and course of this infection. The review focuses on cognitive-affective variables and processes (e.g. monitoring-blunting, anxiety, depression) that underlie--and potentially undermine--adherence to relevant health-protective behaviors. Identification of these processes should facilitate interventions to help women, particularly from low-income, inner city populations who are at highest risk, to adhere to essential follow-up regimens."
CD008054,0,20719230,0,Promising strategies for cervical cancer screening in the post-human papillomavirus vaccination era.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is expected to reduce the burden of cervical cancer in most settings; however, it is also expected to interfere with the effectiveness of screening. In the future, maintaining Pap cytology as the primary cervical screening test may become too costly. As the prevalence of cervical dysplasias decreases, the positive predictive value of the Pap test will also decrease, and, as a result, more women will be referred for unnecessary diagnostic procedures and follow-up. HPV DNA testing has recently emerged as the most likely candidate to replace cytology for primary screening. It is less prone to human error and much more sensitive than the Pap smear in detecting high-grade cervical lesions. Incorporating this test would improve the overall quality of screening programs and allow spacing out screening tests, while maintaining safety and lowering costs. Although HPV testing is less specific than Pap cytology, this issue could be resolved by reserving the latter for the more labour-efficient task of triaging HPV-positive cases. Because most HPV-positive smears would contain relevant abnormalities, Pap cytology would be expected to perform with sufficient accuracy under these circumstances. HPV Pap triage would also provide a low-cost strategy to monitor long-term vaccine efficacy. Although demonstration projects could start implementing HPV testing as a population screening tool, more research is needed to determine the optimal age to initiate screening, the role of HPV typing and other markers of disease progression, and appropriate follow-up algorithms for HPV-positive and Pap-negative women."

The use of cold-knife or carbon dioxide laser excisions was recommend as the procedure of choice--particularly for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia lesions. With the introduction of the loop electrosurgical excision procedure, the focus rapidly shifted to electrosurgical excision, which has been found to be clinically useful, although with caveats, and is now the procedure of choice."

CD008054,0,14870779,0,Recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) in the follow-up and treatment of patients with thyroid cancer.,"The follow-up of thyroid cancer is based on the detection of residual and recurrent thyroid carcinoma. This is traditionally done by means of measurements of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) combined with various imaging techniques (131I-whole body scan, ultrasound and other modalities). Tg serum levels and the uptake of 131I on a whole body scan (WBS) depend on TSH stimulation, which in thyroidectomized patients can be obtained either by withdrawal of thyroid hormone treatment (thyroxine) or by administration of exogenous TSH. At present exogenous human TSH is obtained by means of recombinant DNA technology, (recombinant human TSH (rhTSH), Thyrogen). Even if the administration of rhTSH and withdrawal of thyroid hormone are not completely equivalent, the use of rhTSH has already entered the clinical routine (rhTSH Tg test and rhTSH WBS) because with rhTSH the morbidity and discomfort associated with the withdrawal of thyroid hormone can be avoided. At a recent International Consensus Conference on the follow-up of differentiated thyroid carcinoma it was proposed to carry out only Tg measurement after rhTSH stimulation; moreover, it was stated that 131I whole body scan has to be discouraged in patients submitted to radical surgery and radioiodine ablation with no clinical evidence of residual tumor and with undetectable levels of Tg during hormonal suppression of TSH. Similar strategies in this respect tend to eliminate the 131I WBS and propose only the rhTSH Tg test combined with head and neck ultrasound (US). This is still a matter of debate, also because it is not valid for all risk groups and not all patients undergo the same clinical management (radical surgery or not, thyroid ablation with 131I or not). However, the availability of rhTSH will definitely change the management of papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma, also with regard to iodine treatment. In fact, rhTSH can be used during radioiodine treatment to enhance the 131I uptake by the cancer cells in particular groups of patients. Patients who could benefit from this approach can be divided into three subgroups: 1) patients in whom thyroxine withdrawal may be dangerous because of the effects of long-term TSH stimulation on the tumor mass (brain metastases, vertebral metastases, presence of neurological signs, heart diseases); 2) patients affected by tumors with marked biological aggressiveness and a low iodine uptake (variants of follicular carcinoma, insular carcinoma, tall and columnar cell variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma, HÃ¼rthle cell carcinoma); 3) patients with hypothalamic-pituitary alterations. The potential efficiency of rhTSH in radiometabolic treatment is an important issue that has been studied in a limited number of patients, but is worthy of further investigations in large perspective. A recent clinical prospective trial has been proposed by the Thyroid Cancer Study Group of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori and is now ongoing."

CD008054,0,9744721,0,The natural history of CIN I lesions.,"The published literature indicates 11% of CIN I lesions on average progress to a higher grade dysplasia and the remainder either regress or persist. Reliable markers of disease outcome are yet to be identified. A longitudinal study of 342 women referred for colposcopic examination of a CIN I detected by a screening Pap test, and classified by the colposcopic impression and Pap test at that exam as </= CIN 1 was designed to identify predictors of disease outcome. The cohort was comprised of 220 women who satisfactorily completed the study and whose disease was neither biopsied or treated at the initial examination. All had HPV DNA testing by PCR, and were followed with interval colposcopic examinations and repeat Pap tests for a limited time period. The initial HPV DNA status and a number of measured clinico-pathological and risk factor variables were analyzed to identify outcome predictors. All underwent a biopsy either at the conclusion of the study or because their disease was considered to have progressed during the follow up period. Biopsy confirmed progression to CIN II/III occurred in 41 (18.6%), persistence of CIN I/Condyloma in 41 (18.6%), and regression to <CIN I/Condyloma in 138 (62.7%). HPV DNA positivity and current, oral contraceptive use were the only independent predictors of progression when age at diagnosis, the number of follow up visits, and time to progression were controlled. Predictors of persistent and regressed disease were not identified. The study highlights a clinical role for HPV testing in the colposcopic management of CIN I lesions. Oral contraceptives may promote progression by regulating the oncogenic sequences of the HPV."

Median follow-up time was 57 (32-80) months. A total of 230 patients died of cervical cancer during follow-up. Ploidy level had no prognostic significance, neither when analyzed as diploid against nondiploid nor when utilizing different cutoff levels for DNA index (1.3, 1.5, and 1.7). The fraction of S-phase cells (SPF) could be evaluated in 91% of the diploid cases but in only 22% of nondiploid cases. SPF had no prognostic impact. In multivariate analysis, FIGO stage was the only independent prognostic factor (P < 0.001). There was no difference between squamous cell, adeno, and adenosquamous carcinomas. A radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 123 cases in stage I-IIA. In this subgroup, tumor size (P = 0.001), infiltration into the parametria (P = 0.005), vessel invasion (P = 0.008), and metastasis to the common iliac nodes (P = 0.013) obtained independent statistical significance in multivariate analysis, while ploidy level had no significance.

The endometrial carcinoma with its different histological subtypes counts for most of the malignomas of the uterine body. But the rare category of uterine sarcomas (carcinosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas as well as endometrial stromal sarcomas) also belongs to this group. Cervical cancer presents an own entitity, regarding both histology and therapeutic options. Endometrial cancer is the most common genital malignoma in Northern Europe and North America. Histologically, the endometrial cancer can be subdivided in two groups: type I is hormonal sensitive and well differentiated, type II represents an undifferenciated aggressive tumour with poor prognosis. In general, the patient is elderly. Due to the main symptom - abnormal vaginal bleeding - endometrial cancer is detected in an early stage in about 75% of all patients. First choice in therapy is stage related surgery. Follow-up schemes have not proved yet to improve survival, therefore clear guidelines are missing. National and international groups recommend regular follow-up visits to detect the early vaginal vault relapse which is curable. Cervical cancer is mainly a squamous cell carcinoma and oncogenic Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) associated. Surgery is only indicated up to stage IIA, advanced stages should be treated by radio-chemotherapy. Several studies have shown that follow-up visits can improve survival rates. Intention is the detection of the curable local relapse."

CD008054,0,17091881,0,[Screening for cervical cancer].,"Cervical cancer incidence and mortality are falling off since the introduction of pap smear in the early 60's. In Belgium, however, there is no controlled screening politics. Oncogenic papillomaviruses are implicated in cervical cancer. Their identification is possible on thin layer technique, which allows the clinician to adapt his follow-up whether they are present or not, notably in case of borderline or low grade lesions. Cervical cancer is progressing slowly, the peak incidence happening more or less ten years after first lesions. Therefore, screening starting age, frequency and ending age are still debated. In Belgium, it is still not organised and may miss the most exposed populations. Furthermore, screening frequency is decreasing rapidly after age of 50 even though there is another incidence peak of cervical cancer at the age of 70. Pap smears' evolution in Belgium is unsure since there will be soon HPV vaccines available. But these will not be active against all oncogenic types and though they will be given to young girls before their first sexual experiences, the rest of the female population will require pap smear for a few years."

Both samples-101 women with human papillomavirus-related precancerous cervical dysplasia and 75 HIV-infected gay men-were undergoing long-term medical follow-up and management. Structural equation analysis showed an adequate fit of the MPM to the data within each sample, supporting the model's heuristic value: High monitors experienced greater disease-related intrusive ideation, which triggered greater avoidant ideation to forestall panic, particularly in the more threatened HIV-positive sample. However, efforts to avoid disturbing intrusive thoughts were ineffective, requiring increasingly extreme defensive strategies (i.e., denial and mental and behavioral disengagement)."

CD008054,0,10405798,0,Pap smear follow-up of possible role of mucopurulent exudate as a prognosticator of a negative pregnancy outcome.,"Our objective was to study a cohort of women by various means to detect sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and to correlate the presence of mucopurulent exudate (PEX) on Papanicolaou (Pap) smears with pregnancy outcome. Bacteriologic cultures taken from swabs for chlamydia and gonorrhea were correlated with Gen-Probe results. Smears were examined for trichomonas, yeast, HPV, obscuring mucopurulent exudate, and squamous intraepithelial abnormalities. There was no positive correlation between STD and negative pregnancy outcome. Mucopurulent exudate on Pap smears was very high in this population. Continuing study of this population of women is needed to see if larger cohorts will demonstrate any positive correlations between PEX and pregnancy outcome. Placing women with obscuring mucopurulent exudate in a ""high-risk"" category for complications may prevent adverse side effects to the birth product.

KS may also involve mucosal sites, lymph nodes and visceral organs. During the last two decades, with the large increase in the incidence of this tumor associated with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), there have been increasing number of cases with KS presenting on the skin or mucosa of the head and neck. A review of the literature revealed that only six cases of primary KS of the nasal cavity have previously been published and only one of them presented in a patient not associated with AIDS. We report the case of a 59-year-old woman who presented 4 years ago with nasal obstruction and intermittent minor epistaxes. Physical examination revealed the presence of a fleshy tumor arising from the left nasal septum, which was excised. Histological examination of the tumor showed morphological and immunohistochemical features of KS. A complete physical and laboratory examination revealed no other pathological findings. The patient received no further treatment and 4 years later, she is in excellent condition. In the present study, we report the second case where the primary manifestation of the KS was in the nasal cavity in a patient with an adequate immune system."

Sufficient scientific evidence exists to recommend HPV DNA testing in the triage of women with equivocal cytology and in follow-up after the treatment of precursor lesions. However, due to a low clinical specificity and positive predictive value, HPV DNA testing has so far not been recommended as primary screening in Europe. In general, diagnostic HPV tests have to demonstrate accuracy, reproducibility and clinical utility before they can be used in patient management and implemented in cervical cancer screening programmes. In this article we give an overview of RNA-based HPV diagnostics and the role of E6/E7 mRNA detection as a predictive marker for the development of cervical carcinoma. HPV E6/E7 mRNA testing for high-risk types seems to correlate better with the severity of the lesion compared with HPV DNA testing, and is a potential marker for the identification of women at risk of developing cervical carcinoma. Commercial assays for simultaneous genotyping and detection of E6/E7 mRNA from the five most common high-risk HPV types are now available and require further evaluation for primary screening, triage and follow-up after treatment."
CD008054,0,20182342,0,An immunohistochemical study of cervical neuroendocrine carcinomas: Neoplasms that are commonly TTF1 positive and which may express CK20 and P63.,"Cervical small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) are uncommon but highly aggressive neoplasms. From a diagnostic point of view, there may be problems both in distinguishing these from other neoplasms and in confirming a cervical origin. This is important as management is critically dependent on the correct histologic diagnosis. We undertook a detailed immunohistochemical analysis of a relatively large series of primary cervical SCNEC (n=13) and LCNEC (n=8). Cases were stained with AE1/3, chromogranin, CD56, synaptophysin, PGP9.5, TTF1, p16, p63, CK7, CK20, neurofilament, and CD99. CK20 and neurofilament staining was undertaken to investigate whether some of these neoplasms might exhibit a Merkel cell immunophenotype and CD99 staining to assess whether there is immunohistochemical overlap with neoplasms in the Ewing family of tumors (EFT). For all markers, staining was classified as negative, 1+ (<10% cells immunoreactive), 2+ (10 to 50% cells immunoreactive), or 3+ (>50% cells immunoreactive). Eleven and 6 SCNEC and LCNEC, respectively were positive with AE1/3. Chromogranin, CD56, synaptophysin, and PGP9.5 were positive in 11, 19, 19, and 9 cases, respectively. Altogether 15 cases (71%) (11 SCNEC, 4 LCNEC) exhibited nuclear positivity, often diffuse, with TTF1. All but 1 case was diffusely positive with p16. p63 was positive in 9 cases, including 5 with diffuse nuclear immunoreactivity. Ten and 4 neoplasms were positive with CK7 and CK20, respectively. Neurofilament was positive in 7 tumors. The 4 neoplasms that were CK20 positive were stained with the monoclonal antibody CM2B4, generated against an antigenic epitope on the Merkel cell polyomavirus T antigen; all were negative. CD99 was positive in 6 cases. In 2 cases, adjacent foci of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) contained scattered individual chromogranin positive cells, raising the possibility that some cervical neuroendocrine carcinomas arise from neuroendocrine cells in AIS. Four of 13 cases of pure AIS also contained scattered chromogranin positive cells. Our results illustrate that a proportion of cervical neuroendocrine carcinomas are negative with broad spectrum cytokeratins and some of the commonly used neuroendocrine markers. TTF1 positivity is extremely common and may be a useful marker of a neuroendocrine carcinoma. It is of no value in exclusion of a pulmonary primary. p16 is almost always positive in cervical neuroendocrine carcinomas, possibly owing to an association with oncogenic human papillomavirus, although other mechanisms of expression are also possible. Cervical neuroendocrine carcinomas may be p63 positive, illustrating that this marker is not specific for squamous differentiation. CK20 and neurofilament positivity in some cervical neuroendocrine carcinomas is in keeping with a Merkel cell immunophenotype, similar to that described in SCNECs in other organs. However, the absence of staining with CM2B4 argues against a true Merkel cell tumor. CD99 staining in a cervical neuroendocrine carcinoma should not result in misdiagnosis as a neoplasm in the Ewing family of tumors."

CD008054,0,11449407,0,Prospective clinical study comparing DNA flow cytometry and HPV typing as predictive tests for persistence and progression of CIN I/II.,"A cohort of 70 consecutive women at a university hospital colposcopy clinic with untreated CIN I and CIN II (CIN I/II) confirmed by cytology and histology was followed for 1 year in the setting of a prospective trial. In the lesions, the presence of DNA from HPV types was examined by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Aneuploid cell lines were demonstrated by aneuploid histograms generated by high-resolution DNA flow cytometry. HPV type 16 infection and the existence of aneuploid cell lines proved to be significant risk factors for CIN I/II lesions to persist or progress to CIN III in the 1-year follow-up period in the same cohort of patients. The relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 1.81 (1.44-2.76) for aneuploid cell lines and 1.74 (1.10-2.76) for HPV type 16 infection in CIN I/II lesions. As a predictive diagnostic test for CIN I/II lesions to persist or progress, the specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) for aneuploid histograms were 100% (CI, 73.5-100%) and 100% (CI, 86.8-100%), respectively. The low sensitivity of 27.3% (CI, 14.9-42.8%) restricted the clinical application of the test, leaving 32 of 44 women with persisting or progressing CINI/II with diploid histograms. HPV type 16 positivity by FRLP had a PPV of 68.4% (CI, 43.5-87.4%) as a prognostic test. Six of 19 HPV 16 infected women showed complete remission of their CIN lesion. A combination of the two tests did not provide any additional information."
CD008054,0,7675768,0,"Extramedullary plasmacytoma of the head and neck: use of paraffin sections to assess clonality with in situ hybridization, growth fraction, and the presence of Epstein-Barr virus.","The diagnosis of extramedullary plasmacytomas (EMP) is usually easy to conform with immunohistochemical stains for kappa and lambda. In some cases, however, immunostains are problematic. In addition, prognostic features are not well described nor is it known whether EMP are associated with the Epstein-Barr virus. Therefore, 23 EMP of the head and neck (from 20 patients) were studied to (1) compare a non-isotopic paraffin section in situ hybridization technique for kappa and lambda mRNA with standard immunohistochemical techniques for assessing light chain expression, (2) compare the histologic grade to the proliferative fraction using an antibody for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and (3) determine the frequency of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) association using probes for the EBV DNA (EBV NOT 1) and RNA (EBER-1). Light chain class restriction was demonstrated in 22/23 biopsies by in situ hybridization and in 21/23 biopsies by standard immunohistochemical techniques. Five of the six biopsies of well-differentiated EMP had proliferating cell nuclear antigen scores of 0 to 10% positive cells and one had 11 to 25% positive cells compared with greater than 75% in the one poorly differentiated EMP. Of 15 moderately differentiated EMP, 10 had proliferating cell nuclear antigen scores of 11 to 75%, and 5 had scores of greater than 75%. EBV DNA was detected in 1/23 biopsies and EBV RNA in 4/23 biopsies (3 patients). Thus, non-isotopic in situ hybridization is a useful technique to document clonality of plasma cells in routinely fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. Unlike routine immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization avoids the problem of detecting stromal or nonspecific uptake of immunoglobulin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008054,0,8790530,0,UK cervical cancer screening programme: setting a research agenda.,"The UK national cervical cancer screening programme aims at reducing the incidence of and mortality from carcinoma of the cervix. It is generally agreed that high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia should be treated aggressively, but the appropriate management strategies for women with lesser degrees of abnormality are uncertain because of the inability to distinguish lesions that are likely to progress to invasive disease from those that will regress spontaneously. The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) and the possible usefulness of HPV testing as a secondary screening tool in women with borderline or mild dyskaryosis is also unknown. This paper proposes an agenda for research into the uncertainties within the UK screening programme, suggesting that priority should be given to determining the most appropriate referral and management policies and the use of HPV DNA assay for women with borderline and mild dyskaryosis, so that those women at highest risk of developing invasive disease are treated. A randomised controlled trial is needed. The practical and methodological difficulties which would need to be considered and the need to convene a multidisciplinary research team to develop and implement the trial are highlighted."

CD008054,0,17652195,0,Photodynamic therapy in dentistry.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT), also known as photoradiation therapy, phototherapy, or photochemotherapy, involves the use of a photoactive dye (photosensitizer) that is activated by exposure to light of a specific wavelength in the presence of oxygen. The transfer of energy from the activated photosensitizer to available oxygen results in the formation of toxic oxygen species, such as singlet oxygen and free radicals. These very reactive chemical species can damage proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and other cellular components. Applications of PDT in dentistry are growing rapidly: the treatment of oral cancer, bacterial and fungal infection therapies, and the photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) of the malignant transformation of oral lesions. PDT has shown potential in the treatment of oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and head and neck cancer. Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) has been efficacious in the treatment of bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viral infections. The absence of genotoxic and mutagenic effects of PDT is an important factor for long-term safety during treatment. PDT also represents a novel therapeutic approach in the management of oral biofilms. Disruption of plaque structure has important consequences for homeostasis within the biofilm. Studies are now leading toward selective photosensitizers, since killing the entire flora leaves patients open to opportunistic infections. Dentists deal with oral infections on a regular basis. The oral cavity is especially suitable for PACT, because it is relatively accessible to illumination."

CD008054,0,16410891,0,"Human papillomavirus infection in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: a retrospective study.","There is considerable data to support a central role for human papillomavirus (HPV) in the etiology of cervical cancer. More than a 100 HPV types have been described, and 40 have been isolated from benign and malignant genital lesions. Consequently, there is strong motivation to evaluate HPV testing for cervical cancer screening. Few studies concerning the natural history of HPV infection have been conducted in the state of Rio de Janeiro. We determined the prevalence of HPV types in female genital lesions by using Hybrid Capture Assay (HCA) and we retrospectively analyzed the course of HPV infection. Our sample included 788 women attended at LaboratÃ³rios SÃ©rgio Franco. The average age of the participants was 29.6 years. HPV prevalence and cytological diagnosis were determined. The overall prevalence of HPV DNA in the study group was 50.1% (395/788), ranging from 25% (NORMAL) to 100% in high-grade intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). High risk HPV was found in 12% inflammatory, 58.3% HPV, 63.2% LSIL and 100% HSIL. A retrospective analysis of 78 patients showed that 22 presented persistent lesions, 2 had progressive lesions, 4 had regressive lesions, 13 showed latent infections, 18 were transiently infected and 19 were submitted to curative treatment. No cases of cancer were registered in this population, which can afford private medical care and regular follow-up exams. We suggest that HCA be used in specific cases involving persistent and recurrent lesions."

CD008054,0,17291250,0,Increased expression level of squamous cell carcinoma antigen 2 and 1 ratio is associated with poor prognosis in early-stage uterine cervical cancer.,"Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) is a tumor marker for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix, lung, and esophagus. It was encoded by two highly homologous genes, SCCA1 and SCCA2. However, the relevance of SCCA genes to squamous cell carcinogenesis and patient outcome remains far from clear. In this study, by using laser microdissection and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction procedures, the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the SCCA1 and SCCA2 genes in normal, dysplastic, and malignant squamous epithelia from uterine cervical tissues were analyzed and correlated with outcome of cancer patients. We found that the SCCA2/A1 mRNA ratios were progressively increased from normal, dysplastic, to cancer cells, and the mean ratio was significantly higher in cancer tissues than that in normal epithelium (P= 0.02). The SCCA2/A1 mRNA ratios were not significantly associated with types of human papillomavirus infection (P > 0.05). High SCCA2/SCCA1 mRNA ratios (ratio >1) were an independent predictor of disease recurrence (relative risk: 3.58; P= 0.003). Of the 38 patients with cervical cancer, 12 patients with high SCCA2/SCCA1 mRNA ratios had a significant lower 2-year disease-free survival of only 50%, while it was 92% in those with low SCCA2/SCCA1 mRNA ratios (P < 0.001). In conclusion, our study indicated that the ratios of SCCA2 to SCCA1 RNA were increased during the process of cervical carcinogenesis, and patients with elevated SCCA2/A1 ratio carried a higher risk for recurrence in early-stage uterine cervical cancer."

In 24 vaginal and 15 vulvar scrapes, the same type of HPV as in cervical scrapes was detected. The frequencies of HPV DNA in vaginal and vulvar scrapes for histological diagnosis of cervical neoplasia were 84.6% (11/13) and 53.8% (7/13) in mild dysplasias, both were 100% (5/5) in moderate dysplasias, 75% (3/4) and 25% (1/4) in severe dysplasias, 66.7% (2/3) and 33.3% (1/3) in CISs, and 60% (3/5) and 20% (1/5) in invasive carcinomas, respectively. The results of vulvar scrapes showed that the frequency of HPV DNA in mild and moderate dysplasias was significantly higher than that in severe dysplasias, CISs and invasive carcinomas (p < 0.05). We suggest that, in addition to the investigation for the natural history of HPV infection, cell dynamics, local immunological status and any other factors in the HPV-infected lesion must be investigated to clarify the carcinogenesis of HPV in the uterine cervix. Furthermore, HPVs detected in the vagina and vulva were thought to have disappeared without reaching an integrated form during the follow-up of cervical neoplasia with HPV infection over a long period."
CD008054,0,18191500,0,[Management of CIN1].,"A cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1) is a lesion of basal cells consisting in an architecture disorganization and cytological atypia limited to the lower third of the cervical epithelium. It is considered as a precancerous lesion uterine cervix carcinoma while they spontaneously regress in more than 60% of cases in two years. The problems related to the management of CIN1 as defined by the recommendations established in 2002 are the over-treatment and the great variability of clinical practices. Moreover, the potential of new tests has been investigated since 2002. To establish these new recommendations, the medline database has been consulted and the references essentially published between 2001 and May 2007 have been investigated. Publications were selected and classified according to their level of evidence (LE) in order to establish the grade of recommendations. One of the problems encountered when facing a CIN1 is to misdiagnose a more severe lesion firstly because of the intra- and interobserver variability and secondly because the colposcopy-directed biopsy is not mandatorily representative of the more severe lesion. Nevertheless, because the risk of cancer is extremely low, a conization is not necessary in an asymptomatic woman with a LSIL/ASC-US pap smear in case of CIN1 even if the squamocolumnar junction is not entirely visualized (LE 2/3). The endocervical curettage cannot be recommended in this case because its efficacy is globally poor and unknown in case of CIN1. Concerning the natural history of CIN1, the recent studies, which included more than 1200 women and more than 700 for two of them, confirm that the rate of progression of a CIN1 to a CIN3 or more severe lesion is less than 9% in the two years following the initial diagnosis (LE2). A CIN1 is associated with a risk of evolution to a CIN2 or more severe lesion that is not markedly more important than the risk associated with a LSIL/ASC-US pap smear while the colposcopy is normal or the biopsy is negative (between 8 and 13% whatever the results of the initial colposcopy) (LE 2/3). The recommendation in case of CIN1 is a strict follow-up. A colposcopy and a treatment are necessary in case of persistence or progression of the abnormalities (LE2). Data from trials studying the contribution of HPV testing in case of CIN1 show that its sensitivity is similar to repeat cytology with less referral to colposcopy to detect CIN2 or more severe lesion. These data have been considered to establish follow-up recommendations to manage CIN1: if the exams (cytology and/or HPV testing) at 12 months are negative, patients can be followed by an annual cytology. In case of aggravation of the cytology, a colposcopy is necessary. In case of positive HPV testing or persisting ASC-US/LSIL at 12 months, a repeat control is necessary at 18 months and a treatment is proposed according to colposcopy findings."

CD008054,0,15617297,0,Management of genital warts.,"Genital warts caused by human papillomavirus infection are encountered commonly in primary care. Evidence guiding treatment selection is limited, but treatment guidelines recently have changed. Biopsy, viral typing, acetowhite staining, and other diagnostic measures are not routinely required. The goal of treatment is clearance of visible warts; some evidence exists that treatment reduces infectivity, but there is no evidence that treatment reduces the incidence of cervical and genital cancer. The choice of therapy is based on the number, size, site, and morphology of lesions, as well as patient preferences, cost, convenience, adverse effects, and clinician experience. Patient-applied therapy such as imiquimod cream or podofilox is increasingly recommended. Podofilox, imiquimod, surgical excision, and cryotherapy are the most convenient and effective options. Fluorouracil and interferon are no longer recommended for routine use. The cost per successful treatment course is approximately dollars 200 to dollars 300 for podofilox, cryotherapy, electrodesiccation, surgical excision, laser treatment, and the loop electrosurgical excision procedure."

We enrolled 32 women with incident cervical dysplasia, including cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, CIN II, and CIN III/carcinoma in situ, and 113 control women with normal cervical cytology in case-control study. Micronutrient levels were estimated from a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and measured from blood samples. Information on risk factors for cervical neoplasia was elicited by interview. Hybrid capture was used to determine infection with human papillomavirus. After adjustment for potential confounders, analysis of micronutrient levels estimated from the FFQ suggested that women in the upper tertile of lycopene and vitamin A intake were one-third (odds ratio = 0.32, 95% confidence interval = 0.8-1.3) and one-fourth (odds ratio = 0.24, 95% confidence interval = 0.05-1.2) as likely, respectively, to have dysplasia as women in the lower tertile. Borderline protective trends (p < or = 0.10) were apparent. Elevated levels of serum lycopene also suggested some protection against dysplasia. Results were not significant at alpha = 0.05 because of the small number of case women enrolled. Overall, correlations between estimates from the FFQ and serum levels were poor. This study indicates that, among black women, lycopene and perhaps vitamin A may play a protective role in the early stages of cervical carcinogenesis."

We now report a case of MTC in which a RET somatic mutation at codon 918 was detected in fine-needle aspiration specimens obtained from both the thyroid nodule and two enlarged neck lymph nodes but not in peripheral blood. Therefore, a diagnosis of sporadic MTC was made before surgery. Thus, this approach, by excluding preoperatively multiple endocrine neoplasia disease, permitted immediate thyroidectomy without search for pheochromocytoma.

The purpose of the study was to analyse cytology-histology correlation after conisation or Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone (LLETZ), resection margin status, compliance to the follow-up protocol and evaluation of cervical cytology and HPV testing in two year period after surgical treatment. We retrospectively reviewed 251 cases of conisation or LLETZ performed between January and December, 2006. Conventional cervical smears were analysed and abnormal cytology was defined as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse (ASCUS+). The digene Hybrid capture 2 test was used for detection of high-risk HPV types. Histology analysis demonstrated CIN1 + lesion in 234 cases (93.2%) with cytology-histology correlation in 97.9% of cases. A preoperative HPV test was made in 142 histologically confirmed CIN1 + lesions and 137 (96.5%) tested positive. The resection margins were involved in 48 (20.8%) cases. In 24 (10.3%) cases the margins were difficult to determine. Abnormal cytology was found in 33 (15.2%) cases of the 217 (86.5%) patients that attended the post-treatment visits. The post-treatment HPV test was performed on 159 women and it was positive in 25 (15.7%) cases. The complete follow-up control cytology, with at least three Pap smears in the subsequent two years or with second treatment, was registered in only 146 (58.2%) patients. 14/217 (6.5%) patients underwent second treatment with histologically confirmed treatment failure. In all patients with control smear, repeated cytology found HSIL. On six women, the control HPV test was performed. In five cases, it was positive and in one case with histological diagnoses of VAIN2, it was negative. Our study confirms the important role of cervical cytology in the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial lesions and monitoring after treatment. In the future we will have to improve compliance to the follow-up protocols and use of the HPV test in the selection of women at risk of treatment failure."
CD008054,0,12355370,0,Human papillomavirus DNA remains detectable longer than related cervical cytologic abnormalities.,"Cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are at high risk of neoplastic progression if they persist. Persistence can be measured by repeated HPV DNA tests or by cytologic testing. Thus, it is useful to understand the relationship between these 2 measurements. To explore the relative timing of HPV DNA clearance versus cytologic regression, data were analyzed from 840 study participants who were followed-up by repeat thin-layer cytology and HPV testing by a hybrid capture test at 6-month intervals for 2 years. On average, HPV DNA detection persisted longer than related cytologic abnormalities (P<.001). HPV type-specific data from a subset of 448 women with complete polymerase chain reaction test data confirmed that HPV DNA persisted longer than cytologic abnormalities (P<.001). It appears that the natural history of HPV typically includes periods before and after cytologic abnormality, in which HPV DNA is the more sensitive indicator of infection."
CD008054,0,1635730,0,High rates of atypical cervical cytology: occurrence and clinical significance.,"The current literature suggests that atypical (benign atypia or class II) Papanicolaou smears occur at a frequency of 1.6-5.4% and are associated with a substantial rate of underlying cervical dysplasia. However, we noted that our rate of atypia exceeded these figures, particularly in our clinic population. To quantify this observation, 1107 consecutive Papanicolaou smears from the clinic population were audited prospectively and compared with 262 consecutive Papanicolaou smears performed contemporaneously in private patients served by the same laboratory. The rate of histologic dysplasia underlying this diagnosis was assessed by analyzing the results of 101 consecutive colposcopic examinations performed subsequently on clinic patients evaluated for persistently atypical cytology (atypical index smear followed by repeat cytology scheduled 2-4 months later). The prevalence of atypia in the clinic population was 321 of 1107 (29%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 26-32%), a rate 2.3 times that of the private patients (33 of 262, 13%) (P less than .001). Eighteen of 101 clinic patients with persistent atypia had dysplasia (18%; 95% CI 11-25%), and 25 of 101 (25%; 95% CI 17-33%) had human papillomavirus infection, both documented by the histology of directed cervical biopsies. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II or higher was present in three of these 18 women (17%; 95% CI 6-39%). We conclude that some populations have atypical cervical cytology at a frequency much greater than that reported previously. Furthermore, the pathology underlying this diagnosis is considerable and warrants evaluation. The optimal management of atypical cervical cytology in such populations is problematic."

CD008054,0,9609926,0,[Epidemiology and diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia--is the present concept of screening and diagnosis still current?].,"Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the major factor in the genesis of cervical intraepithelial (CIN) and invasive neoplasia. However, screening is still based upon cytology and further diagnostic investigation relies on colposcopy with punch biopsy. In this review, recent studies are evaluated with regard to consequences for optimal screening and management strategies of CIN. In summary, exfoliative cytology is still widely considered as the method of choice for population screening. Primary HPV DNA screening proves equivalent or superior to cytology only in populations with a low prevalence of HPV infections. Preliminary data from serological HPV tests are less promising. Cytological diagnosis of HPV infection may be verified by HPV testing. Recognizing high oncogenic risk viruses in CIN 1 may help to reduce the control period from 24 to 12 months and may lead to immediate therapy for CIN 2 lesions. However, further prospective studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of HPV DNA tests in German-speaking countries are necessary."

On recruitment, patients responded most frequently and with the highest numbers of responding cells to the L1 region aa 311-345 and this response was significantly associated with the presence of cervical disease (P=0.041). Responses to the L1 peptide aa 281-295 were significantly higher in patients with CIN III than in those with HPV/CIN I or CIN II lesions (P=0.027). The E7 region aa 70-98 was the most immunogenic in patients with squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix (SIL) but the responses detected were not significantly higher than in patients without SIL. Following treatment, the T cell response profiles of patient groups did not change significantly. However, on analysis of the responses of individual patients with and without recurrent disease on follow-up, significant differences were found. Recurrence of disease was associated with T cell responses to the E7 region aa 70-98 at the patient's first clinic visit (P=0.017). Recurrence of disease was also accompanied by an increase in the total number of L1-specific short-term T cell lines (STLs) at follow-up, whereas absence of disease was accompanied by a decrease in L1-specific STLs. The data also suggested a possible link between E7 70-98-specific responses and acquisition of disease by patients who were previously disease-free. Further studies are warranted to determine whether this response could be useful as a marker of recurrent disease in some patients."

However, the circumstances to get this improvement are not the same between countries. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of introducing human papilloma virus testing in the current screening practice both in developed and developing countries. We conducted a review of published articles since January 2000 until December 2006 related to the cost effectiveness of introducing human papilloma virus testing in cervical cancer screening programs. A total of 17 original researches and six reviews were analyzed. Human papilloma virus testing is cost effective in developed countries only if it is a complementary test to Pap test and used to determine the management of women with atypical squamus cells of undetermined significance, the interval among tests is increased more than two years and it is performed in women over 30 years. On the other hand, developing countries should establish first organized screening programs and guarantee full coverage and access to diagnosis and treatment."

CD008054,0,15489651,0,Eosinophilic dysplasia of the cervix: a newly recognized variant of cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia.,"A proportion of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions encountered in surgical pathology practice contain both metaplastic features and some degree of atypia [so-called eosinophilic dysplasia (ED)] that defy classification according to established criteria. To elucidate the nature of these lesions, we compared 44 cases of ED to 20 classic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) and 10 squamous metaplasias using a panel of biomarkers and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. EDs were defined as 1) lack of normal maturation; 2) relatively abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and distinct cell borders compared with conventional HSIL; 3) mildly to moderately increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio; and 4) focal dysplastic nuclei showing nuclear enlargement, hyperchromasia, variable nuclear membrane irregularities, and appreciable nucleoli. Expression of p16 (p16), MIB-1 (Ki-67) labeling index, and HPV DNA detection and typing were performed on each case. The majority of EDs showed more than three atypical cells in an entire lesion but lack of apparent features of HSIL. It was common to find neighboring cervical squamous metaplasia and/or conventional SILs (either HSIL or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL]). Among the 44 cases, 18 (45%) ED lesions were found to be associated with HSIL, 15 (34%) with LSIL or condylomatous lesions, and 13 (30%) EDs were seen without any SILs in the entire specimens. Area of benign squamous metaplasia was found in all ED cases. High levels of p16 and MIB-1 expression were seen in 41 (93%) of 44 ED cases with degrees of immunoreactivity closely resembling those seen with HSIL. Of 16 EDs tested, 13 (81%) were positive for HPV DNAs. Among 10 HPV-positive cases subtyped, 9 (90%) cases contained intermediate- and/or high-risk HPVs and 1 case contained a novel HPV. In the follow-up of pure ED cases, the majority showed presence of dysplastic lesions of either HSIL or LSIL on either loop electric excision procedures or Papanicolaou test samples after a 6- to 10-week period. Therefore, ED represents an unrecognized and potentially clinically significant subgroup of cervical intraepithelial lesions. Based on the unique histologic appearance of ED, its association in some cases with HSIL, the overall immunohistochemical findings, frequent association of ED with intermediate- and/or high-risk HPV infection, and limited follow-up data, we believe that ED represents a variant of HSIL (CIN 2). Since ED possesses histologic features of both dysplasia and metaplasia, we speculate that it may arise from metaplastic cervical squamous epithelium that has subsequently become infected with intermediate- or high-risk HPV."
CD008054,0,18410393,0,Anal intraepithelial neoplasia in HIV infection.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections belong to the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide. While the immune system eliminates most HPV infections over time in immunocompetent individuals, HPV infections tend to persist in immunodeficient individuals. In HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM), anal HPV prevalence is more than 90% and infections with multiple HPV types are common. Consequently, HPV-associated anogenital malignancies occur with high frequency in patients with HIV infection. Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) is a potential precursor lesion of squamous cell carcinoma of the anus. Like its cervical counterpart, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), AIN is causally linked to persistent infections with high-risk HPV types such as HPV16 or HPV18. As AIN and CIN share distinct biological similar-ities, AIN screenings analogous to Pap smear programs for CIN have been recommended in high-risk populations to reduce the incidence of anal carcinoma. These screenings include cytological analysis followed by high resolution anoscopy in case of anal dysplasia. Treatment guidelines for AIN are not yet available. Therapeutic strategies can be divided into topical (e.g. trichloroacetic acid, podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, photodynamic therapy) and ablative (e. g. surgical excision, laser ablation, infrared coagulation, electrocautery) measures. However, controlled studies on AIN treatment have not been performed. The impact of HPV vaccination on AIN development will also need to be assessed. Long-term follow-up of these patients is essential to gain more insight into the natural history of anogenital HPV infection in HIV-positive MSM."
CD008054,0,19856423,1,Living with uncertainty: equivocal Pap test results and the evolution of ASC terminology.,"Communication of equivocal findings and their significance has been a significant challenge related to Pap testing throughout its history. Terminology to report these findings has changed considerably to accommodate the changes in understanding of cervical neoplasia, and to accommodate new management strategies, tests, and technologies. This article reviews the evolution of terminology for equivocal Pap test findings from the original Papanicolaou classification to the current the Bethesda System 2001 atypical squamous cells terminology, the implication and use of these terms, and the changing landscape of cervical neoplasia screening, which prompted these terminology changes. Emerging issues related to improving risk stratification through the introduction of additional terms and the impact of human papillomavirus testing may alter terminology of equivocal findings in the future."

In May 2008, the International Conference on Human Papillomavirus in Human Pathology was convened to review the latest evidence and to formulate consensus recommendations for the reduction of cervical cancer rates. The Czech Republic is spending considerable resources on cervical cancer prevention, but these resources are being used inefficiently. The current system is characterized by a lack of coordination and monitoring that leads to the over-screening of a minority of women while the majority of the target population are under-screened or not screened at all. It was recommended that a comprehensive, organized programme be implemented, coordinated by an independent administrative body with legal and budgetary responsibility. As the laboratory infrastructure and professional technical skills required for a quality-assured organized screening programme are already in place, implementation of this programme would not require much in the way of additional resources to produce substantial cost-effective reductions in cervical cancer rates."

Subjects were recruited from a nasopharyngeal carcinoma clinic and were segregated into group A: <60 years (n=25, 48+/-6 years, 5+/-5 years post-irradiation) and group B: >or=60 years (n=8, 67+/-4 years, 2+/-2 years post-irradiation) and were compared with age- and sex-matched normal individuals, group C: <60 years (n=20, 44+/-12 years) and group D: >or=60 years (n=10, 70+/-3 years). Selective culture of the oral rinse samples was carried out to isolate, quantify and speciate (using API 20E kit) aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci recovery. All test subjects were put under comprehensive oral and preventive care for 3 months, and 12 group A and 5 group B subjects were recalled for reassessment of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci colonization. All identical isolates, pre- and post-hygienic care, were phenotypically (Vitek, Hazelwood, MA and antibiogram profile) and genotypically (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) evaluated. The aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci isolated from the first round oral rinse samples included: Acinetobacter, Neisseria, Chryseomonas, Flavimonas, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Flavobacterium and Weeksella species. The aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci isolation rate was high for irradiated individuals, and they were 64/25% and 100/80% for groups A/C and B/D, respectively. Recovery of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae in oral rinse samples were found to be significantly more prevalent in the irradiated subjects (groups A and B). Enterobacteriaceae were more frequently isolated from oral rinse samples of aged irradiated subjects (group B vs D, P<0.05), where the quantity of Citrobacter freundii (colony-forming units/ml oral rinse) was also significantly elevated. The isolation rate of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci after hygienic care remained unchanged; 3 of 12 and 3 of 5 of the recalled subjects from groups A and B, respectively, harbored same aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci species. However, only two pairs of K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, sequentially isolated from same patients in group B, were found to be identical by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. This may be due to reinfection of the microbes from the same source or permanent colonization. In conclusion, irradiation-induced xerostomia seems to favor frequent, repeated, transient intraoral colonization of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and cocci."

(2) To work out a feasible strategy for follow up of Atypical squamous cells-undetermined significance (ASC-US) and Atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H) in resource limited settings. A total of 29,475 women were screened cytologically through Pap tests. The epithelial cell abnormalities (ECA) detected on screening were reviewed by the cytopathologists and classified according to Bethesda 2001 system. The women with ASC-US reports were followed up by two repeat cytology tests at 3 and 6 months of the initial visit. The persistent ASC-US cases or the cases which revealed squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) on follow up smears; as well as all ASC-H and above cases were referred for coloposcopic evaluation. ASC diagnosis comprised 3.6% of all reports. These were qualified as ASC-US (3.36%) and ASC-H (0.22%). On follow up, only 7 CIN 2 or worse (3.2%) lesions were detected on 218 biopsies in ASC-US category while in ASC-H qualifier 16 CIN 2 and above lesions (30.8%) were picked up on 52 colposcopic biopsies. The difference between ASC-US and ASC-H categories for a CIN 2 or worse outcome was highly significant (P < 0.001). ASC-H qualifier has a high likelihood for an ominous histological outcome and warrants an immediate colposcopic evaluation. On the other hand, ASC-US cases can be managed conservatively by repeat cytology tests at regular intervals without a significant risk of missing a high grade lesion. Diligent screening of cervical smears can judiciously downgrade some cases overcalled as ASC because of inflammatory atypia and thereby reduce referrals in geographic settings with high prevalence of reproductive tract infections. High risk HPV (HR HPV) testing may be a useful adjunct to further reduce referrals by selecting the women who require colposcopic evaluation."
CD008054,0,21128253,0,The prognostic significance of tumor human papillomavirus status for patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma treated with combined chemoradiotherapy.,"The prognostic relevance of tumor human papillomavirus (HPV) status in anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) had not been previously investigated, although its relevance to cervical, head and neck SCC is known. We retrospectively evaluated outcomes in 47 patients with anal SCC treated with combined chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and determined tumor HPV status by HPV DNA chip method and p16 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) from paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. The median age was 65 years (range, 44-90 years). Sixteen (34%) patients were diagnosed with T stage 3 to 4, and 18 (38%) patients had regional nodal disease (N-positive). Thirty-five (75%) patients were HPV positive, and 31 (66%) patients were genotype 16 (HPV16-positive). Thirty-nine (83.0%) patients were positive for p16. After median follow-up of 51.7 months (range, 5.1-136.0 months), HPV16-positive group had significantly better 4-year progression-free survival (PFS, 63.1% vs. 15.6%, p < 0.001) and overall survival (84.6% vs. 39.8%, p = 0.008) than HPV genotype 16 negative (HPV16-negative) group. Patients with p16-positive tumor also had a better 4-year PFS (52.5% vs. 25.0%, p = 0.014) than those with p16-negative tumor. In multivariate analysis for PFS, N-positive and HPV16-negative were independent prognostic factors for shorter PFS. Comparing patterns of failure, time to loco-regional failure was statistically superior in HPV16-positive over HPV16-negative groups (p = 0.006), but time to systemic failure was not different (p = 0.098). Tumor HPV genotype 16 status is a prognostic and predictive factor in anal SCC treated with CCRT, and p16 expression determined by IHC might be advocated as a surrogate biomarker of HPV integration in anal SCC. Further studies are warranted."
CD008054,0,15571057,0,Management of cervical cytologic abnormalities.,"The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology developed guidelines in 2001 for the management of cervical cytologic abnormalities. The guidelines incorporate the Bethesda System 2001 terminology and data from randomized studies of atypical squamous cells, low-grade intraepithelial lesions, human papillomavirus testing, and liquid-based cytology to formulate evidence-based recommendations. Each recommendation is graded according to the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence, and specific terminology is added to highlight management options. The effectiveness of each triage recommendation is determined by the percentage of grade 2 and 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia it detects. Colposcopy, repeat cytology, and human papillomavirus DNA testing are acceptable options in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, but human papillomavirus DNA testing is preferred if liquid-based cytology is used. Colposcopy is recommended for women with a diagnosis of ""atypical squamous cells-cannot rule out high-grade intraepithelial lesion."" Women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions should be referred for colposcopy, and women with high-grade lesions should undergo colposcopy and endocervical assessment. Colposcopy and endocervical sampling are recommended in women with all subcategories of atypical glandular cells. Endometrial sampling and colposcopy are recommended in women older than 35 years with atypical glandular cells and in younger women with unexplained vaginal bleeding. Women with a diagnosis of ""atypical glandular cells-favor neoplasia"" or adenocarcinoma-in-situ who are not found to have invasive disease on colposcopy should undergo a diagnostic excisional procedure, preferably a cold-knife conization."

We performed a prospective study including 781 women with normal, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL) cytology, and infected or not by high-risk (HR) HPV tested by Hybrid Capture II. Women were followed up every 6 months for a median period of 22 months. Among the HR-HPV-positive women at entry, more than half cleared their virus in 7.5 months; the clearance rate was greater for low viral loads than for high loads and also was higher in women with an initial ASCUS/LGSIL smear than in women with normal cytology. The incidence of cytologic abnormalities strongly depended on baseline viral load and HR-HPV persistence. Maintenance of cytologic abnormalities was associated with the outcome of HR-HPV status (negative<transient<persistent) but not with baseline load. Progression to CIN2/3+ was achieved only in women with persistent HR-HPV infection. The risk of CIN2/3+ also was increased with initial high loads (> or =100 pg/mL). Conversely, women who were consistently HR-HPV negative or transiently HR-HPV positive, whatever the cytology at baseline was, did not develop CIN2/3+ during follow-up. Age seemed to affect only the rate of incident HR-HPV infection. In conclusion, our data suggest that women repeatedly tested positive for HR-HPV are at risk of developing CIN2/3+, even when initial cytology is normal. A high viral load could be used as a short-term marker of progression toward precancerous lesions, although lower load does not inevitably exclude progressive disease."

The recognition of many similarities between cervical and anal cancer has stimulated research into the identification of a common aetiological agent. DNA from human papillomaviruses has consistently been found in both of these cancers and is thought to be an important factor in the development of both of these tumours. Simultaneously, epidemiological data from the west coast of America have indicated that the demography of anal cancer may be changing. Further studies in the USA and the UK have identified certain groups at high risk of developing anal cancer. These high-risk groups include 'never married' men and immunosuppressed patients both from iatrogenic immunosuppression in transplant patients and those infected with HIV. The potential increase in anal cancer cases, due to the ever increasing numbers of patients who have received transplants and the spiralling number of the population infected with HIV make it timely to review what is known of the aetiology, presentation and management of this cancer."

Nineteen women had had treatment for CIN between 1979 and 1989, 7 laser ablation, 9 cone biopsy, 2 laser ablation and cone biopsy, and one woman laser ablation, cauterization and cone biopsy. At 10-year follow-up in 1989 4/100 women had anogenital warts, 12/100 women had cytological evidence of CIN (7 low grade, 5 high grade), and 37/100 women had CIN detected on colposcopic biopsy (31 low grade, 6 high grade). No women developed invasive cervical carcinoma during the study period. CIN lesions, detected in 1979, regressed without any treatment in 2 women. Colposcopic biopsy was 3.1 times more sensitive than single cervical PAP smear at detecting CIN (4.4 times as sensitive in detecting low grade CIN; 1.2 times as sensitive in detecting high grade CIN). In 1989 CIN was detected in 7/19 (36.8%) of women who had undergone cervical treatment between 1979 and 1989, and in 35/81 (43.2%) of women having no cervical treatment within this period (chi squared P greater than 0.5). These findings suggest that cervical laser ablative therapy and cone biopsy do not in the long term influence the natural history of cervical human papilloma virus-associated disease (CIN) in women with anogenital warts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

However, better management of cervical cancer rests on good diagnosis and an effective therapy. In this study we evaluated the frequency of point mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for future use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in clinical treatment and to assess the use of EGFR, p16INK4a and E-cadherin as biomarkers in cervical cancer diagnosis with immunohistochemistry. Fifty-three patient specimens of cervical cancer were analysed for HPV infection, for EGFR mutations in exons 18 through 21, and for expression of EGFR, p16INK4a and E-cadherin by immunostaining. Results showed that 79.24% of the cases (42/53) are HPV positive and the HPV types more closely associated with risk are HPV 16 and 18. In all 53 analysed specimens, any mutation affecting the EGFR kinase domain in exons 18 through 21 was observed. Expressions of EGFR, p16INK4a and E-cadherin were detected in 88,67% (47/53), 92,45% (49/53) and 79,24% (42/53) of analysed specimens respectively. Thus, EGFR, p16INK4a and E-cadherin would be excellent tools for IHC analysis during the cervical cancer development. EGFR and p16INK4a can be used for early diagnosis and E-cadherin for cancer progression and cell migration. However, treatment of cervical cancer with TKIs may not be effective and the identification of other EGFR inhibitors is needed."

Hence, unlike p16ink4 expression (p < or = 0.001), a correlation between the increase in the number of those infected with papillomavirus was not significantly higher than that of dysplasia grade (p < or = 0.05). It is suggested that combined use of liquid cytology and immunohistochemical assay of p16ink4 is more effective."
CD008054,0,15613855,0,Benign epithelioid peripheral nerve sheath tumors of the soft tissues: clinicopathologic spectrum of 33 cases.,"Benign epithelioid peripheral nerve sheath tumors (BEPNSTs) have not been fully characterized, and their relationship to conventional schwannoma and neurofibroma has not been satisfactorily established. Herein, we detail the clinicopathologic features of 33 examples of BEPNST. The study included 22 females and 11 males ranging in age from 2 to 68 years (median, 31.5 years). Only one patient probably has neurofibromatosis type 1. The tumors were predominantly dermal/subcutaneous in location (85%) and involved the lower limb (n=15), upper limb (n=11), trunk (n=4), and head/neck (n=3). The lesions ranged in size from 0.3 to 6.8 cm (median, 1.1 cm). Microscopically, the tumors were generally well-circumscribed, uninodular, or multinodular masses. Twenty-six lesions were encapsulated. Tumors consisted of trabeculae, loosely arranged nodules, and cohesive nests of epithelioid tumor cells immersed in collagenous, myxohyaline, or chiefly myxoid stroma. A bland spindled cell component comprising 5% to 40% of the tumor was noted in 15 cases. Mitotic activity ranged from 0 to 6 mitoses/50 high power fields (mean, 1.5 mitoses/50 high power fields) with no abnormal division figures identified. Five lesions were considered atypical based on presence of focal nuclear/nucleolar enlargement and hyperchromasia. Immunohistochemical reactivity for Schwann cell-related markers in tumor cells included S-100 protein (20 of 20 cases), collagen type IV (10 of 10), laminin (8 of 8), nerve growth factor receptor, p75(7 of 8), CD57 (6 of 9), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (8 of 15). CD34-positive fibroblast-like cells were identified in all 12 neoplasms tested. Anti-epithelial membrane antigen highlighted perineurial cells in 9 of the 11 encapsulated tumors. Anti-neurofilament protein did not identify intralesional neuraxons in the 10 tumors evaluated. Eighteen tumors were subtyped as epithelioid neurofibromas. The remaining 15 cases showed some histologic features suggestive of schwannoma, but their uniform cellularity, absence of nuclear palisading, and presence of a significant CD34-positive spindled cell population in 5 cases led to their classification as ""BEPNST of indeterminate histogenesis."" Evaluation for loss of heterozygosity in 2 cases demonstrated deletion of genetic material on chromosome 22q and 17q involving NF2 and NF1 loci. However, sequencing of NF2 coding sequences revealed no mutations. Follow-up for 18 patients (median interval, 13.5 years), including 4 patients with tumors exhibiting cytologic atypia, revealed a nondestructive recurrence or persistent disease in 3 patients whose tumors lacked atypia, but no evidence of metastatic spread or tumor-related death. BEPNSTs are usually small neoplasms located in superficial soft tissue and have an excellent prognosis after complete local excision. Accurate subclassification of some of these lesions is difficult based on currently available techniques."
CD008054,0,18349293,0,International correlation between human papillomavirus prevalence and cervical cancer incidence.,"Data from population-based human papillomavirus (HPV) surveys in regions of low, intermediate, and high cervical cancer incidence were used to study the ecologic correlation between high-risk HPV prevalence and cervical cancer incidence. All the surveys were conducted by the IARC according to a standardized protocol for the collection of female population samples and detection of HPV DNA using PCR assay in a central laboratory. Cervical cancer incidence data were extracted, when available, from a cancer registry covering the surrounding or nearby area of the prevalence survey. Thirteen areas were included in this analysis. The relation between high-risk HPV prevalence and cervical cancer incidence was investigated within 10-year age groups from age 25 to 65 years. A Poisson regression model was used to predict cervical cancer incidence from HPV prevalence, and the strength of the correlation was assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The rank correlation was weakest in women ages 25 to 34 years and strongest in women ages 55 to 64 years. In addition, the prevalence of high-risk HPV was not able to predict cervical cancer incidence accurately in every country. Nevertheless, our data raise a concern about the cervical cancer burden in areas where reliable cervical cancer statistics do not exist but where the prevalence of high-risk HPV in women over age 45 is high."
CD008054,0,20717168,0,"Cervix smear abnormalities: linking pathology data in female twins, their mothers and sisters.","Mass screening for cervical cancer precursors has decreased the incidence of cervical cancer in several countries, including the Netherlands. Persistent infections of certain types of human papillomavirus are strongly associated with the development of cervical cancer. A number of factors may affect the liability to infection and subsequent progression to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer. This paper examines whether genetic factors are involved in explaining individual differences in liability. Data of 3178 women registered with the Netherlands Twin Register were successfully linked to the nationwide Dutch Pathology database that contains all results of mass screening for cervical cancer. The data from mono- and dizygotic twins and their female relatives were used to disentangle the influence of heritable and environmental factors on cervix smear abnormalities. Results showed that differences in cervix smear results clustered within families and resemblance was stronger in monozygotic twins (correlation 0.37, 95% confidence interval: 0.12-0.58) compared with other first-degree relatives (correlation 0.14, 95% confidence interval: -0.01-0.29). The familial clustering for an abnormal cervix smear is due to shared genetic factors that explain 37% of the variance in liability. The largest proportion of the variation in cervical smear abnormalities is due to unique environmental factors."

CD008054,0,19739071,0,Comparison of HPV and cytology triage algorithms for women with borderline or mild dyskaryosis in population-based cervical screening (VUSA-screen study).,"We studied the effectiveness of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) triage for immediate colposcopy in women with borderline or mild dyskaryosis (BMD). In the Utrecht province of the Netherlands, women aged 30-60 years who participated in the regular cervical screening programme were offered hrHPV testing and cytology (intervention group) or cytology only (control group). In the intervention group (n = 337), women with BMD were immediately referred for colposcopy only if the sample was hrHPV positive. Women with a hrHPV negative test were advised to repeat cytology at 6 and 18 months and were referred for colposcopy if and when the repeat test result was positive (BMD or worse). In the control group (n = 329), referral of women with BMD was delayed until cytology was repeatedly positive at 6 or 18 months. The CIN3 detection rates were 10.7% (36/337) in the intervention group and 6.4% (21/329) in the control group (p = 0.047). Moreover, hrHPV triaging resulted in shorter time to diagnosis (154 vs. 381 days). Although the number of colposcopy referrals was 51.5% higher in the intervention group than in the control group, the medical costs per detected CIN3 were slightly lower ([euro] 4781 vs. [euro] 6235). If, in addition, hrHPV negative women had been referred back to routine screening at baseline, the CIN3 rate would have been 10.1% (34/337) and colposcopy rate would only have been 30.4% higher than in the control group. This study shows that hrHPV triaging of women with BMD is at least as effective for detecting CIN3 as repeat cytology, also when hrHPV negative women are referred back to routine screening."

The ability to generate preparative amounts of HPV-16 L1/L2 VLPs and E6, E7 proteins may have implications for the development of a serologic assay to detect anti-HPV-16 virion immune responses. The purpose of the study is to improve the way of proper management of the cervical cancer by investigating the utility of the recently developed HPV-16 L1/L2 VLPs, HPV-16 E6, E7 proteins as the clinical serologic markers through antibody reactions by comparison with those of SCCA and CEA which have been used as tumor markers for cervical cancer."

CD008054,0,14515082,0,Current theories for the development of nonsmoking and nondrinking laryngeal carcinoma.,"The pivotal risk of smoking and alcohol in laryngeal cancer has meant that evidence for alternate cofactors has been indicative to date. A number of case series, however, contain a few patients who are life-long nondrinkers and nonsmokers and question what other cofactors may contribute. Gastroesophageal reflux disease makes a small but significant contribution to the causal development of laryngeal cancer; however, what remains to be understood is the mechanism of its action. Bile reflux appears to be an additional causative factor in achlorhydrics. After controlling for the effects of alcohol and tobacco, exposure to oncogenic types of human papilloma virus is associated with an increased risk of laryngeal carcinoma. Evidence does not support asbestos exposure itself as increasing the relative risk of laryngeal cancer. A dietary increase in vegetables and fruit may confer an advantage in reducing the laryngeal cancer incidence. Inherited differences in cell cycle control systems, DNA repair systems, and carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes can increase the risk for laryngeal cancer, but as yet, no causal mechanism has been demonstrated."

CD008054,0,20011297,0,Colon cancer screening update and management of the malignant polyp.,"Colorectal carcinoma is common, but screening for this cancer has found less acceptance with the public than screening for breast, prostate, and cervical cancer. Available methods include fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FOS), double-contrast barium enema, colonoscopy, computed tomographic colography, and fecal DNA. Evaluation of these options demonstrates that colonoscopy at ages 55 and 65 offers the best combination of reduction in colorectal cancer at the lowest cost. However, when compliance with screening recommendations is very high, costs are high, and the proportion of cancers arising from adenomas is low, the combination of FOS and FOBT is most cost effective. Malignant polyps look friable and irregular and feel hard. Sessile malignant polyps need to be treated by formal resection. Patients with pedunculated polyps with favorable histology (clear margin, well or moderately differentiated, no lymphovascular invasion) can be observed, and those whose polyps show unfavorable histology should have the polyp-bearing segment of colon resected along with its draining lymph nodes."

CD008054,0,10975554,0,New technologies in cervical cancer precursor detection.,"The current literature reflects three routes toward improving cervical cancer screening. The first is to improve the test qualities of cytology-based screening. The use of liquid-based cytology and computerized analysis of Papanicolaou tests are examples of attempts at this approach. Secondly, through various combinations of parallel or sequential tests, either the sensitivity or the specificity of a given test could be improved depending on the tests chosen and the order in which they were performed (eg, Papanicolaou test followed by human papillomavirus [HPV] or vice versa). Several excellent studies have been published this year on the use of HPV DNA testing as a primary screening modality and as an adjunct to the triage of mildly abnormal cytologic findings. The recent literature also reflects increasing interest in visual inspection of the cervix and self-collected samples for HPV testing as an equally effective and viable alternative to cytology in low-resource settings. A third possibility is to make use of advances in digital and spectroscopic techniques. In these cost-conscious times, a significant number of articles address the cost-effectiveness of these technologies and the real value of cervical cancer screening. This article reviews the current literature concerning both the advent of new cervical cancer screening technologies and the rediscovery of old ones."

Fifty patients with abnormal Papanicolaou smears and histological evidence of cervical HPV infection associated or not with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade I were randomized to either a treatment or a control group. The cervical swabs were obtained every 3 months in both groups and examined for HPV type 16 DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. After a follow-up period of 12 months no significant differences were found between the laser treatment and the control groups in relation to the disappearance of the abnormal Papanicolaou smear. Two patients in the treatment group and 3 in the control group had a conization because of development of CIN I or aggravation of the concomitant CIN found at the initial visit. The percentage of women who demonstrated HPV in their cervical smears at 12 months' follow-up was identical in the two groups, supporting the hypothesis that HPV is a persistent infection during which the virus is widespread in the vaginal epithelium."
CD008054,0,16850495,0,"Upregulation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is related to the grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, but is not an independent predictor of high-risk human papillomavirus or disease outcome in cervical cancer.","Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) has a pivotal function in controlling a wide variety of gene functions, and has shown to be constitutively activated in many human cancers. The molecular links of NF-kappaB to oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions and its prognostic value in cervical cancer (CC) are incompletely understood. As part of our HPV-PathogenISS study, a series of 150 squamous-cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 152 CIN lesions were examined using immunohistochemical staining for NF-kappaB, and tested for HPV using PCR with three primer sets (MY09/11, GP5+/GP6+, and SPF). Follow-up data were available from all SCC patients, and 67 CIN lesions had been monitored with serial PCR for HPV clearance/persistence after cone treatment. Cytoplasmic NF-kappaB expression was associated with CIN3/cancer at OR 3.55 (95% CI, 1.79-7.05), while nuclear NF-kappaB expression had an OR of 21.90 (95% CI, 2.96-161.74) (P = 0.0001). Strong nuclear expression was a rare event (8.8%) also in CC, but it was related to high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) detection, with OR 2.15 (95% CI, 1.08-4.30) (P = 0.022). This association was confounded, however, by the histological grade (Mantel-Haenszel common OR = 1.46; 95% CI, 0.70-3.03) (P = 0.308). Cytoplasmic or nuclear NF-kappaB expression did not predict clearance/persistence of HR-HPV after treatment of CIN, and neither one proved to be a prognostic predictor in CC. Overexpression of cytoplasmic NF-kappaB is significantly associated with progression to CIN3 and cancer. This is paralleled by only a slight increase in nuclear expression of NF-kappaB, which could be explained by the mechanisms whereby HR-HPVs escape from the transcriptional control of NF-kappaB, i.e., E7-mediated impaired nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic NF-kappaB, and E6-conditioned attenuated NF-kappaB (p65)-dependent transcriptional activity."

Questionnaires were distributed to 852 Korean obstetricians and gynecologists, who attended the 91st Conference of the Korean Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology held during May, 2005. Questionnaires were returned by 30.6% (260/852) of the recipients and 254 of these were eligible for analysis. Sixty-seven percent started cervical cancer screening women at age 20, and 65% replied that they would continue annual screening in a 35-yr-old woman with three consecutive normal cytologic tests. Over 65% of respondents preferred conventional cytologic screening to liquid-based cytology. The cost was a major determinant for selecting screening method. Fifty-three percent used the human papillomavirus DNA test as a triage for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. Our findings suggest that majority of Korean obstetricians and gynecologists in hospital prefer annual conventional cytologic testing to liquid-based cytology for financial reason."

CD008054,0,18691459,0,Controversies in the management of oropharynx cancer.,"Squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx account for approximately 25% of all head and neck squamous cell malignancies. Most patients present with locally advanced tumors and require a multimodality approach to treatment, with input from qualified surgeons and radiation and medical oncologists. For organ preservation, concurrent chemoradiotherapy is usually preferred over surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy. Controversies regarding management of particular populations of locally advanced oropharyngeal tumors exist, including whether to include induction chemotherapy before chemoradiation, the use of biologic agents as radiation sensitizers, and how best to manage the neck after definitive treatment. Additionally, infection with human papilloma virus (HPV), particularly HPV-16, is now an established risk factor for head and neck cancer. Most cases involve the oropharynx, and prognosis seems to be much better than for patients with non-HPV- and tobacco-related tumors. Given the distinct differences between these HPV and non-HPV-related cancers, controversy also exists regarding the management of these patient populations, with the concern that HPV-related malignancies may be overtreated. Unfortunately, these and other questions concerning the management of locally advanced oropharyngeal cancers are outstanding. Hence, it is critical that eligible patients are screened for and encouraged to participate in clinical trials."

Cervical screening has saved hundreds of thousands of lives but has not been available to women in the poorest countries. In countries where wide coverage has been achieved and quality assurance is in place, incidence and death rates have fallen by over 50% even though cervical cytology is logistically complex. The management of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is very effective, but low-grade cytological abnormalities require care to avoid over-treatment. The increasing rate of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and the prospect of prophylactic vaccination will change the way cervical cytology is used, possibly giving way to HPV testing as the primary test in secondary prevention."

Sixty-four percent of the sampled women under 30 had detectable high risk HPV DNA, decreasing to 44% in 30--39 year olds and to 27% in women over 40. High risk HPV prevalence increased with severity of cytology, although 22% with normal colposcopy had detectable high risk HPV. Of those women treated for cervical dysplasia, 83% had detectable high risk HPV prior to treatment, compared to only 32% afterwards. The audit has shown that high risk HPV testing has considerable discriminatory value. It has been integrated successfully into the service, particularly to manage low grade cervical abnormalities and to add valuable information following treatment for cervical dysplasia. Results need to be interpreted alongside colposcopy, cytology, and histology, and care must be taken in the interpretation of a single high risk HPV result."

Treatment for opportunistic and sexually transmitted infections and reproductive tract infections was provided. Women with Pap smear abnormality were referred for further intervention. Between January 2003 and May 2004, 287 HIV-infected women were enrolled. Pap smear abnormalities were seen in 6.3% women and were more common among women aged 30 and above (P=0.042) and those who had suffered from opportunistic infections (P=0.004). In multivariate analysis, Pap smear abnormalities were associated independently with opportunistic infections (P=0.02, AOR 3.8, 95% CI 1.2--11.5). Of the 100 random cervical specimens screened for HPV 16 and 18 genotypes, 33% (95 CI 23.9--43.1) were positive for HPV 16/18. Of the 122 patients who returned for a follow-up visit, 5 patients (4.1%) who did not have Pap smear abnormality at baseline, had developed Pap smear abnormality.

In the case of papillary cancer the multivariate analysis for the ploidy shows a strong and independent influence on the prognosis. Even when comparing with tumor stage, EORTC score and AGES score the ploidy allows an additional prognostic differentiation.

An incisional biopsy revealed a diffuse, mixed cellular infiltrate, consisting of benign lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes, and foci rich in eosinophils. Within this background was a scattering of large, atypical cells, including Reed-Sternberg forms that exhibited immunoreactivity for CD30 and CD20 and nonreactivity for CD15 and CD45RO, supporting a diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Positron emission tomography exhibited a single focal area of abnormal hypermetabolic activity involving the left palate area, without involvement of any other site.

However, few and contradictory studies have been made on laryngeal carcinomas. We studied 48 epidermoid carcinomas in patients subjected to horizontal supraglottic laryngectomy with a 5-year- followup. The technique described by Hedley for fixated and paraffin-embedded tumors was used. Thirteen tumors were excluded on the grounds of presenting variation coefficients in excess of 10. Of the 35 cases analyzed, 28 (80%) were diploid and seven (20%) aneuploid. No correlation was observed between tumor ploidy and patient survival, recurrence, or any of the histopathological variables studied."
CD008054,0,21147950,0,Aptima HPV E6/E7 mRNA test is as sensitive as Hybrid Capture 2 Assay but more specific at detecting cervical precancer and cancer.,"Detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) E6/E7 oncogene expression may be more predictive of cervical cancer risk than testing for HPV DNA. The Aptima HPV test (Gen-Probe) detects E6/E7 mRNA of 14 oncogenic types. Its clinical performance was compared with that of the Hybrid Capture 2 DNA test (HC2; Qiagen) in women referred for colposcopy and those routinely screened. Aptima was also compared with the PreTect HPV-Proofer E6/E7 mRNA assay (Proofer; Norchip) in the referral population. Cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt (Hologic Inc.) were processed for HPV detection and genotyping with the Linear Array (LA) method (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Laval, Quebec, Canada). Histology-confirmed high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2) or worse (CIN 2+) served as the disease endpoint. On the basis of 1,418 referral cases (CIN 2+, n = 401), the sensitivity of Aptima was 96.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.4, 98.2), whereas it was 94.3% (95% CI, 92.0, 96.6) for HC2. The specificities were 43.2% (95% CI, 40.2, 46.2) and 38.7% (95% CI, 35.7, 41.7), respectively (P < 0.05). In 1,373 women undergoing routine screening (CIN 2+, n = 7), both Aptima and HC2 showed 100% sensitivity, and the specificities were 88.3% (95% CI, 86.6, 90.0) and 85.3% (95% CI, 83.5, 87.3), respectively (P < 0.05); for women â¥ 30 years of age (n = 845), the specificities were 93.9% (95% CI, 92.3, 95.5) and 92.1% (95% CI, 90.3, 93.9), respectively (P < 0.05). On the basis of 818 referral cases (CIN 2+, n = 235), the sensitivity of Aptima was 94.9% (95% CI, 92.1, 97.7) and that of Proofer was 79.1% (95% CI, 73.9, 84.3), and the specificities were 45.8% (95% CI, 41.8, 49.8) and 75.1% (95% CI, 71.6, 78.6), respectively (P < 0.05). Both Aptima and Proofer showed a higher degree of agreement with LA genotyping than HC2. In conclusion, the Aptima test is as sensitive as HC2 but more specific for detecting CIN 2+ and can serve as a reliable test for both primary cervical cancer screening and the triage of borderline cytological abnormalities."
CD008054,0,17229186,0,Management of advanced HIV disease with no other complications in women and in Africans.,"The number of patients who present with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease [defined as a helper lymphocyte (CD4) count <50 cells/mm3 or the presence of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness] is increasing. In the USA during 1994-1999, a relatively stable proportion of 43% of people diagnosed with HIV infection were tested late in the infection (had AIDS diagnosed within 1 year of diagnosis). A recent review of newly diagnosed infections in 2003 found that 301/977 (31%) of patients in the UK and Ireland presented late (<200 CD4 cells/mm3). Before a diagnosis is made, patients with advanced disease do not benefit from antiretroviral therapy and may continue to transmit the infection to others. Furthermore, when antiretroviral therapy is initiated in patients with CD4 counts of 201-350 cells/mm(3), the risk of death is lower than when treatment is started at lower CD4 cell counts. With the increasing prevalence of HIV in women and African immigrants, some doctors are concerned that different management approaches need to be used in these groups. This article reviews the evidence and some clinical scenarios for patients with advanced disease without complications and women and Africans who may present with advanced HIV disease. The aim is to offer practical advice on therapeutic options for treatment-naÃ¯ve patients who present with advanced HIV disease on the basis of available clinical evidence."
CD008054,0,11549431,0,Early withdrawal from cervical cancer screening: the question of cost-effectiveness.,"In countries such as the UK, mass population screening for cervical cancer has been undertaken since the 1960s. Although of established effectiveness, no formal evaluation of the screening protocol was carried out prior to its implementation. On the basis of a published mathematical modelling exercise, it has been speculated that withdrawing women from the screening programme at an earlier age than at present, whilst leading to a higher rate of invasive cervical cancer (ICC), could reduce resource use. Using estimates of screening and treatment costs, and of expected life-years lost following earlier withdrawal, we simulated cost-effectiveness ratios for various scenarios described by the model. Median cost savings resulting from a life-year lost never exceeded pound10000 for any scenario, although the estimates were particularly sensitive to the assumed age at cancer presentation and the rate of cancer progression. Our findings seem to offer little economic support for the early withdrawal of subjects from the cervical screening programme."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between HPV 16 and 18 viral loads and cervical status in different age strata. A duplex real time PCR method was devised to determine HPV 16 and 18 viral load per million of human cells using an in house plasmidic construct as a standard of quantification. The 151 cervical scrapes were collected before colposcopic examination from either abnormal cervico-vaginal smear (group 1, 97 patients) or from post treatment clinical follow-up (group 2, 54 patients). In women aged 30-40, the HPV16 viral loads were significantly higher in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion than in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion in both groups and HPV18 in group 1. In women aged 20-30 of group 1, high HPV viral load was associated in few cases with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and surprisingly in some patients with normal cervix. HPV 16 and 18 viral loads are related to the severity of cervical lesion, and may be useful in the clinical management of cervical lesions. A specific follow-up may be useful for those with high viral load despite normal cervix."

The options for management of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1, 2, and 3 are ranked according to the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence. Follow-up with repeat cytology at six and 12 months or DNA testing for high-risk types of human papillomavirus at 12 months is the preferred management approach for women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 and satisfactory initial colposcopy. If results from repeat cytology are reported as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or greater, or if DNA human papillomavirus testing is positive for oncogenic types of the virus, repeat colposcopy is preferred. When the initial colposcopy is unsatisfactory, a diagnostic excisional procedure is preferred. Follow-up without treatment is acceptable only in women who are pregnant and adolescents with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 who had unsatisfactory colposcopy. Biopsy-confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 and 3 requires treatment except during pregnancy and in compliant adolescents with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 and negative endocervical curettage. When colposcopy is satisfactory, treatment includes ablative or excisional procedures. A diagnostic excisional procedure is recommended in women with biopsy-confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3 and unsatisfactory colposcopy."

The utility of DNA analysis in postirradiation smears was evaluated retrospectively in 71 patients. Representative Papanicolaou smears were restained with a Feulgen method and 100 to 250 cells were analyzed for DNA content using the CAS 200 image analysis system. Thirty-three control irradiated patients had negative smears with a minimum 3-year follow-up. Thirty controls (91%) had diploid histograms with a mean coefficient of variation of 8.2% and an average of 6.8% of cells in S and G2/M phase. Three control patients had atypical nondiagnostic histograms. Twenty-three patients had abnormal smears and subsequent local recurrence; 21 (91%) had abnormal histograms, with seven showing polyploidy and 14 showing aneuploidy. The remaining 15 patients had abnormal smears diagnosed as PRD but no evidence of recurrent carcinoma. Five were polyploid, six were aneuploid, one was diploid, and three were atypical but nondiagnostic. Interactive DNA cytometry is useful in differentiating BRC from PRD and recurrent cancer. Aneuploidy is rarely, if ever, seen in negative smears with BRC. However, BRC may be associated with broad diploid peaks and increased proliferating cells. An abnormal histogram can be seen with PRD and does not always correlate with recurrent disease."

CD008054,0,19741545,0,Prevalence and distribution of high-risk human papillomavirus in Greece.,"As knowledge of regional human papillomavirus (HPV) type distribution is essential for the optimization of prevention strategies, this study was carried out to explore the prevalence and type distribution of high-risk HPV in a screening population across Greece. Cervical samples were collected by local physicians and nurses in hospitals and health centers across the country from 4139 women attending for cervical cancer screening. High-risk HPV-DNA was detected by using Hybrid Capture-2 (HC2) and positive samples with adequate cellular content were further typed by restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction. Almost six percent (5.9%) of women tested positive in HC2. The most common type was HPV16 (1.4% in the whole sample and 32.4% of the typed samples), followed by HPV53 (0.6 and 14.0%, respectively), HPV31 (0.6 and 12.9%, respectively), HPV35 (0.5 and 12.3%, respectively), HPV51 (0.4 and 7.8%, respectively), HPV18 (0.3 and 7.3%, respectively) and 22 more types. Almost 15% of the typed samples showed a coinfection with two HPV types and 2.1% with three types. There was a bimodal distribution by age, with the highest peak in women 20-29 years old and a lower peak in women 50-59 years old. Apart from the types originally included in HC2 cocktail, PCR analysis identified 15 more types (HPV6, HPV11, HPV34, HPV37, HPV38, HPV42, HPV53, HPV54, HPV55, HPV61, HPV62, HPV66, HPV73, HPV82, HPV83). Eleven percent of HC2-positive results arose from single-type infections with HPV53 (10%) and HPV66 (1%), which are potentially high-risk types. In conclusion, HPV16 is the most common type in the largest Greek screening sample used to date and, together with its related types, accounts for more than half of high-risk HPV infections. Approximately 10% of positive HC2 results arise from HPV53, which is not normally detected by the test, but may be clinically significant."

Of these, 23 tumors (11%) that preferentially localized to the tonsils revealed complete absence or dramatic reduction in the amount of pRb. Other cell cycle components, cyclin D1 and p16INK4A, which are intimately related to pRb through an autoregulatory loop, were also dramatically decreased or overexpressed, respectively, in these pRb-defective tumors. On the other hand, the majority of the pRb-defective tumors contained the wild-type p53 gene. No evidence was found for genetic defects at the Rb locus in these tumors. Very significantly, in 11 of 12 pRb-defective tonsillar tumors, but in none of 9 pRb-positive tonsillar tumors (P < 10[-7]), DNA of oncogenic human papillomavirus types was identified, providing a strong indication for a human papillomavirus-associated etiology of these tumors and suggesting the functional inactivation of the pRb protein by the viral E7 gene product. In comparison to all head and neck squamous cell carcinomas studied, the pRb-defective tonsillar tumors were in general more poorly differentiated (P = 0.0059), and they were all metastatic at the time of resection. Of particular clinical interest, despite these adverse histopathological factors, the clinical outcome for these patients was relatively favorable, strongly implying that the pRb-defective tumors responded uniformly well toward postoperative radiation therapy."

A computer search identified 426 LSIL, 86 ASC-H, 81 LSIL-H, and 110 HSIL cytologic interpretations during a 1-year period, each with up to 2 years of histologic follow-up. The risk of histologic cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or worse (CIN 2+) associated with LSIL-H (32/81 [40%]) was intermediate between LSIL (46/426 [10.8%]) and HSIL (72/110 [65.5%]), but not significantly different from ASC-H (23/86 [27%]). However, LSIL-H was more frequently associated with a definitive histologic diagnosis of any CIN (CIN 1+) than ASC-H (53/81 [65%] vs 35/86 [41%]). Moreover, the prevalence of HR-HPV was significantly greater in patients with LSIL-H than in patients with ASC-H (15/15 [100%] vs 43/73 [59%]).

The incidence of cervical neoplasia, according to previous studies, is 11%; this tumor is the only one that can be investigated by screening before and after a graft. Our purpose was to evaluate whether transplanted patients showed an increased incidence of genital human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and whether this infection produced greater progression of disease in cases of low-risk HPV infections. Our study involved 151 transplant patients who underwent Papanicolaou (Pap) and HPV tests. Patients listed for grafts underwent Pap and HPV tests 6 months before and 6 months after transplantation. All patients had negative Pap tests before their grafts. After their grafts 16 patients (10.59%) had negative Pap tests, but positive viral typing. Eleven patients (7.28%) showed positive Pap tests, 6 of whom had low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) and 5 patients high-grade SIL. The final HPV infection incidence (15.23%) was consistent with the literature. The incidence of lower female genital tract intraepithelial lesions (7.28%) was higher than the healthy population or analogous studies (4.5%-8.5%). We showed a constant association between high-risk HPV infection and gynecologic intraepithelial neoplasia, whereas there was no association between low-risk broods HPV infection and neoplasia. In conclusion, screening should start at almost 6 months before grafting to avoid an irreversible situation that is difficult to treat."

CD008054,0,8380681,0,Basaloid and warty carcinomas of the vulva. Distinctive types of squamous cell carcinoma frequently associated with human papillomaviruses.,"In a previous study, we described an elevated prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in two specific types of squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva designated basaloid carcinoma (BC) and warty carcinoma (WC) compared with the conventional type of keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (KSC). To determine whether there were other differences in their clinical presentation or behavior, we examined 100 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva classified as BC (28 cases), WC (seven cases), and KSC (65 cases). We included only cases in which tissue adjacent to the tumor was present so that the presence of intraepithelial lesions (squamous hyperplasia, lichen sclerosus, and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia [VIN]) could be correlated with the different types of invasive carcinomas. Microscopically, BC was characterized by a relatively uniform population of small, ovoid cells with a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio resembling VIN 3. Although WC was similar to typical squamous cell carcinoma, it contained many squamous cells that displayed marked nuclear pleomorphism, enlargement, atypia, and multinucleation in conjunction with cytoplasmic cavitation resembling koilocytotic atypia in intraepithelial lesions. The majority of the women with BC and WC were less than 60 years of age, and the proportion of black women was higher as compared with the women with KSC, the majority of whom were white and over 65 years of age. On crude comparison, women with BC appeared to have a survival advantage compared with women with KSC; however, through multivariate modelling, when all possible confounding variables were taken into account, there was little residual impression of a survival advantage of women with BC compared with those having KSC. Substantial differences were found among the three types of carcinoma with regard to the prevalence of adjacent intraepithelial lesions. Squamous hyperplasia was found adjacent to KSC in 54 (83%) of the 65 cases, whereas 27 (77%) of 35 cases of BC and WC had adjacent basaloid or warty VIN. These findings suggest that VIN is a precursor of BC and WC. In view of the high frequency of HPV-DNA detected in VIN and in BC and WC, the findings support the view that HPV has a role in the development of these tumors. In addition, a difference was found in the distribution of associated cervical and vaginal tumors with the three types of vulvar carcinomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Human papillomavirus.","More than 15 years ago, a relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer was recognized. Since then, important strides in understanding the virus have been made, particularly in the following areas: modes of transmission and risk factors associated with transmission; the oncogenic potential of specific viral types and the mechanism by which they cause cancer; and the spectrum of infection, ranging from asymptomatic carrier states to overt warts, preneoplastic lesions, and invasive cancer. Sophisticated new tests for the detection of HPV that hold great promise for improved screening for cervical cancer precursors and invasive cancer and for the triage of abnormal cervical cytology also have been developed. Understanding the immunology of HPV has allowed the development of new and more effective treatment modalities for HPV infection and the preliminary development of primary prevention modalities, including HPV vaccines."
CD008054,0,15539382,0,"Activation of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is related to grade of the lesion but not to high-risk human papillomavirus, virus clearance, or prognosis in cervical cancer.","We subjected 302 archival samples (150 squamous cell carcinomas [SCCs] and 152 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] lesions) to immunohistochemical staining with extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 (ERK1) antibody and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing with 3 primer sets. Follow-up data were available for all SCC cases and 67 CIN cases. High-risk (HR) HPV types were associated with CIN (odds ratio [OR], 19.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.31-157.81) and SCC (OR, 27.25; 95% CI, 3.28226.09). There was a significant linear relationship between lesion grade and ERK1 staining intensity (P = .0001). ERK1 staining was a 100% specific indicator of CIN, with a 100% positive predictive value, but a poor predictor of HR HPV. ERK1 expression did not predict clearance or persistence of HR HPV after CIN treatment. ERK1 staining did not significantly predict survival in cervical cancer in univariate (P = .915) or multivariate analysis. After adjustment for HR HPV, stage, age, and tumor grade in the Cox regression model, only stage (P = .0001) and age (P = .002) remained independent prognostic factors. ERK1 expression seems to be an early marker of cervical carcinogenesis. ERK1 overexpression is not a specific marker of HR-HPV in CIN and cervical cancer, nor does it predict virus clearance after CIN treatment or disease outcome in cervical cancer."

The results were compared with 121 follow-up biopsy specimens. p16(INK4a) was positive in 57.9% of women with LSIL compared with 97.1% of women with HSIL. In contrast, HC2 testing was positive in 85.0% of women with LSIL and 86.4% of women with HSIL. The differences in the positive rates for16(INK4a) between LSIL and HSIL was significant (P < .001), whereas, for HC2, it was not (P = .264). In patients who had cervical biopsies following a cytologic diagnosis of LSIL, the positive predictive value (PPV) of p16(INK4a) for a biopsy of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN2/3; 33.3%) was significantly higher than the PPV of HC2 results (21.2%) (P < .001). Using liquid-based cytology specimens, p16(INK4a) immunocytochemical analysis has a higher PPV than reflex HC2 HPV testing for identifying CIN2/3 among patients with LSIL and might be useful for selecting patients with LSIL for colposcopy."
CD008054,0,16886157,0,Genital human papillomavirus infection.,"Over the past few decades, epidemiology and natural history studies have led to improved understanding of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and to promising prevention strategies. HPV infection is the cause of anogenital warts and cervical cancer, as well as a proportion of other anogenital and head and neck cancers. Data from clinical trials have resulted in recommendations that support the use of an HPV test in the context of cervical cancer screening and management. Prophylactic HPV vaccine trials have demonstrated high efficacy, and an HPV vaccine that prevents cervical cancer precursors, cervical cancer, and anogenital warts caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 was licensed for use in girls and women aged 9-26 years by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2006.

CD008054,0,17024097,0,Cutaneous human papillomaviruses persist on healthy skin.,"Cutaneous human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are frequently found in healthy skin and have also been implicated in non-melanoma skin cancer. For genital HPV types, a persistent infection with one of the high-risk types is a prerequisite for the development of cervical cancer. However, there is only limited data on whether infections with cutaneous HPV types persist over time. Serial forehead swab samples collected from 63 volunteers (42 healthy individuals and 31 renal transplant recipients (RTRs)), sampled 6.3 years (range: 5.0-7.0 years) apart, were analyzed for HPV using general primer PCR, cloning, and sequencing. Among the healthy individuals, the prevalences of HPV were 69% (29/42) at enrolment and 71% (30/42) at follow-up. Among the individuals positive at baseline, 48% (14/29) had a persistent infection. Among the RTRs, 71% (15/21) were positive for HPV at enrolment and 90% (19/21) at follow-up. A persistent infection was detected in 33% (5/15). In total, HPV was detected in 44 of the samples collected at baseline and the same virus was found at follow-up in 43% (19/44). Persistence was not significantly associated with age, sex, immunosuppressive treatment, history of warts, or genus of HPV. We conclude that cutaneous HPV infections commonly persist over several years on healthy skin."

The commonest clinical presentation was post-coital bleeding (8), which was followed by vaginal bleeding (2) and leukorrhagia (4). Grossly, the lesions were either polypoid (8) or ulcerated (4). On histological examination, the lesions were eroded and involved the superficial mucosa 2-12 mm (mean 4 mm) in depth. They comprised sheets of dense populations of predominantly large lymphoid cells admixed with small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. Follicle formation was occasionally seen. Immunostaining revealed the majority of the large cells were B cells (CD20(+), CD79a(+)) with no aberrant CD5 and CD43 expression. The lymphoid cells in the follicle were CD10(+) and bcl6(+) but negative for bcl-2. Cyclin D1 was negative. There was no immunoglobulin light chain restriction and polymerase chain reaction for T cell receptor-gamma chain gene and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene demonstrated polyclonal patterns.

The optimal management of first-time atypia on routine Pap smear has not been established. In many clinics, colposcopically directed sampling of the cervix is recommended only if atypia persists following specific or nonspecific treatment of cervicitis or after an arbitrarily determined time interval. Others recommend immediate colposcopic evaluation. To determine the best approach to the first-time atypical Pap smear in young minority women at high risk for the development of cervical cancer, 250 such patients were evaluated with colposcopically directed biopsy of the cervix prior to any form of therapy. Pap smears were repeated at the time of colposcopy. Histologically, there was evidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in 41% of patients and human papillomavirus infection in 86%. Repeat Pap smears predicted the presence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in only 24% of patients. Immediate colposcopic evaluation represents the most prudent approach to the first-time atypical Pap smear in young, high-risk minority women."

We describe the state of the art of cancer control structures in the 27 European Union countries, plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, at the beginning of 2008. Information on cancer plans, cancer registries, cancer screening, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and smoking restrictions in each country was identified through PubMed, the official websites of national and international organizations and Google searches. Experts and/or health authorities from each country completed and validated the information. Sixteen countries had implemented national cancer plans in 2008. Twenty four countries had population-based cancer registries with 100% coverage. The exceptions were Greece and Luxembourg (no population-based registry yet), France, Italy and Spain (<50%), and Switzerland (62%). In 9 countries, population coverage of breast cancer screening was 100% with participation ranging from 26 to 87%; 8 countries did not have organized programmes. Seven countries had cervical cancer screening programmes with 100% coverage with participation ranging from 10 to 80%; 8 countries had no organized programme. Nine countries had announced national HPV vaccination policies by early 2008. Six countries had organized colorectal cancer screening programmes. Five countries had complete bans on smoking in public places. There is wide international heterogeneity in cancer control structures in Europe. This provides considerable scope and motivation for cooperation and sharing of experience."

CD008054,0,14566831,0,Condom use promotes regression of human papillomavirus-associated penile lesions in male sexual partners of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Penile HPV-associated lesions are frequently seen in male sexual partners of women with CIN. The natural course and clinical significance of these lesions are unclear. Women with CIN and their male sexual partners were randomized for condom use (condom group n = 68, noncondom group n = 68). Males were screened for the presence of penile lesions, i.e., flat lesions, papular lesions and condylomata acuminata, and of HPV in their penile swabs by PCR testing. Median follow-up time was 13.1 months (range 2.9-57.4). The outcome of our study was clinical regression of penile lesions defined as disappearance of lesions at penoscopy. Potentially prognostic factors, i.e., HPV status, lesion type and age, were studied as well. Outcomes were assessed in 57 men of the condom group and in 43 men of the noncondom group. Condom use shortened the median time to regression of flat penile lesions (7.4 months condom group vs. 13.9 months noncondom group; HR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.7). This effect was not found for papular lesions (HR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.1-2.8). HPV-negative men showed a significantly shorter median time to regression of flat lesions (3.8 months) compared to men with either HPV-positive status (8.5 months; HR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.9) or inconsistent HPV status (13.1 months; HR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.6). Regression of flat penile lesions is HPV-dependent and accelerated by condom use. This effect is probably the result of blocking viral transmission between sexual partners."
CD008054,0,8900368,0,Human papillomavirus genotype as a predictor of persistence and development of high-grade lesions in women with minor cervical abnormalities.,"Women referred for colposcopy with mild and moderate dyskaryosis and found to have only minor cervical abnormalities were screened for oncogenic human papilloma virus (HPV) types. The natural development of these abnormalities in 42 HPV-positive women was assessed by cytology and colposcopy at 6-month intervals for up to 2 years. As is the case with cancers and high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN), minor cervical abnormalities were frequently found to be associated with HPV16, -18, -31 and -33. Viral persistence and the development of high-grade lesions were found to be closely associated with HPV16; 56% of HPV16 isolates were persistent compared to 7% of other HPV types, and all 4 subsequent CIN 3 lesions were in women with persistent infection. A striking association of persistence with a variant of HPV16 having a base change at nucleotide 350 was observed. Ten of 12 women with this variant had persistent infection compared to only 1 of 16 women infected with the HPV16 prototype."
CD008054,0,14566832,0,Condom use promotes regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and clearance of human papillomavirus: a randomized clinical trial.,"Women with persistent HPV infections have increased risk of progressive CIN lesions. Transmission of HPV between sexual partners might maintain viral infection and, consequently, may influence the clinical course of CIN. We investigated the effect of condom use on regression of CIN lesions and on clearance of HPV. Women with CIN and their male sexual partners were randomized for condom use (condom group n = 72 and noncondom group n = 76). They were conservatively managed and followed every 3-6 months by colposcopy, cytology and HPV testing by GP5+/6+ PCR. Baseline cervical biopsy specimens were taken. Median follow-up time for women was 15.2 months (range 3.0-85.4). Outcomes of interest were clinical regression of CIN at colposcopy and clearance of HPV. Outcomes were assessed in 64 women of the condom group and 61 women of the noncondom group. Women in the condom group showed a 2-year cumulative regression rate of 53% vs. 35% in the noncondom group (p = 0.03). The 2-year cumulative rates of HPV clearance were 23% vs. 4%, respectively (p = 0.02). Although lower regression rates were found if women were HPV-positive and had > or =CIN2 lesions at baseline, effects of condom use were found both in women with CIN1 and in women with > or =CIN2 lesions. Condom use promotes regression of CIN lesions and clearance of HPV."
CD008054,0,17565745,0,Human papillomavirus triage of women with persistent borderline or mildly dyskaryotic smears: Comparison of costs and side effects of three alternative strategies.,"The conventional direct referral to colposcopy of persistent borderline or mildly dyskaryotic (BMD) smears in cervical cancer screening leads to considerable unnecessary referrals and associated anxiety and costs. This may be improved by including testing for oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) in the triage. We assessed costs and side effects (referrals, treatments and time in follow-up) for 3 possible HPV triage strategies (immediate HPV testing, a 6-month delay in HPV testing, a 2-stage combination of both) and compared them with the conventional strategy. The assessments are based on recent Dutch data from various national databases and trials. We estimated that the referral rate could be reduced by 49, 58 and 58% with immediate, delayed and 2-stage HPV testing, respectively. As a consequence, the average length of follow-up, as well as average costs, also decrease. Therefore, we advocate including HPV testing before referring to colposcopy. Among the 3 HPV strategies, analysis of additional aspects favors implementation of immediate HPV testing."
CD008054,0,9584897,0,DNA-cytometry of progressive and regressive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"A retrospective analysis was performed on archival cervical smears from a group of 56 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), who had received follow-up by cytology only. Automated image cytometry of Feulgen-stained DNA was used to determine the differences between progressive and regressive lesions. The first group of 30 smears was from women who had developed cancer after initial smears with dysplastic changes (progressive group). The second group of 26 smears with dysplastic changes had shown regression to normal (regressive group). The goal of the study was to determine if differences in cytometric features existed between the progressive and regressive groups. CIN categories I, II and III were represented in both groups, and measurements were pooled across diagnostic categories. Images of up to 700 intermediate cells were obtained from each slide, and cells were scanned exhaustively for the detection of diagnostic cells. Discriminant function analysis was performed for both intermediate and diagnostic cells. The most significant differences between the groups were found for diagnostic cells, with a cell classification accuracy of 82%. Intermediate cells could be classified with 60% accuracy. Cytometric features which afforded the best discrimination were characteristic of the chromatin organization in diagnostic cells (nuclear texture). Slide classification was performed by thresholding the number of cells which exhibited progression associated changes (PAC) in chromatin configuration, with an accuracy of 93 and 73% for diagnostic and intermediate cells, respectively. These results indicate that regardless of the extent of nuclear atypia as reflected in the CIN category, features of chromatin organization can potentially be used to predict the malignant or progressive potential of CIN lesions."

Paraffin-embedded samples containing at least 20% tumor were dewaxed, rehydrated, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed. Among 344 assessable samples, 136 (40%) were diploid and 208 (60%) were nondiploid (26 tetraploid, 158 aneuploid, and 24 polyploid). Diploid cases were further subclassified: 25 high proliferative phase (HPP) (S+G2M greater than 20%) and 111 low proliferative phase. No significant correlation was noted between DNA diploid patterns and stage, tumor size, grade, or histotype, but HPP diploid tumors had a significantly higher risk of nodal metastasis. With a mean follow-up period of 150 months, 62 patients died of disease. No significant difference was observed in survival rates (SR) between diploid and nondiploid tumors, but the subset of HPP diploid tumors had a prognosis significantly worse than that of any other group (P less than 0.01). Other significant variables included nodal metastases, parametrial extension, age, and clinical stage. While ploidy patterns did not assign additional risk to node-positive lesions, HPP diploid tumors in node-negative patients were associated with a significantly lower SR. Multivariate analyses in node-negative patients demonstrated that stage, histologic subtype, and HPP diploid patterns retained prognostic independence."

Follow-up information for all ASC cases encountered in Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China, from July 2000 to June 2004 (using TBS 1991 in the first 2-year period and TBS 2001 in the second) was analyzed. Among 4, 089 ASC cases studied, more than 50% had negative follow-up; this percentage was lower with TBS 2001. The percentage of ASC cases with a low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) end point was higher with TBS 2001, especially after application of LBC. There was also a decreasing trend of having this low-grade CIN end point with advancing age. Most clinically significant outcomes occurred after 6 months and before 1 year post-ASC diagnosis. With TBS 2001, more than 50% of ASC, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H) were associated with high-grade CIN on follow-up. TBS 2001 improves the positive predictive value of ASC for clinically significant lesions.

The aim of the study was to evaluate p16 ink4a and L1 as immunohistochemical markers of the biologic potentiality of low-grade dysplasia of the uterine cervix. The study included 38 conization specimens with coexisting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1) and 3 (CIN3) (group A) and 28 punch biopsies from women with CIN1 and proven spontaneous regression in the follow-up (group B). In group A, all CIN3 were p16 ink4a positive (p16+) and L1 negative (L1-). The CIN1 of this group were p16+L1- and p16+L1+ in 68.42% and 31.57%, respectively. No other expression pattern was found in this group. In group B, the p16+L1-, p16+L1+, p16-L1+, and p16-L1- patterns were found in 3.57%, 25%, 14.29%, and 57.14%, respectively. Overall, 96.29% p16+L1- CIN1 were found in group A, whereas all the p16-L1+ and p16-L1- CIN1 were found in group B. A significant difference between staining pattern distributions of group A and B was observed (P<0.0001). The results of the study show that p16 ink4a and L1 immunohistochemistry can be helpful for estimating the biologic potentiality of low-grade squamous cervical lesions. Particularly in cases in which the grade of the lesion is morphologically difficult to assess, the p16/L1 expression pattern could be useful for planning the clinical management of these women."

They are caused by low-risk human papillomavirus types, have no oncogenic potential and are not linked to cervical cancer. However, they often cause significant psychological morbidity. Treatments are aimed at eradicating the unsightly lesions and stimulating the immune system to generate clearance and prevent recurrence. Commonly used physical treatment methods include cryotherapy, trichloroacetic acid, laser, and electrocautery. However, many patients respond extremely well to home therapies with either podophyllotoxin or imiquimod. Patients prefer the comfort and dignity of home treatment, and this should be the first-line of treatment for the majority of patients. A routine screen for sexually transmitted infections is appropriate in most cases.

These Pap tests are often interpreted as ""LSIL/ASC-H"" or ""LSIL"" with a comment indicating the presence of cells with features approaching HSIL. Patients with LSIL/ASC-H have a significant risk of CIN 2 or worse (29-61.5%) on follow-up cervical biopsies, similar to the risk of CIN 2 or worse in patients with ASC-H Pap tests (24-68%). The purpose of this study was to compare patients with ASC-H and LSIL/ASC-H Pap tests. Women with LSIL/ASC-H had a slightly lower incidence of CIN 2 or worse (PPV = 35.6%, 95% CI: 29.8-41.4%) on follow-up cervical biopsy than the control ASC-H group (PPV = 40.2%, 95% CI: 31.9-56.3%); this difference was not statistically significant. The difference in the distribution of the biopsy results between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The current guidelines for the management of cervical cytologic abnormalities from the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) advocate similar treatment algorithms for both LSIL and ASC-H. The main difference is the option of cytologic follow-up or HPV testing for certain ""special populations,"" as an alternative to colposcopy, for LSIL Pap test results. Based on our results, we recommend (1)LSIL/ASC-H to be added to TBS classification and (2) Pap test cases of LSIL/ASC-H may need to be clinically followed in a manner similar to ASC-H, i.e., colposcopy for all patients."
CD008054,0,12076263,0,"Superficial collagenous fibroma: immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and flow cytometric study of three cases, including one pemphigus vulgaris patient with a dermal mass.","Collagenous fibroma (desmoplastic fibroblastoma) is an extremely rare benign soft tissue tumor of fibroblastic origin. The majority of reported cases have been located in the deep subcutis, fascia, aponeurosis, or skeletal muscle of the extremities, limb girdles, or head and neck regions. There has been no mention of underlying diseases in patients who developed this tumor. We here report an additional three cases of superficial collagenous fibroma, one of which was a dermal lesion occurring in the abdomen of a 26-year-old male patient with a 5-year history of pemphigus vulgaris prior to development of the tumor. To the best of our knowledge, an association between collagenous fibroma and pemphigus vulgaris has not previously been reported. The remaining two tumors were located in the superficial subcutaneous tissue of the infrascapular area and right foot, respectively. There was no tumor recurrence or metastasis during follow up of 18, 25, and 47 months, respectively. All three tumors were well-circumscribed and unencapsulated without infiltrating borders. Histologically, the common denominator of all three cases was paucicellular proliferation of spindle or stellate fibroblasts enmeshed within an extensively collagenous background. Immunohistochemically, there was diffuse strong staining for vimentin and intense focal reaction for smooth muscle actin in two tumors tested. Electron microscopy revealed features consistent with a fibroblastic or myofibroblastic lineage. Flow cytometry in two cases demonstrated a diploid DNA content with low S-phase fractions, which correlated with minimal MIB-1 nuclear labeling (less than 1%) and benign behavior of this entity."

CD008054,0,8381393,0,Molecular and serological studies of human papillomavirus among patients with anal epidermoid carcinoma.,"Certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are associated with anogenital carcinomas, including carcinomas of the anal canal. Whereas several serological studies have found an association between papillomavirus antibody responses and cervical carcinoma, the antibody response against papillomavirus antigens among patients with anal carcinoma has not been investigated. The present study has examined the antibody responses to a panel of papillomavirus-derived antigens and compared the serological profile with the histology and HPV carrier state of the tumor, as well as with the stage and prognosis of the disease. Sera from 64 patients with anal cancer and from 79 healthy blood donors were studied in ELISA for the presence of IgA and IgG antibodies to 5 previously described HPV16-derived synthetic peptide antigens. Serum IgA antibodies to a peptide antigen derived from the E2 region of HPV16 were found in 89% of patients with anal cancer as compared to 24% of controls (p = 0.0001). The IgA reactivity to the 4 other antigens showed only low and non-significant increases in mean titer. Serum IgG responses were similar among patients and controls. Among patients who had progressive disease, 21/21 were seropositive for IgA anti-E2 at diagnosis, as compared to 36/43 patients who were in remission after a mean follow-up of 41 months (p = 0.05). Forty-seven cases of anal carcinoma were also studied for the presence of HPV by in situ hybridization using a probe mix of 7 anogenital HPV types. Sixteen patients (35%) carried HPV in their anal cancer and one patient had an HPV-positive benign lesion adjacent to the tumor. Patients with HPV-carrying anal cancer were significantly younger than those with HPV-negative anal cancers (mean age: 57 and 68 years, respectively, p = 0.03). No differences in seroreactivity or HPV carrier state were seen depending on the stage or histological type of the tumor."

LEEPs were carried out in 32 women, three cold knife conizations, one vaginal hysterectomy and one Wertheim Meigs procedure. Results of 53.1% of LEEP surgical procedures did not have margin involvement by the lesions. Bleeding complications were seen in 15.6%. Regular follow-up with two or three cytologic and colposcopic tests in 32 women was carried out. All cases were negative for lesions. Five women were not followed-up due mainly to logistical reasons.

CD008054,0,19621855,0,Update on ASCCP consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical screening tests and cervical histology.,"New data have emerged since publication of the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology's 2001 consensus guidelines for management of abnormal cervical cytology and histology. The 2006 guidelines include recommendations for special populations (i.e., adolescents and pregnant women). Human papillomavirus testing is now included for management of atypical glandular cytology, for follow-up after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and in combination with cytologic screening in women 30 years and older. The preferred management of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance in adult women is reflex human papillomavirus DNA testing. Colposcopy is recommended for adult women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, atypical glandular cells, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 1 can be managed conservatively in adult women, but treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grades 2 and 3 is recommended. Immediate treatment is an option for adult women but not for adolescents with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Conservative management of adolescents with any cytologic or histologic diagnosis except specified cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 3 and adenocarcinoma in situ is recommended. Colposcopy is preferred for pregnant women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, but evaluation of the former may be deferred until no earlier than six weeks postpartum. Treatment during pregnancy is unacceptable unless invasive carcinoma is identified."

Biobehavioral and psychosocial research is uniquely capable of addressing many of the issues raised by HPV and its link with cervical cancer. In this article we review current findings in this area and identify issues for future research. The first of the three sections explores issues associated with the introduction of HPV testing for the detection and management of cervical abnormalities and the impact of growing public awareness of the sexually transmitted nature of cervical cancer. The implications for public understanding of cervical cancer, psychosocial issues associated with screening, and the potential impact on screening uptake are discussed. The second section addresses the role of biobehavioral factors in the persistence and progression of HPV infection as well as possible interventions to minimize the risk of persistence. Finally, primary prevention of HPV is discussed."
CD008054,0,16000445,0,Comparison between the Hybrid Capture II test and a PCR-based human papillomavirus detection method for diagnosis and posttreatment follow-up of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the major cause of cervical cancer and its precursor, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and HPV testing has therefore been proposed for improved triaging and follow-up of women treated for CIN. We compared two common HPV DNA detection tests (Hybrid Capture II [HCII] and PCR-enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) using the primers GP5+/GP6+ followed by HPV typing with reverse dot blot hybridization) for sensitivity and specificity for detection of CIN and of CIN recurrence after treatment. Two hundred and thirty-nine women referred to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in VÃ¤sterÃ¥s, Sweden, were enrolled because of atypical Pap smears; 177 of these were later treated for dysplasia by conization or loop diathermy. Samples for HPV DNA testing were taken before and 4 to 6 months after treatment. There was substantial agreement between the HCII and PCR-EIA (kappa, 0.70 before treatment and 0.72 after treatment). The sensitivity for histopathologically confirmed CIN III was 100.0% for PCR-EIA and 95.6% for HCII. For patients with CIN II or worse (CIN II+), the sensitivities were 92.9% (PCR-EIA) and 91.8% (HCII). The specificities for CIN II+ in the pretreatment setting were 30.4% for PCR-EIA and 24.1% for HCII. After treatment, the sensitivities for CIN III in cytology were 100.0% by both methods, and for CIN II+, sensitivities were 80.0% by both methods. The specificities for CIN II+ in the posttreatment setting were 83.5% for PCR and 85.4% for HCII. In conclusion, the sensitivities of both PCR-EIA and HCII are high and almost equal, suggesting that both methods are suitable as tools for detection and posttreatment follow-up of CIN II-III."

CD008054,0,17512722,0,The risk of developing cervical cancer in Mexican women is associated to CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the association of two CYP1A1 polymorphisms (Msp1 and exon 7) with cervical cancer in Mexican women considering their smoking habit. The polymorphisms were determined in 310 individuals (155 with cervical cancer and 155 healthy controls). Women with MspI T/C or C/C showed increased risk of developing cervical cancer (3.7- and 8.3-fold increase, respectively) compared to women with T/T genotype. When smoking habit was considered, the risk for non-smokers with T/C and C/C genotypes was similar (5.2 and 4.1, respectively), whereas smoking women with C/C genotype showed a 19.4-fold increase of cervical cancer. Number of child births, number of sexual partners and marital status were strong risk factors for developing cervical cancer in women with T/T genotype; however, in women with T/C genotype, only the number of child births and sexual partners had a significant influence. These results suggest an important role of the CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism in the risk of developing cervical cancer."

This article outlines how this surveillance is proposed to occur through the established national monitoring mechanisms of the National Cervical Screening Program in the annual Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) publication 'Cervical screening in Australia'. Cytological surveillance will be possible principally through cytology data provided annually by the state and territory cervical cytology registers, and it is expected that these data will provide the earliest and most comprehensive indications of effects from the HPV vaccine. Some potential issues in interpreting these data are also discussed, including the potentially confounding effects of the introduction of new National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines 'Screening to prevent cervical cancer: guidelines for the management of asymptomatic women with screen-detected abnormalities' some 9 months before the introduction of the vaccine. Cancer surveillance over the long term will be possible using cervical cancer incidence data reported annually for the National Cervical Screening Program in 'Cervical screening in Australia' using data sourced from the Australian Cancer Database. In a final discourse, the HPV vaccine and cervical screening are discussed concurrently, and the importance of continued cervical screening in the HPV vaccine era emphasised."

CD008054,0,8381707,0,Controversies in the management of low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"During the last 30 years, there have been major changes in the methods used to diagnose and manage cervical cancer precursors. Early detection of precursors through mass cytologic screening programs and the eradication of these precursors when detected are currently the cornerstone of policies aimed at reducing cervical cancer. These policies have been successful, resulting in a marked reduction in both the number of cases and deaths from cervical cancer in North America and Western Europe. Recently, however, significant controversy has arisen over several aspects of the diagnosis and management of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Two of the most important of these controversies are whether all patients with low-grade CIN lesions require therapy and what is the appropriate role for the newly introduced loop electrosurgical excision procedure in managing patients with CIN. In this article, these controversies are reviewed with emphasis placed on how these controversies affect the practicing gynecologist."

CD008054,0,18001182,0,Moving forward: human papillomavirus vaccination and the prevention of cervical cancer.,"In June 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The vaccine was subsequently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) for routine vaccination of 11-12-year-old girls and catch-up vaccination of females 13-26 years of age. With the approval of the first HPV vaccine, cervical cancer now has a primary prevention tool. However, the availability of an HPV vaccine will not change the course of cervical cancer in this country unless there is both widespread demand by and access for the targeted populations. Demand will require recognition of the need for protection against HPV infection as well as a positive perception of the vaccine as safe and efficacious. General knowledge of HPV and its relationship to cervical cancer is limited; some parents and healthcare providers are hesitant to vaccinate preadolescent girls. Access to the expensive vaccine will not be increased without addressing financial constraints. Although the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program has added HPV to its vaccine plan, not all private insurers have approved coverage, and the uninsured and underinsured may have limited access. Moving forward will require a well-planned and executed public information campaign by trusted sources and the development of a comprehensive vaccine administration program. Although mandates would assure the broadest coverage, controversies surrounding mandates may deter work toward broad coverage. States should focus on developing a comprehensive program and then return to the mandate issue if coverage does not meet public health objectives."
CD008054,0,19035312,0,Diallyl disulfide (DADS) induces apoptosis in human cervical cancer Ca Ski cells via reactive oxygen species and Ca2+-dependent mitochondria-dependent pathway.,"The mechanisms of apoptosis induced by diallyl disulfide (DADS) were explored in human cervical cancer Ca Ski cells. Flow cytometric analysis, DNA gel electrophoresis and DAPI staining demonstrated that DADS induced apoptosis in Ca Ski cells. DADS induced apoptosis through the production of reactive oxygen species and Ca2+, and induced abrogation of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) and cleavage of Bid protein (t-Bid). DADS increased the levels of p53, p21 and Bax, but caused a decrease in the level of Bcl-2. DADS also promoted the activities of caspase-3 leading to DNA fragmentation, thus indicating that DADS-induced apoptosis is caspase-3 dependent. In addition, DADS induced an increase in the level of cytochrome c in the cytoplasm, which was released from mitochondria. BAPTA attenuated the Deltapsim abrogation and significantly diminished the occurrence of DADS-induced apoptosis in Ca Ski cells. In conclusion, DADS-induced apoptosis occurs via production of ROS and caspase-3 and a mitochondria-dependent pathway in Ca Ski cells."

CD008054,0,8989775,0,Tissue effects and host response. The key to the rational triage of cervical neoplasia.,"Genital HPV infections are associated with a spectrum of lesions ranging from benign condylomata to invasive cancer and its precursor lesions. The transformation zone of the cervix is the most frequent target of the high-risk HPV types. Depending on the nomenclature used, cancer precursors are subdivided on the basis of their morphologic presentation into dysplasias (mild, moderate, and severe); cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN I, II, and III); or low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSILs and HGSILs). The HGSILs (i.e., moderate and severe dysplasias, CIN II and III lesions) are recognized universally as cancer precursors. The LGSILs (i.e., very mild dysplasia and mild dysplasias, condylomata and CIN I lesions), have shown that one of the most important denominators of their cancer potential is the presence of intermediate and particularly high-risk HPV types. HPV typing provides the most rational basis for selecting women with LGSILs to be colposcoped and treated or given follow-up treatment with Pap smears. Until the clinical significance of HPV typing is known, management decisions may be based on an individual's risk factors such as age, compliance, past history of abnormal Pap smears, sexual habits, and access to adequate cytologic diagnosis."
CD008054,0,16925896,0,"Enrolment of 22,000 adolescent women to cancer registry follow-up for long-term human papillomavirus vaccine efficacy: guarding against guessing.","Human papillomaviruses (HPVs, most notably types 16 and 18) cause cervical carcinoma, the second most common cancer among women. Vaccination of adolescents against HPV16/18 might prevent large proportion of cervical and other anogenital cancers. However, because of ethical reasons this cannot be proven by clinical studies. To determine the long-term vaccine efficacy (VE) of HPV16/18 virus-like-particle (VLP) vaccine against cervical carcinoma in situ (CIS+) and invasive cervical carcinoma, the following three population-based cohorts of adolescent women have been enrolled: (1) women vaccinated with the HPV vaccine; (2) women vaccinated with hepatitis A control vaccine; and (3) unvaccinated control women. These cohorts will be passively followed for cumulative incidence of CIS+ endpoints by population-based cancer registry. Overall 24,046 16- to 17-year-old adolescent women from 18 cities in Finland were invited between May 2004 and June 2005 to participate in a phase III trial with bivalent HPV16/18 VLP vaccine. A total of 58,996 18- to 19-year-old women were invited in May 2005 to participate as unvaccinated controls. Women who reported their willingness to participate in an HPV vaccination trial had they been 1-2 years younger were eligible. Cumulative incidence (CI) of CIS+ in our cohorts over 15 years is approximately 0.45%. VE of 70% against CIS+ with 80% power requires 3357-3189 HPV16/18 vaccine recipients, 3357-3189 other vaccine recipients, and 6714-9567 unvaccinated controls. We have now enrolled 2404 HPV16/18 vaccine recipients, 2404 hepatitis A-vaccine recipients, and 5130 unvaccinated controls. This enrolment in addition to our earlier enrolment in another phase III trial guarantees enough power so that by 2020 we can ultimately provide data on the efficacy of HPV16/18 vaccination against CIS+."
CD008054,0,12067805,0,Telomerase inhibition and the future management of head-and-neck cancer.,"Telomeres are tandem repeats of DNA associated with specific proteins. These structures cap eukaryotic chromosomes and maintain the integrity of the chromosome ends. In the germline, telomeres are maintained by the enzyme telomerase, but in normal somatic cells the enzyme's activity is low or undetectable. Human tumours, including squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), need telomerase to maintain telomere function; inhibition of the enzyme can lead to apoptosis. Furthermore, because most tumour cells have very short telomeres, they are more likely to succumb to telomerase inhibition than normal cells. Telomerase is therefore a potential selective anticancer target. The telomere is also involved in the repair of DNA double strand breaks, and telomere dysfunction provokes radiosensitivity. In this review we consider whether manipulation of telomere function may selectively sensitise SCCHN to radiotherapy and discuss the possible pitfalls. We also assess how some conventional treatments may affect the subsequent use of telomerase inhibitors."
CD008054,0,18297710,0,Human papillomavirus and mutated H-ras oncogene in cervical carcinomas and pathological negative pelvic lymph nodes: a retrospective follow-up.,"The metastasis status of pelvic lymph nodes (PLNs) seems to be a predictive factor of survival. It was suggested that the presence of HPV DNA and other biological markers in PLN may indicate a sub clinical early metastasis. The aim was to describe the prevalence and distribution patterns of HPV DNA and H-ras mutations in intra operatively obtained cervical tumors and PLN. Thirty-seven cervical tumors and 61 lymph node biopsies from 37 patients with cervical cancer were selected. HPV typing and location were performed by PCR/dot blot and in situ hybridization (ISH) respectively. PCR/RFLP was used to scan for mutations in H-ras. Hundred percent of the cervical cancers and 85% of the PLN were HPV positive; co-infection with more than one type was 27%. HPV 16 was detected alone or co-infecting with other types in 84% of tumors and 46% of PLN; the second most frequent viral type was HPV 18 (tumor: 27%; PLN: 20%). In PLN, HPV was located in nuclei or/and cytoplasm of lymphocytes, macrophages, endothelial, and /or stromal cells. H-ras mutations were identified in 5/24 (21%) of patients with cervical tumors showing poor or moderated differentiation. HPV DNA in histological tumor-free PLN not necessary indicate metastasis, but it may be associated to an active immune reaction. Mutated H-ras is probably involved in cervical carcinogenesis and its detection in tumor and metastasis free PLN may be related to early metastasis or recurrence in at least a subset of poorly differentiated cervical tumors."
CD008054,0,16925893,0,The recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in HIV-positive women: a review of the literature.,"The objective of this study was to assess the available evidence on the outcome of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in HIV-positive women after conization. We performed a literature search of Medline and Cochrane libraries to locate published articles reporting about the rate of recurrence of CIN after excisional treatment in patients with negative surgical margins. Out of 15 articles, five studies reported recurrence rate of CIN in margin negative patients. The recurrence rate of CIN after conization in HIV-infected women ranges from 20% to 75%. No conclusions can be drawn about the impact of CD4 cell counts on the recurrence rate. Available evidence suggests that standard excisional treatments for CIN are associated with high rates of recurrence in HIV-positive women. Despite the fact that the evidence is limited because of the few number of eligible studies, this issue should be considered in the management of HIV-positive patient with CIN."
CD008054,0,11604553,0,Adaptive intrapatient dose escalation of cisplatin in patients with advanced head and neck cancer.,"The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility and toxicity of intrapatient dose adjustment using predefined levels of exposure to cisplatin, with the ultimate goal to further improve the antitumor activity of the treatment. The primary parameter for adaptive dosing was the level of platinum DNA adducts in peripheral white blood cells (WBC) and the secondary parameter the area under the curve (AUC) of unbound platinum in plasma, which were determined during the applied courses. Target levels had been defined in a previously performed pharmacologic study. The concept of adaptive dosing was tested in 16 patients with locally advanced head and neck (H/N) cancer who would receive six weekly courses of cisplatin at a starting dose level of 80 mg/m(2), which was previously investigated in a phase II study. Forty-seven percent of patients received a dose increase varying from 10 to 40%. Only two patients had exposure levels significantly below the defined target levels for DNA adducts and AUC. The majority of patients reached the defined target levels by modest dose increases of 10-20% during course 2. Relevant but reversible ototoxicity (temporary grade 3 in two patients) and renal toxicity (temporary grade 2 in two other patients) were observed. The pattern and severity of the toxicity was comparable to that encountered in the previous phase II study in H/N cancer patients. We conclude that the strategy of intrapatient dose adjustment for cisplatin is practically feasible in a research setting even when a short turn around time of 1 week is the limit for reporting results. Although in some patients the dose increase that had to be applied to reach target levels was substantial (up to 40%), this approach in H/N cancer patients is not expected to improve the response rate significantly, because these significantly underdosed patients represented only a small percentage of the investigated population.

The outlined concept is currently being explored in other tumor types and schedules of cisplatin."
CD008054,0,16142133,0,[Contribution of viral typing in cytological anomalies of the cervix].,"Management practices for low-grade cervical lesions identified on screening swabs have been modified by research on the HPV. The appropriate approach for low-grade lesions is particularly difficult to determine due to the potential risk of malignant transformation coupled with the cost implications of treating lesions which will heal spontaneously in the majority of patients. The diagnosis of these low-grade lesions can be improved by thin layer swabs which have a greater sensitivity than conventional swabs. The current consensus is that swab results should be expressed according to the Bethesda classification. Routine tests for HPV (Hybrid Capture II) should be reserved for patients with an ASC-US swab. Colposcopy is indicated if the swab is positive for a low-grade lesion followed by cytology if the colposcopy is normal. If there is no evidence of HPV, search for oncogenes can lighten the treatment regimen due to the high specificity of the test. If a low-grade histological lesion (CIN1) is proven, cytocolposcopic surveillance should be proposed, surgical resection being undertaken in colposcopy cannot be performed. Here again search for HPV oncogenes at one year is an interesting alternative if the examination is negative. These practices are applicable in adolescents and HIV- positive patients who are particularly exposed to HPV."
CD008054,0,11285038,0,Extensive subcutaneous metastases from squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix in patient with HIV.,"Advanced human immunodeficiency viral disease is associated with a high prevalence of cervical squamous intraepithelial and invasive lesions and probably with a rapidly progressive course of disease. Metastases to the skin occur rarely in cervical cancer, even in terminal stage of the disease. A patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 14 years was diagnosed with squamous cell cancer of the cervix, Stage I-B2 in June 1997. She underwent successful radiotherapy. She then presented in January 1999 with recurrence evidenced by extensive subcutaneous nodules and multiple metastases. The patient developed rapidly progressive disease and died within two months. Patients with HIV and cervical cancer may present with a more aggressive course of disease. Aggressive treatment and closer follow-up may be indicated."
CD008054,0,11285032,0,The presence of HPV DNA in cervical cancer: correlation with clinico-pathologic parameters and prognostic significance: 10 years experience at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Mainz University.,"The objective of this study was to assess whether the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA and/or several genotypes of HPV DNA in cervical cancer are correlated with several clinicopathologic parameters of well-defined prognostic significance and whether virologic parameters are predictors of long-term survival in cancer patients. Two hundred twenty three cases of cervical cancer patients included in this retrospective study underwent follow-up evaluation. Survival and cause of death were examined for 204 (91.4%) patients, with a mean follow-up time of 4.4 years. HPV DNA was detected using the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method followed by HPV DNA sequencing for HPV genotyping. These results were correlated with well-defined clinicopathologic parameters and survival data. HPV DNA was detected by PCR in 150 of 193 (73.4%) tissue specimens of cervical cancer patients. DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of HPV 16 (n = 68, 45.3%), HPV 18 (n = 49, 32.6%) and rare HPV types (n = 33, 22.1%). HPV genotypes correlated significantly with histologic tumor types, node status, tumor oxygenation, blood vessel invasion, and lymph space involvement. The presence of HPV DNA in cervical cancer as well as the genotype of HPV 16 could also be confirmed as significant prognostic factors in the univariate Cox regression analysis (RR 2.856, P < 0.003 resp. RR 3.444, P < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, however, HPV DNA status failed to be of prognostic relevance. Exclusively HPV 16 appears to have an independent impact on the overall survival in cervical patients (RR 3.653, P < 0.002). We conclude that the detection of HPV 16 genotype may play an important adjunct role in assessing prognosis of cervical cancer patients. The clinical impact of the presence of HPV DNA in primary tumors of uterine cervix remains to be investigated in further studies, and the exact mechanisms by which HPV influences the prognosis of cervical cancer patients have to be defined."
CD008054,0,11361951,0,Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia in women with HIV.,"The increasing incidence of lower genital tract neoplasia in HIV-infected women and the inherent difficulties in diagnosis and treatment have undermined effective management and contributed significantly to the morbidity of this population. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has included high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, as well as cervical carcinoma in situ, as part of the classification of HIV, with invasive cervical cancer as an AIDS-defining condition. The incidence of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) nearly doubled between 1973 and 1987. In one study, VIN has been reported to occur 29 times more frequently in HIV-infected women than in a control group of self-identified non-HIV-infected women. Because women with HIV are now living longer, they face an increased possibility of the development of these infections along with the long-term sequelae and the risk of transformation to cancer. Treatment of VIN is guided by the size and location of the lesion, the grade of the dysplasia, and identification of coexisting disease in other sites. The case study presented exemplifies many of the management and education issues encountered following women with HIV disease and lower genital tract neoplasia, one of the most difficult issues being that the best mode of treatment for VIN has yet to be determined. Screening of the entire lower genital tract, including the vulva for dysplasia, is recommended for early detection and timely initiation of management."

CD008054,0,11400145,0,DNA image cytometry and human papillomavirus (HPV) detection help to select smears at high risk of high-grade cervical lesions.,"Three samples were submitted from women undergoing routine screening (n=910): two smears (one for routine cytology and one for DNA image cytometry) and a scrape for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. DNA histograms were classified as suspect in cases of aneuploidy, polyploidy, and/or diploidy with a high proliferation rate. Follow-up was available in 239 cases. The primary end-point was the presence of a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) at biopsy. Seventy women (7.7%) had a high-risk (HR) HPV infection and a suspect DNA profile. In 77 women with cytological abnormalities, 28 HGSILs were detected: four with a prior diagnosis of ASCUS (all HR-HPV infected including three with a suspect DNA profile), three with smears evocative of LGSIL (all with HR-HPV infection and a suspect DNA profile), and 21 with smears evocative of HGSIL (all with HR-HPV infection and 20 with a suspect DNA profile). During the follow-up period, out of 239 women with a cytologically normal smear at first entry, five developed a HGSIL; all were HR-HPV-positive and four had a suspect DNA profile at the first smear. HR-HPV detection alone gives a sensitivity of 100% for the detection of HGSIL, with a specificity of 84.3%, whereas DNA measurement associated with HPV testing significantly enhances the specificity to 95.4%. Thus, the combination of HPV testing and DNA measurement provides a highly sensitive and specific evaluation of the risk of HGSIL on cervical smears."

CD008054,0,1348800,0,Human papillomavirus type 16 in cervical smears as predictor of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [corrected].,"The management of women with mild to moderately dyskaryotic cervical smears would benefit from a non-invasive test that predicts which women have high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Detection of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) DNA in cervical smears may be such a test. With the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we estimated the amount of HPV16 DNA in cervical smears from 85 women referred for colposcopy because of abnormal cytology. An intermediate or high amount of HPV16 DNA predicted the presence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in a subsequent biopsy in almost 90% of patients irrespective of the cytological grade of the referral smear. This technique may allow early identification of those women with low-grade cytological abnormalities who have high-grade underlying cervical disease."
CD008054,0,9218897,0,Degree of dysplasia following diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance is influenced by patient history and type of follow-up.,"Previous studies have shown that atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) are a predictor of higher grade lesions when patients are followed up by biopsy. The purpose of this study was to examine follow-up on all patients with ASCUS to determine if the prediction of higher grade lesions seen in association with ASCUS is a function of bias in selection of patients for biopsy. The diagnosis of ASCUS, based on Bethesda System criteria, was made on 235 cases between June 1993 and December 1994 (2% of the total cases at Yale-New Haven clinics). Of these cases, 36 were biopsied and 94 were followed by cervical/vaginal smears (CVS). As has been seen in other retrospective studies, we found that 55% (20 of 36) biopsied after ASCUS on CVS showed condyloma or dysplasia. In cases with CVS follow-up instead of biopsy, only 26% (25 of 94) had significant lesions. We find that if ASCUS is evaluated by biopsy, the prediction for higher grade lesions is roughly twice that predicted by follow-up CVS. We purpose that nonstandardized management by gynecologists results, in many instances, in selection of patients with significant past history for biopsy. Consequently, the current literature finding of ASCUS as predictor of higher grade lesions should be reanalyzed, taking into account other parameters (past history, age, etc.) in the process of defining the clinical and biological implications of the ASCUS diagnosis."
CD008054,0,1326471,0,Human papillomavirus types and cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions that recur after cold-knife conization.,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the HPV types and histological margins of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) treated by cold-knife conization and to correlate this with recurrent disease. Of 203 cone biopsies done for SILs primarily because the entire lesion could not be visualized at colposcopy, follow-up information was available for 85 cases. Of these 85 cases, biopsy-proven recurrences were documented for 10 (12%) women. In the SILs which recurred after conization, the lesion was noted on the surgical margin in 7/10 (70%) cases. In contrast, SILs that did not recur after cold-knife conization were detected on the surgical margin in only 12% of cases. In 7 of the recurrences, the HPV type detected in the pretreatment SIL was the same as that detected in the SIL that occurred after conization. In the other 3 recurrences, one of either the primary or recurrent SILs was HPV positive and the other corresponding lesion HPV negative. It is concluded that detection of a SIL on the surgical margin is a marker for recurrent disease and that recurrences are often associated with the same HPV type as that noted in the pretreatment SIL."

Whenever stridor occurs in the first months of life, or when it is severe or chronic, or when stridor also persists throughout expiration, an underlying anatomic anomaly frequently exists. The following steps are important to the diagnostic management: besides a detailed and complete history and physical examination, an X-ray of the airways and, if necessary, laryngo/bronchoscopy, angio(cardio)graphy or computerized tomography of the chest and the cervical region. Subsequently, appropriate therapeutic management can be initiated by proficient and accomplished physicians."

Only 10% of first borderline smears are associated with a histological high-grade (HG) abnormality, i.e. CIN 2,3, invasive malignancy or glandular neoplasia on subsequent investigation. The advantages of highlighting this subgroup are obvious but is this possible? From 1996 and 1997, 242 borderline smears with histological follow-up were examined by two independent experienced observers (observer 1 and 2) without prior knowledge of further investigation results. For each smear a profile of nuclear details was produced, also noting the type of cell mainly affected by the process; then the observers were asked to assess the degree of worry of HG disease for each smear i.e. whether the smear fell into group 1 borderline changes indicative of low-grade (normal, inflammatory, CIN1/HPV) disease (BL/LG) or group 2 difficult borderline smear, HG disease (CIN 2,3, invasive neoplasia or glandular neoplasia) cannot be excluded (BL/HG). Observer 1 selected a group of BL/HG with a PPV for HG disease of 38%, with observer 2 having a PPV of 50%; this compared with the overall laboratory HG disease PPV for borderline smears of 14%. Both observers found the most useful criterion to be the increase in nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio. Our results show that it is possible to separate a small group of borderline smears which should be classified as 'borderline/high grade lesion difficult to exclude' (BL/HG). Both observers had some success in arriving at this classification although their method of selecting out this group was quite different."
CD008054,0,19588497,0,Age distribution of human papillomavirus infection and cervical neoplasia reflects caveats of cervical screening policies.,"Although a second age-related peak of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is observed in many populations, it does not seem to have any impact on cervical screening policies. We examined the age-specific prevalence of HPV infection among 2,604 women enrolled for cervical screening and correlated the age at diagnosis of 2,491 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2/3 (CIN2/3) lesions and 801 invasive cervical cancers (ICC). Two peaks of HPV infection were detected at 26-30 and 46-50 years, respectively. The first infection peak was followed by a CIN2/3 peak and an ICC peak at 5-15 and 15 years later, respectively. The second infection peak was followed by an ICC peak 20 years later, but strikingly no CIN2/3 peak was detected in between and thus eliminated an opportunity of treating the lesions at preinvasive stages. The most plausible explanation is that women at the expected second CIN2/3 peak (50-65 years) are not having Pap smears under the current opportunistic screening program. Furthermore, women of this age may have physiological retraction of the transformation zone, and CIN lesions may remain undetected if an adequate Pap smear sample is not obtained. To combat this problem, the screening program in Hong Kong needs to focus on women aged 50 years and older and a mop-up screening up to 75 years is necessary. Bimodal peaks of HPV infection and cervical cancer are seen in many countries and the analysis of population-specific age distribution of CIN2/3 should be an integral exercise in evaluating the effectiveness of a screening program."
CD008054,0,9748148,0,Combination E2F-1 and p53 gene transfer does not enhance growth inhibition in human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.,"Ample data exist contending that wild-type p53 and E2F-1 cooperate to mediate apoptosis, that E2F-1-mediated apoptosis is p53 dependent in some situations, and that E2F-1 can induce accumulation of p53 in mammalian cells. These data support the investigation of the biological consequences of combined wild-typep53 and E2F-1 overexpression in human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) for the purpose of developing apoptosis-inducing molecular intervention strategies for the management of this devastating disease. The recombinant adenovirus (Ad) vectors Ad-p53 and Ad-E2F-1 were used for wild-type p53 and E2F-1 gene transfers, respectively, into SCCHN cell lines TU138 and TU167. SCCHN cells transduced with either p53, E2F-1, or both underwent in vitro growth analysis, which revealed that simultaneous p53 and E2F-1 gene transfer did not result in enhanced growth inhibition. To explain our growth assay findings on the basis of potential negative molecular interactions between E2F-1 and p53, Western and Northern blotting analyses were performed to investigate the differential expression of the downstream p53-transactivated genes, p21Waf1 and BAX, under various p53 and E2F-1 gene transfer conditions. Whereas Western immunoblotting demonstrated that E2F-1 antagonized p53 induction of p21Waf1 and BAX, Northern blotting revealed that this interference was pretranslationally regulated and p53 dependent. Coimmunoprecipitation assay confirmed that the wild-type p53 and E2F-1 gene products formed protein-protein complexes in our cell lines. Our in vitro data demonstrated that in SCCHN, E2F-1 interferes with induction of p53-transactivated genes, probably through the formation of protein-protein complexes. Simultaneous p53 and E2F-1 gene transfer is not therapeutically advantageous in this in vitro model of SCCHN."
CD008054,0,12873166,0,Findings to date from the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS).,"Controversy exists in the United States regarding the proper evaluation and management of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and equivocal (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS, now ASC-US]) cervical cytologic interpretations. To address this issue, the National Cancer Institute initiated the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS). ALTS is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate 3 alternative methods of management, namely, immediate colposcopy, cytologic follow-up, and triage by human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing. This article summarizes the major findings of ALTS that have been published to date. Patients with ASCUS (n = 3488) or LSIL (n = 1572) were randomly assigned to research arms between November 1996 and December 1998, and were monitored for 2 years. The disease outcome was histologic cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3/cancer. The prevalence of oncogenic HPV was too high to permit effective triage of LSIL using HPV DNA testing by Hybrid Capture 2. However, for the women referred with a cytologic interpretation of ASCUS, HPV triage proved useful, with sensitivity equivalent to immediate colposcopy and a halving of colposcopic referrals. Among older women with ASCUS, HPV testing remained sensitive for detecting CIN 3 and cancer, but the referral percentage was dramatically lower compared to younger women. ALTS yielded insight into the performance of cytology and histopathology; experienced pathologists differed significantly in their interpretations of cervical abnormalities, especially histologic CIN 1 and cytologic ASCUS. Nonetheless, it was possible to distinguish a relatively uncommon type of ASCUS, equivocal for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, that has a high positive predictive value for identifying women with underlying high-grade CIN. Many additional analyses are underway."

However, the presence of HPV infection alone is not enough to cause tumorigenesis, suggesting a role for additional host-cell genetic factors. The aim of the present work was to study the association of K-ras and c-erbB-2 mutations in cervical tissue samples with different grades of dysplasia and infected with HPV-6 (""low-risk"" type) or HPV-16 and HPV-18 (""high-risk"" types). Negative HPV-DNA samples were used as controls. The detection of K-ras and c-erbB-2 activation were performed by Artificial Refractory Mutation System (ARMS)-PCR and semiquantitative PCR, respectively. Statistical analysis showed a highly significant difference in K-ras codon 12 mutation frequency between high-risk and low-risk HPV-infected samples (p<0.05). On the other hand, amplification of the c-erbB-2 oncogene appeared associated to tissue samples infected with HPV-6 (p<0.003). Cervical carcinoma appears to arise from a series of well-characterized progressive histological changes, but the genetic alterations necessary for cervical tumorigenesis are not yet clear. These results raise the possibility for a role of certain proto-oncogenes and their activation in cervical neoplasia."
CD008054,0,19901431,0,Infection of human papillomaviruses in cancers of different human organ sites.,"Clinico-epidemiological and molecular studies have established the casual link between Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer as also association of HPV infection with several other cancers. In India, cervical cancer is a leading cancer among women and almost all cases of cervical cancer show prevalence of High Risk (HR)-HPV infection. HPV has been also detected in a significant proportion of oral, esophageal, anal, vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancer and in a small percentage of lung, laryngeal, and stomach cancer in India. Due to lack of organized HPV screening program, insufficient infrastructure and trained manpower and inadequacy in cancer registries, there are not much data available on the countrywide HPV prevalence and its type distribution in different cancers in India. Forthcoming introduction of recently developed HPV vaccines in India given a new urgency to know the prevalence and distribution of various HPV types in different organ sites for the management and monitoring of vaccination program and its impact on prevalence of other cancers.

CD008054,0,19901435,0,The clinical utility of HPV DNA testing in cervical cancer screening strategies.,"Cervical cancer continues to be the commonest cause of death among women in developing countries, largely due to the failure to the inability to sustain effective cytology-based screening programs. While this burden may come down following implementation of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, screening will still be required. HPV DNA testing is a promising new technology for cervical cancer prevention and is the most reproducible of all cervical cancer screening tests. Presently, the two assays most widely used for the detection of genital types are the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Hybrid Capture 2 assays (hc2). Rapid, affordable tests are expected to be available soon. HPV DNA testing can be used in a variety of clinical scenarios that include primary screening in women older than 30 yr; as an adjunctive test to cytology; in the triage of women with an equivocal cytologic report, e.g., ASC-US; or for follow-up post-treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). HPV DNA testing can also be performed on self-collected samples, which allows screening in remote areas and also in women who refuse gynecologic examination."
CD008054,0,20204296,0,Persistence of HPV after radio-chemotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer.,"A causal association of high risk HPV persistent infections with cervical cancer is firmly established by epidemiological and experimental evidence. Since HPV is considered a necessary factor for cervix carcinoma development and disease severity, the HPV DNA persistence may represent an indicator of both therapy effectiveness and risk of recurrence. The presence of HPV in locally advanced cervical carcinoma was analysed at the beginning of therapy, shortly after treatment and during follow-up, in 18 patients with cervix carcinoma treated by radio/chemotherapy. Persistence of HPV DNA sequences was revealed in 62.5% (10/16) of HPV positive patients, in which the HPV type and its physical status were exactly the same as at the onset of therapy, even many years after surgery. Interestingly, in two patients the HPV18 sequence analysis detected the same point mutations in the samples before and after the chemotherapy, and during the follow-up. HPV DNA clearance was associated with a better patient outcome because the majority of the HPV cleared women showed a complete response (6/6), no disease recurrence (4/6), and are still alive. Nevertheless, statistically significant association was seen only with complete responses versus partial or no responses. In conclusion, we demonstrated that HPV DNA positive tumour cells might persist for years in the genital epithelia, even after the surgical removal of the cervix and that HPV DNA detection after therapy is a valid and significant (p=0.03) tool to assess the efficacy of the treatment."

CD008054,0,20222338,0,AIDS-related malignancies: revisited.,"Since the first reports between the association of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and neoplasia, there has been a dramatic change in the incidence and epidemiology of AIDS-related malignancies. Kaposi sarcoma (KS), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), and cervical cancer are classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as AIDS-defining malignancies. However, since the availability of highly active combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), especially protease inhibitors, there has been a steady increase in non- AIDS defining malignancies, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), lung cancer, hepatocellular cancer, anal cancer and others and a decline in AIDS-defining neoplasias. Although the emergence of non-AIDS defining cancers could be a result of longer life expectancy and due to a better control of HIV, toxic habits and co-infection with other viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papilloma virus (HPV) could play an important role. The interactions of cART and incomplete immune reconstitution could be other factors explaining the increase in non-AIDS defining cancers. These emerging non-AIDS defining malignancies present a new challenge in the care of patients with HIV infection, and require optimal treatment protocols that take into consideration the interaction between cART and systemic chemotherapy. We review the current status of AIDS-related malignancies, its pathophysiology, epidemiology and management with emphasis in the changing patterns of presentation."
CD008054,0,15110887,0,Detection of cervical precancer and cancer in a hospital population; benefits of testing for human papillomavirus.,"The aim was to determine the relevance of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in identifying high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse (CIN2/3+) in a hospital population (n=3574) characterised by a high rate of cytological abnormalities and high-risk HPV infections. According to the results of the initial Papanicolaou and HPV test, women were directly referred for colposcopy/biopsy or recalled for a control visit. Sensitivity and specificity were corrected for verification bias. HPV-testing sensitivity was 94.3%, higher than that of cytological testing at any cut-off point (65.1%-86.8%), while specificity was greater for cytology than for HPV testing (99.3% or 91.8% versus 83.4%). The combination of both tests allowed 100% sensitivity and negative predictive value. We conclude that HPV testing is a relevant tool for the detection of cervical disease. The best way of combining cytology and HPV detection in screening programmes should be evaluated in large-scale studies."

The materials we analyzed were 80 biopsied specimens obtained from 22 cases of dysplasia which were followed-up for a long time at our out-patient clinic, and 47 specimens of squamous cell carcinoma. Detection of HPV DNA was done by in situ hybridization with biotinylated HPV DNA probes types 6/11, 16/18 and 31/33/35. The analysis of several specimens obtained at long term follow-up showed that the dysplasia-progression group had a higher incidence and more frequent detection of HPV DNA than the regression group. In the progression group, HPV 16/18 were detected more frequently than HPV 31/33/35 at the dysplasia lesion, but HPV 6/11 was detected in neither the dysplasia nor the squamous cell carcinoma. Fourteen of the 47 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (29.8%) were positive for HPV DNA, and 13 of them (92.9%) were detected in the lesions of dysplasia adjacent to carcinoma in situ or invasive cancer. Comparison of the detection rate for HPV DNA was done in the 3 dysplastic areas, i.e. the dysplastic areas in the dysplasia progression group (A), dysplasia regression group (B) and in the area adjacent to squamous cell carcinoma (C). The detection rates for HPV DNA were 43.5% in A, 27.7% in C and 15.0% in B.

CD008054,0,19263042,1,Multiplex chemiluminescence microscope imaging of P16(INK4A) and HPV DNA as biomarker of cervical neoplasia.,"Classification of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions in low-grade (CIN1) or high-grade (CIN2-3) ones is crucial for optimal patient management, but current histological diagnosis on bioptic samples is often hampered by inter-observer variability. To allow objective classification, we have exploited the peculiar characteristics of chemiluminescence detection, such as high sensitivity and easy quantification of the luminescence signal, to perform sequentially in the same tissue section both an immunohistochemical quantitative detection of p16(INK4A) (a protein marker of high-grade CIN lesions) and an in situ hybridization for human papillomavirus (generally accepted as a necessary but insufficient cause of cervical carcinoma). Different label enzymes (alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase) were employed in order to avoid any interference between the two assays, and quantitative chemiluminescence image analysis was used to obtain objective evaluation of sample positivity. The multiplexed method allowed detection of two complementary biomarkers and provided discrimination between different lesions (non-neoplastic, low-grade and high-grade CIN). This assay might thus represent an accurate and objective diagnostic test providing important information for counseling, selection of therapy and follow up after surgical treatment."
CD008054,0,8191435,0,[Mass screening for cervical cancer. A one-year registration of cervical cytological tests].,"In 1990 the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Social Affairs decided to start an organised screening programme for cervical cancer. All women aged 25-70 years will be offered screening every three years. During the first three years of the programme, all spontaneous screening in Norway is to be reported to a central unit located at the Cancer Registry of Norway. A pilot project has been implemented in the counties of SÃ¸r-TrÃ¸ndelag and Vestfold to evaluate the organisational aspects of the screening programme. A total of 509,641 smears were recorded during the first year of recording. The majority of smears were taken from women below 50 years. Most smears (88.6%) had normal tissue morphology, while 2.9% displayed various cellular changes. Smears from younger women showed the highest rate of Human papillomavirus (HPV) changes and mild (CIN 1) and moderate (CIN 2) dysplasias, whereas the rated malignant cellular changes was highest in the older age groups. The findings support the wide age range of the target group."

One hundred and fifty women diagnosed with ACIS and 651 randomly selected control women completed in-person interviews. The presence of HPV DNA in archival ACIS specimens was determined by E6 and L1 consensus PCR. Serum samples from case and control subjects were collected at interview, and antibodies to HPV-16 L1 and HPV-18 L1 were detected by virus-like particle capture assays. The overall prevalence of HPV DNA was 86.6%, with 39.0% positive for HPV-16 DNA, 52.4% positive for HPV-18 DNA, and 13.4% positive for more than one HPV type. The age-adjusted relative risk of ACIS associated with HPV-18 seropositivity was 3.3 (95% confidence interval 2.2-4.9). No increased risk was associated with antibodies to HPV-16 L1. Among women born after 1945, the relative risk increased with duration of OC use, with the highest risk for 12 or more years of use (odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-14.6) relative to nonusers. The detection of HPV DNA in 86.6% of ACIS and the strong association of ACIS with HPV-18 L1 seropositivity underscore the importance of HPV, particularly HPV-18, in the etiology of ACIS. In addition, long-term OC use may contribute to the pathogenesis of these tumors in some women."

The study included 4,136 women >30 years of age. E6/E7 mRNA expression from the carcinogenic HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 45 was detected by the PreTect HPV-Proofer assay, whereas the presence of HPV DNA was detected by Gp5+/6+ consensus PCR followed by type-specific PCR. A total of 4.0% had an abnormal cytologic diagnosis, 3.0% were positive by PreTect HPV-Proofer, 4.4% by type-specific PCR, and 10.4% by consensus PCR. For detection of HPV in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), no significant difference was observed between PreTect HPV-Proofer and consensus PCR. For women with a cytologic normal, atypical squamous cell of uncertain significance, and low-grade SIL diagnosis, the detection rate of HPV was significantly higher by Gp5+/6+ consensus PCR (P < 0.005) than by PreTect HPV-Proofer. Histology confirmed 14 of 23 cytologic HSIL as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade >2. Of these women, PreTect HPV-Proofer and type-specific PCR detected 12, whereas consensus PCR detected 13. In conclusion, for HSIL, detection of E6/E7 transcripts from HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 45 are present to the same degree as DNA detected by consensus PCR. Equally important, only a small proportion of the HPV DNA-positive women with a normal, atypical squamous cell of uncertain significance or low-grade SIL diagnosis had a detectable mRNA expression. HPV E6/E7 mRNA detection by PreTect HPV-Proofer represents a new promising test as an adjunct to cytology."

The majority of women in screened populations, who test HPV positive, will have a concurrent normal smear, and we need more information about the risk for subsequent high-grade cervical lesions in these women. We examined 8,656 younger women (22-32 years old) and 1,578 older women (40-50 years old) who were followed for development of cervical neoplasia (cytology and/or histology) through the Danish Pathology Data Bank. We estimated the proportion of women developing cervical lesions of different types before a given time point as a function of time. Among women with normal cytology and positive high-risk Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) test, 17.7% and 24.5% of younger and older women, respectively, had a subsequent abnormal Pap smear within 5 years. The risk of CIN3 or cancer within 10 years among younger women with positive HC2 test was 13.6% (10.9-16.2) and 21.2% (2.7-36.1) among older women. An analysis among younger women also being HC2-positive 2 years before baseline showed a subsequent 10-year risk of > or =CIN3 of 18% (14.6-21.5). Among older women where HPV may be added to general screening, the estimated absolute risk of > or =CIN3 in HC2-positive women was more than 20% within 10 years. These results indicate that even a single positive HPV test in cytologically negative women is substantially predictive of high-grade CIN and suggest that HC2 testing can help stratify women into different risk categories."

Over one-half of women acquire the virus through heterosexual contact. The diagnoses that define the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and the use of antiretroviral therapy are similar in men and women, except in pregnancy. However, management decisions differ significantly regarding contraceptive and gynecologic care. Besides abstinence, use of the latex condom continues to be the most effective way of preventing transmission of HIV. The management of human papillomavirus-associated disease, pelvic inflammatory disease and vaginal candidiasis is especially challenging in women with HIV infection. A positive status for the virus does not appear to affect pregnancy outcome. Each year, up to 2,000 infants are born infected with HIV. Transmission can occur by transplacental or intrapartum spread or through breast milk. Since 1994, prophylaxis with zidovudine has been shown to be an effective method of limiting transmission to infants. It is important to offer all pregnant women a test for HIV, with counseling provided both before and after the test, even if testing does not become mandatory under the law."
CD008054,0,16299747,0,Resolving ASCUS without recourse to HPV testing: manual reprocessing of residual automated liquid-based cytology (ALBC) material using manual liquid-based cytology (MLBC).,"We show that residual cell material from ThinPrep PapTest (Cytyc Corporation, Boxborough, MA) atypical squamous-cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) cases may be manually reprocessed to triage women into actionable diagnostic categories (HSIL, LSIL, and Negative). Material remaining from each of 358 ThinPrep ASCUS cases was manually reprocessed as two slides, labeled ""A"" and ""B."" Interobserver agreement between case contributors (CCs) and three sequential reviewers (SRs) was analyzed with 186 cases (Study 1), and diagnostic reproducibility between SRs was examined with an additional 172 cases (Study 2). In Study 1, CCs classified 33% of cases as LSIL or greater, SRs classified 60% as LSIL or greater, and there was 58% diagnostic agreement between CCs and SRs. No ""Negative"" case assignment by one group afforded an ""HSIL"" assignment by the complementary group. In Study 2, there was 95% agreement between SRs A slide and B slide diagnoses with 54% of A slides and 55% of B slides classified as LISL or greater. Again, no ""Negative"" case assignment to one slide afforded an ""HSIL"" assignment to the complementary slide. Overall, 12.6% of the 358 cases showed HSIL, and all HSILs by one observer group were ASCUS or greater by the complementary observer group. Using manual reprocessing beyond the 21-day specimen outdate for HPV testing by the Hybrid Capture II High Risk HPV test (HR-HCII; Digene Corporation, Beltsville, MD), many ThinPrep ASCUS cases were reclassified as LSIL or HSIL. The 12.6% HSIL proportion of this study approximated the 11.5% CIN 2 or greater proportion of the ALTS ASCUS arm. Similar to ALTS, manual liquid-based cytology (MLBC) would have referred nearly 60% of women to colposcopy for a definitive diagnosis of HSIL or LSIL without resorting to HPV testing. These data demonstrate that many cases of automated liquid-based cytology (ALBC)-diagnosed ASCUS represent unrecognized SIL, which is present in the ALBC specimen vial at the time the ASCUS diagnosis is rendered."

Each year 80% of the 274,000 deaths caused by cervical cancer occur in developing nations like Nepal. Largest promise of this vaccine is in such countries where screening program is difficult to implement and maintain. However this also raises concerns and debates about the enduring effectiveness and the long term side effects of the vaccine, which are yet unknown. Garnering public trust and public acceptance is key to the success of any public health intervention.

To examine the relationships of these factors with CIN3, we conducted an analysis of women (n = 5,060) with minimally abnormal Pap smears who were enrolled in the ASCUS and LSIL Triage Study (ALTS), a clinical trial to evaluate management strategies. Cervical specimens collected at enrollment were tested for HPV DNA using 2 methods. Multivariate logistics regression models were used to assess associations (odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) of the potential risk factors (e.g., OC use and parity) with testing oncogenic HPV positive among controls (<CIN2) (n = 4,114) and with rigorously reviewed cases of CIN3 identified throughout the study (n = 499) among women with oncogenic HPV (n = 3,126). Only former oral contraceptive use (OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.0-1.7) was associated marginally with having an oncogenic HPV infection among controls. Restricted to women with oncogenic HPV, current injectable hormonal contraceptive users were at an elevated risk of CIN3 (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.1) compared to women who never used them. Similarly, restricted to women with HPV16 infection, current users of injectable contraceptives were at a marginally elevated risk of CIN3 (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0-2.3) compared to women who never used them. Oral contraceptive use, Norplant (implantable hormonal contraceptive) use, a history of pregnancy, age at first pregnancy, lifetime numbers of pregnancies and lifetime numbers of live births were not associated with CIN3. We conclude that only current injectable hormonal contraceptive use slightly elevated the risk (approximately 50%) of CIN3 in this young and low parity population of women with oncogenic HPV and minimally abnormal Pap smears but further confirmation of this relationship is needed."

Therefore, over the next several years it is likely that we will begin to switch from cervical cytology-based screening programs to programs based on testing for high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Multiple large, well-controlled screening trials have clearly demonstrated that HPV testing is considerably more sensitive than cytology (either conventional or liquid-based) and only slightly less specific when used in women 30 years of age and older. Initially, we will use a combination of cervical cytology and HPV testing to screen, but as more data from large screening studies become available, it is becoming clear that cytology provides little benefit over using HPV testing alone to screen. Therefore, in the future it is likely that we will use HPV testing alone to screen, and reserve cervical cytology as a way to determine which HPV-positive women require additional follow-up or colposcopy."

According to data from the National Institute of Public Health, in Croatia the incidence of cervical cancer was 14.9/100,000 in 2006, ranking eighth most common malignancy in women. Croatia has a lower incidence of the disease compared to many countries of Central and Southeast Europe. A large study carried out in 1995 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which included cervical cancer material collected from 22 countries all over the world revealed HPV genome in 99.7% of cases. Efficient methods of cervical cancer detection and screening methods for identification of precancerous lesions (conventional Pap smear) are available. Cervical cancer prevention programs should include education (of health care providers and women), stressing the benefits of screening, the age of the peak cervical cancer incidence, and the signs and symptoms of precancerous lesions and invasive disease. The aim of screening actions is to detect precancerous lesions that may lead to cancer if left untreated. Screening can only be effective if there is a well-organized system of follow up, diagnosis and treatment. Cervical cytology, or Papanicolaou (Pap) testing, has for decades been a cornerstone of cervical cancer screening. According to recent guidelines issued by the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, the primary task of the public health system is the introduction of secondary prevention through properly organized screening programs. Launching the national immunization program is only possible in the countries with well-organized secondary prevention programs and in those that can afford it."

Management of these lesions depends on their histologic confirmation. Misinterpretation especially for benign mimics results in a significant diagnostic disagreement. For these reasons, a continuous effort is still needed to discover surrogate markers, which could support the final diagnosis. Archival biopsies of normal ectocervical and endocervical tissues, squamous metaplasia, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma in situ, and adenocarcinoma were retrieved to perform a tissue microarray (TMA). A panel of markers was tested on the TMA obtained slides by in situ hybridization (HPV DNA) and immunohistochemistry (p16, involucrin, Ki-67, and HPV L1 proteins). The sensitivity to detect high-risk HPV DNA increased with lesion's severity. In situ hybridization signals suggesting integrated viral physical status predominated in CIN II/III, squamous cell carcinoma, and glandular (pre) neoplastic lesions. The p16 and Ki-67 protein expression increased from CIN I to CIN III and to infiltrative lesions. Involucrin positivity was better appreciated in well-differentiated diagnostic entities (ectocervix, mature metaplasia, and CIN I). HPV L1 antibody detected the viral capsid protein in a low proportion of CIN I and II. In conclusion, using a panel of cervical biomarkers improves the final reporting of various HPV-induced epithelial lesions. Carefully constructed TMA with single spots of 1-mm diameter are powerful tools, which have a high reliability in representing full tissue sections."

CD008054,0,12133661,0,Viral load of human papillomavirus and risk of CIN3 or cervical cancer.,"Carcinogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) are thought to be necessary for development of cervical cancer. We assessed whether higher viral loads of such viruses predicted future risk of CIN3 or cancer (CIN3+) in a cohort of 20810 women followed up for 10 years with cytological screening. We measured the viral load for 13 types of carcinogenic HPV (relative light units normalised to 1 pg/mL HPV 16 positive controls [RLU/PC]) using Hybrid Capture 2 testing of cervicovaginal lavages obtained at enrolment. Results were stratified into four groups (RLU/PC 1 to <10, 10 to <100, 100 to <1000, > or = 1000). Although presence of HPV strongly increased risk of CIN3+, high viral load did not further predict risk of CIN3+."

CD008054,0,9118404,0,Analysis of tumor spillage during radical prostatectomy using RT-PCR of prostate specific antigen.,"Recent reports have suggested the shedding of cancer cells during radical extirpation of tumors. Prostate cells can be expressed from the prostate ex vivo and found in the expressed prostatic secretions. We conducted an in vivo study to determine if prostate epithelial cells can be found in the operative site as determined by RT-PCR targeted at prostate specific antigen (PSA) and to correlate this with pathologic stage and outcome. We analyzed 14 consecutive radical retropubic prostatectomy procedures with a minimum 1-year follow-up. Intraoperatively, 5-10 ml of fluid (representing blood, urine, and irrigant) was aspirated from the operative field at three time points: after transaction of the dorsal vein complex, urethra, and bladder neck. Ficoll gradient fractionation was carried out on the specimens, and RNA was extracted from the cell pellet. Quality of RNA and presence of the PSA mRNA was determined by RT-PCR targeted at actin and PSA, respectively, using previously published primers. The medical records were reviewed for pathologic stage. There were nine patients with extraprostatic disease and five patients with organ confined disease. Five of 14 (36%) patients tested positive for prostate epithelial cells in the operative field at one or more points during radical prostatectomy. All five positive RT-PCR PSA assays were in patients with locally advanced disease, whereas all of the patients with organ-confined disease were negative for RT-PCR. This preliminary in vivo study suggests that locally advanced prostate cancer may be associated with PSA expressing cells in the operative field during radical prostatectomy. The clinical significance of this is unclear, but this finding suggests that shedding of cells in the operative field is more likely with locally advanced disease."
CD008054,0,11563873,0,The role of human papillomavirus vaccines in cervical neoplasia.,"Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in women, in some developing countries accounting for the highest cancer mortality. The evidence for the association of high-risk human papillomavirus types with the aetiology of cervical neoplasia is firmly established, human papillomavirus being detected in virtually all cervical cancers. The risk of progression of precursor cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia lesions is associated with persistence of human papillomavirus infection. One strategy for the management of cervical neoplasia worldwide could be the development of prophylactic and/or therapeutic human papillomavirus vaccines. This chapter will discuss the natural history of human papillomavirus infection, viral immunity and the clinical course of resultant disease as the background to the effective design and use of human papillomavirus vaccines for protection or therapy. The progress of ongoing phase I and II clinical trials for several different vaccine preparations and the challenges for establishing their future use will be discussed."
CD008054,0,19624866,0,Predicting the response of advanced cervical and ovarian tumors to therapy.,"The management of advanced cervical and ovarian cancers remains a significant challenge as many women fail to respond to recommended therapy, resulting in disease progression and ultimately patient death. Because of tumor heterogeneity, it is rare for all cancers of a particular type to respond to a specific therapy; and, as a result, many patients receive treatment from which they derive little or no benefit, leading to increased morbidity and undue costs. A marker that could rapidly predict or forecast disease outcome would clearly be beneficial in allowing the administration of a tailored regime for each patient while reducing toxicity and cost. Traditional prognostic factors of tumor size, grade, and stage are not ideal for predicting patient outcome, whereas the use of in vitro assays to detect chemosensitivity or resistance has not yet translated into routine clinical practice. Similarly, biomarkers and tumor markers vary in their predictive ability. DNA array technology offers great promise in predicting the response to therapy based on gene expression profiles, and can allow for targeted therapies against specific molecular alterations that cause disease. Imaging techniques, particularly those with the ability to characterize biological tissues and provide functional, structural, and molecular information, have the potential to noninvasively integrate physical and metabolic information. These include F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging, all techniques that attempt to evaluate and predict therapy response and so influence clinical outcome. This review examines different methods of predicting the response to treatment in advanced cervical and ovarian tumors."

CD008054,0,20868401,0,"An overview of human papillomavirus infection for the dermatologist: disease, diagnosis, management, and prevention.","Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common, usually transient, dermatologic infection transmitted by genital contact that can cause a variety of anogenital diseases, including warts (condyloma), dysplasia (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal), and squamous cell carcinoma. A number of treatment modalities are available to treat anogenital warts, both patient- and provider-applied. Treatment is efficacious, but lesions can recur. Bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines are approved to prevent HPV infection. Both are indicated to prevent cervical cancer, while the quadrivalent vaccine is also approved to prevent vaginal/vulvar cancers as well as genital warts in males and females. Providers should clearly explain the natural history and potential sequelae of HPV disease, counsel patients on prevention strategies, and recommend vaccination as an effective method of prevention to their patients."
CD008054,0,11905599,0,Persistent human papillomavirus infection and cervical neoplasia.,"The development of cervical cancer is preceded by precursor lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). Evidence-based epidemiological and molecular data suggest that persistent infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) types that carry ahigh oncogenic risk are the intermediate endpoints, leading to both intraepithelial and invasive cervical neoplasia. Integration of highly oncogenic HPVs into host-cell chromosomes is followed by binding of HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins to tumour-suppressor genes p53 and RB, respectively. This process results in impaired tumour-suppressor-gene function, involving DNA repair, decreased apoptosis, and eventual cell immortalisation. Mutations causing chromosomal alterations, loss of heterozygosity, and proto-oncogene and telomerase activation in immunopermissive individuals have important roles in virus-induced cervical carcinogenesis. The so-called non-European variants of HPV 16 and 18 may increase the degradation potential of p53. HPV 16 is polymorphic and, although the evidence is controversial, the Arg/Arg genotype of p53 could have greater susceptibility to HPV-E6 degradation than the other genotypes. The coincident interplay between the non-European genomic variants of HPV 16/18 and p53 Arg/Arg may explain, at least in part, the persistence of HPV infection and tumour progression in women with cervical neoplasia. Further epidemiological and molecular research is needed, to gain insight into HPV-mediated cervical carcinogenesis. The evidence highlights the need to develop appropriate prophylactic HPV vaccines and diagnostic and screening tests."

CD008054,0,18060328,0,Nonsexual transmission of anogenital warts in children: a retrospective analysis.,"The purpose was to evaluate the prevalence of sexual abuse in patients who were referred to a pediatric gynecologist for evaluation based on the clinical findings of anogenital warts. A retrospective analysis was performed on 131 patients between the ages 6 month and 9 years referred to a pediatric gynecologist after the finding of anogenital warts by a clinical provider, parent or caregiver. A complete physical examination under colposcopy by a the same, trained pediatric gynecologist was completed, and a complete medical and family history including maternal and sibling history for evidence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and anogenital warts. The legal system completed a full investigation to examine the sexual abuse allegations. In 131 patients with anogenital warts, a maternal history of warts, cervical dysplasia or both was present in 66 (50%). The remaining patients had either a negative maternal history for HPV clinical findings (54 patients or 41.2%), or maternal history was unknown (11 patients, or 8.3%). Of 131 patients, 81 (61%) patients had a sibling. Of those with siblings 40 (49.4%) had warts and 41 (50.6%) did not. Forty-five (34%) of the cases had a positive maternal history for warts, dysplasia or both but also had a sibling. In that cohort, 32 (71%) of the siblings also had anogenital warts. Three of 131 patients were ruled suspicious for sexual abuse by the legal authorities but not confirmed. Of those three patients two were female and one was male. Two had no maternal history for HPV and both of these patients had a sibling without anogenital warts. Most cases of anogenital warts in children are likely to be the result of non-sexual transmission, namely prenatal mode. Thus, these patients should be handled differently by the legal system unless other reasons for suspicion exist. This study also showed the importance of maternal gynecologic history."
CD008054,0,12552985,0,Is therapeutic conization sufficient to eliminate a high-risk HPV infection of the uterine cervix? A clinicopathological analysis.,High-risk human papillomavirus infection plays a predominant role in the pathogenesis of preinvasive and invasive cervical cancer. One of the recognized treatments of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is conization. The aim of this study was to evaluate if cold-knife conization is sufficient to eliminate cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and the associated high-risk HPV infection.
CD008054,0,18006667,0,Evidence of HPV16 integration in low- and high-grade cervical lesions that regress demonstrated by multiple displacement amplification and Southern blot hybridisation.,"The prevalence and significance of human papillomavirus (HPV) integration among different grades of cervical lesions is uncertain. In this study, HPV physical status was examined by the combination of multiple displacement amplification (MDA) with Southern blot hybridisation (SBH). DNA extracts from 95 cervical cytology samples (NILM, ASC-US, LSIL, ASC-H, HSIL) were subject to whole genome amplification by MDA followed by SBH with [alpha-(32)P]-labelled HPV probes. Mixed HPV16 episomal/integrant sequences were detected in three ASC-US patients (two diagnosed with benign changes and one with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2/3 after biopsy follow-up), one ASC-H patient with CIN2/3 histological diagnosis, and one HSIL patient with benign changes. Additional follow-up cytological data available for three of these patients demonstrated series of lesion-free samples. The data support the view that integration can occur in low-grade lesions and that lesions with mixed episomal/integrant HPV can regress."
CD008054,0,17549362,0,A comparison of liquid-based cytology and Pap smear as a screening method for cervical cancer.,"The implementation of population-based screening for cervical cancer with Pap smear in the early sixties was set to detect and treat precancerous lesions, hopefully preventing a subsequent invasive cervical cancer. Epidemiological data indicate that organized screening has a major impact on morbidity and mortality from cervical cancer. The limited sensitivity of a single smear necessitates repeated smears in organized program. It is suggested that liquid-based cytology improves the sensitivity. The aim of this split-sample study was to compare ThinPrep liquid-based cytology with conventional Pap smear, relying on a laboratory with long-term experience of the latter. In total, 137 women with atypical Pap smear in population-based cervical screening were enrolled for the split-sample study. The performance of both techniques (ThinPrep liquid-based cytology and conventional Pap smear) were compared and validated by a histological follow-up. Women without representative histological biopsy were excluded from the study. Pap smear had sensitivity for detection of CIN2-3 of 47% compared to 66% for liquid-based material. The concordance of the two sampling techniques with the histological diagnosis was 37% and 53%, respectively, this difference being statistically significant. The proportion of reports on atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) was significantly less in the liquid-based material, 4.3% compared to 8% of the conventional smears. This improved sensitivity in combination with the possibility to perform reflex testing such as HPV DNA or p16 immunocytochemistry without renewed sampling gives ThinPrep a substantial advantage and makes the liquid-based technique interesting."
CD008054,0,16240403,0,Coming to terms with Vietnam: the Viet/American Cervical Cancer Prevention Project.,"The Viet/American Cervical Cancer Prevention Project embraces a dual mission. We seek to develop sustainable, cost-effective cervical cancer prevention services for women in Vietnam. Because the problem of cervical cancer in Vietnam is in part a legacy of the Second Indochinese War, we also seek to examine obstacles to reconciliation by presenting what most acknowledge to be a remedy in advance of what some will perceive to be an accusation. Certain research and commercial interests have produced obstacles to our dual mission in Vietnam. The Alliance for Cervical Cancer Prevention, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, has failed to endorse Pap screening for developing countries and is conducting clinical trials which may further disaffect medically underserved groups. Visual screening techniques combined with immediate ablative treatment methods are incompatible with the requirements of ""first do no harm."" Because the Pap smear will probably be a component of any future human papillomavirus (HPV)-based or visual- based screening programs, it serves the interests of those promoting noncytologic screening methods to also support the development of Pap screening services. Research on HPV screening in developing countries raises concerns of commercial exploitation. Because Pap screening is feasible wherever cervical screening is appropriate, it is inappropriate to delay the development of Pap screening services pending research into HPV vaccines or alternative screening technologies. Quality management is the point at which public health and diagnostic pathology intersect and will remain an indispensable element of cervical screening programs irrespective of the screening test(s) eventually used. Pap screening in developing countries is an ethical imperative without a substantial political constituency and will benefit from the engagement of organized cytology."

All the men had lesions on the penis. In the women, five lesions were on the vulva, four were on the cervix and two were on the vagina (two women each had two involved sites). The histologic slides from the surgically excised specimens were reviewed, and, by applying strict criteria, all cases could be reclassified as giant condyloma (five cases), intraepithelial neoplasia with or without condylomatous features (eight cases) or invasive squamous cell carcinoma (five cases). The authors believe that, in genital lesions associated with the human papillomavirus, a diagnosis of verrucous carcinoma is nonspecific and may lead to inappropriate clinical management."
CD008054,0,9862518,0,High-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in pregnancy: clinicotherapeutic management.,An increasing incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) among young women has been noticed in recent years. For this reason pregnancy might represent a peculiar opportunity to undergo cytocolposcopic examination for those women who do not take part in a screening program for cervical carcinoma. Diagnosis of CIN during pregnancy poses the question of the management of this disease and particularly of whether it is better to treat the lesion or not during pregnancy. To contribute to the solution of this issue we initiated a study on the management of high-grade CIN in pregnancy.

CD008054,0,8682616,0,Natural history of cervical human papillomavirus lesions.,"A total of 87 HPV-positive patients with grade I and II cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I and II) were followed up by cytology and colposcopy every 3 months for more than 5 years following the first biopsy. These patients were classified into three groups (progressive, persistent, and regressive disease) according to the results. The human papillomavirus (HPV) genome and viral types were identified by Southern blot hybridization at Tm-40 degrees and Tm-20 degrees with DNA extracted from exfoliated cervical cells. The lesion progressed to CIN III in 4/87 patients (4.6%), persisted in 39 patients (44.8%), and regressed in 44 patients (50.6%). In the progressive disease group, HPV 16 was detected in 2 patients, HPV 33 in 1 patient, and HPV 52 in 1 patient. In the persistent disease group, HPV 58 was predominant (28%), whereas in the regressive disease group, there was no predominant HPV type. In 10/39 patients from the persistent disease group, cytological examination transiently revealed severe dysplasia and/or findings similar to carcinoma in situ. These patients showed severe cytological abnormalities only once or twice during the follow-up. These results suggest that the natural history of CIN possibly depends upon the type of HPV that infects the cervix, and the relative risk of progression was similar to that shown by previous cross-sectional studies."

CD008054,0,12433717,0,Restricted cross-reactivity of hybrid capture 2 with nononcogenic human papillomavirus types.,"Hybrid Capture 2 Test using probe B (HC2-B) is a clinical test for the detection of 13 human papillomavirus (HPV) types associated with cervical cancer (oncogenic types), but the potential clinical significance of HC2-B cross-reactivity with untargeted (nononcogenic) HPV types has not been fully evaluated. Thus, HC2-B test results on 954 clinical cervical specimens from a population-based natural history study of HPV in Costa Rica were compared with the data from testing of the same specimens twice by HPV type-specific MY09/MY11 L1 consensus primer PCR. Specimens positive by PCR for single HPV types not targeted by HC2-B were used for determining type-specific cross-reactivity. Effects of cross-reactivity on clinical performance were estimated by calculating sensitivity and specificity with and without cross-reactivity for the detection of high-grade cervical lesions. HC2-B tested positive for single infections by untargeted (cross-reactive) types 11, 53, 61, 66, 67, 70, 71, and 81. Cross-reactivity was strongly associated with PCR signal strength (P(Trend) = 0.0001) and cervical abnormalities (P = 0.0002, Pearson chi(2)). We estimated that HC2-B cross-reactivity resulted in minor changes in screening performance. Clinical sensitivity increased from 84.3% to 87.9%, clinical specificity decreased from 89.6% to 88.1%, and referral rates increased from 11.7% to 13.2% for detection of >or=cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2. The clinical effect of cross-reactivity varied by cytologic interpretation. Among women with normal cytologic interpretations, cross-reactivity significantly improved the accuracy of identifying cytologically nonevident histology of >or=cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 because of increased sensitivity with maintained specificity. However, among women with equivocal or mildly abnormal cytologic interpretations, cross-reactivity decreased the accuracy of HPV testing because of substantial decreases in specificity. In summary, cross-reactivity with nononcogenic HPV types had little effect on the overall clinical performance of HC2-B as a general screening test, but reduction of cross-reactivity might improve the performance of HPV testing for triage of equivocal or mildly abnormal cytologic interpretations."

We found 43 (19.9%) specimens including cervical tissue with some histologic sign of pathology. Twenty-five (11.6%) had histologic features suggestive for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, while 18 (8.3%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Of the 18 CIN cases, 9 were CIN I, 6 CIN II and 3 CIN III. Altogether, the prevalence of dysplasia in postmenopausal women with recently referred normal cervical cytology was impressive. A significant number of dysplastic lesions (14 out of 18, 77.7%) did not present any histologic sign of HPV. Also, none of the histologic diagnoses of sub-clinical HPV infection was confirmed by the in situ hybridization. Considering the significant prevalence of high grade lesions (9 CIN II and III, 4.2% of the analysed samples) found in this randomly selected patient population, our data strongly suggest the need for a regular follow-up of the transformation zone in all postmenopausal women. Although in women of postmenopausal age some low grade lesions seem to have only a reactive-reparative significance, a more accurate screening procedure, taking into account the peculiar modifications of the menopausal uterine cervix, is advisable."
CD008054,0,8631589,0,Can papilloma virus testing be used to improve cervical cancer screening?,"This report investigates different options for using human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in cervical cancer prevention. These options are evaluated by a stochastic model of the progression of pre-malignancy and its relationship to HPV infection. Three screening policies are compared: 2 based on cytological screening, with or without HPV testing, and 1 in which HPV testing is the primary screening method. A policy of HPV testing for women with mildly abnormal smears would have little effect on the overall incidence of invasive cancer when compared with a policy of repeat cytology, provided follow-up is efficient. Moreover, the potential value of HPV testing as a primary screening method is strongly dependent on the proportion of neoplasias that are HPV-negative. Important factors in assessing the future role of HPV testing would be cost-effectiveness and benefits from improved compliance."

Mortality rates in the region are seven times greater than in North America. In light of the significant public health burden, the Pan American Health Organization has drafted a Regional Strategy for Cervical Cancer Prevention and Control. The Strategy calls for increased action to strengthen programmes through an integrated package of services: health information and education; screening and pre-cancer treatment; invasive cervical cancer treatment and palliative care; and evidence-based policy decisions on whether and how to introduce human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. It calls for a seven-point plan of action: conduct a situation analysis; intensify information, education and counselling; scale up screening and link to pre-cancer treatment; strengthen information systems and cancer registries; improve access to and quality of cancer treatment and palliative care; generate evidence to facilitate decision-making regarding HPV vaccine introduction; and advocate for equitable access and affordable HPV vaccines.

CD008054,0,19027626,0,"Benefits, cost requirements and cost-effectiveness of the HPV16,18 vaccine for cervical cancer prevention in developing countries: policy implications.","Approximately 70% of cases of cervical cancer worldwide are caused by genotypes 16 and 18 of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is sexually transmitted. With the availability of an effective vaccine against these HPV types, there is real hope for reducing the global burden of cervical cancer in developing countries. Stakeholders faced with decisions about where to invest money to improve health must consider the burden of disease caused by cervical cancer relative to other priorities and the comparative benefits of different interventions. We conducted a series of analyses to obtain information for agencies drafting immunisation policy recommendations, financing coordination mechanisms, and country decision-makers on the benefits, cost requirements and cost-effectiveness of the HPV16,18 vaccine. We found that making an HPV16,18 vaccine accessible to 70% of young adolescent girls in 72 of the poorest countries, China, Thailand, and all of Latin America and the Caribbean, could prevent the future deaths of more than four million women vaccinated over the next decade. Provided the cost per vaccinated girl is less than $10-$25, adolescent HPV16,18 vaccination would be cost-effective even in relatively poor countries. Concerns about financial costs and affordability highlight the need for lowering vaccine prices, cost-efficient mechanisms for delivery of vaccinations to adolescents, and creative sources of financing."
CD008054,0,8177987,0,Design and analysis considerations in a cohort study involving repeated measurement of both exposure and outcome: the association between genital papillomavirus infection and risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Cohort studies commonly involve a single determination of exposure, and one or more assessments of whether or not the outcome of interest has occurred. This approach is appropriate when the exposure does not change with time, and when one can readily determine the time of outcome (for example, mortality). If either of these conditions is not met, however, we may introduce bias into the estimate of effect, since we may misclassify individual members of the cohort with respect to exposure, outcome or both. We can reduce this bias by measuring exposure and outcome on more than one occasion. In this paper, we illustrate the design and analysis issues that arise in such circumstances, by reference to an ongoing prospective study of the relationship between genital papillomavirus infection and risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. This study entails annual assessments of the status of the study subjects with respect to both conditions. In particular, we examine the implications that use of this design has on the statistical power of the study."
CD008054,0,17722112,0,High load for most high risk human papillomavirus genotypes is associated with prevalent cervical cancer precursors but only HPV16 load predicts the development of incident disease.,"Cervicovaginal human papillomavirus (HPV) viral load has been purported as a potential marker for the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer (>/=CIN2). To examine disease association with type-specific viral load for the full-range of anogenital HPV infections, we conducted cross-sectional and prospective analyses of approximately 2,000 HPV-infected women from a 10,000-woman population-based study in Guanacaste, Costa Rica with 7 years of follow-up. Cervical specimens were tested for >40 HPV types using a MY09/MY11 L1 consensus primer PCR method with type-specific dot blot hybridization and PCR signal intensity as a measure of viral load. A positive association was observed between prevalent >/=CIN2 and high viral load compared to low viral load for women with baseline single HPV16 infections (OR = 19.2, 95% CI = 4.4-83.2) and single non-16 carcinogenic infections (OR = 9.2, 95% CI = 2.1-39.9). Inclusion of women with multiple HPV types did not substantially change these associations. In prospective follow-up, only women infected with HPV16 alone (OR = 27.2, 95% = 3.5-213.5) had a strong association between high viral load and incident >/=CIN2; non-16 carcinogenic high viral load was not associated with incident >/=CIN2 (OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.2-1.9). Single noncarcinogenic type viral load was not associated with increased risk of prevalent or incident >/=CIN2 (OR = 1.2 and 1.1, respectively). In conclusion, carcinogenic high viral load was associated with prevalent >/=CIN2; however HPV16 was uniquely associated with incident >/=CIN2. The extent to which these observations can be translated into clinical practice must be rigorously examined in the context of the method of viral load measurement and the type-specific differences observed for incident >/=CIN2."

This review utilizes MEDLINE and National Library of Medicine's PubMed review of the various screening tools used in follow-up protocols for women treated by loop excision for CIN. Cervical cytology, colposcopy, endocervical curettage and HPV typing have been advocated for use as tools for follow up. Involvement of the surgical margins and the presence of HPV-DNA are associated with higher risks of recurrence and should be taken into consideration. The psychological impact of undergoing colposcopy may affect compliance with follow-up visits and should be dealt with appropriately."
CD008054,0,17258503,0,Review of current knowledge on HPV vaccination: an appendix to the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Cervical Cancer Screening.,"The recognition of a strong etiological relationship between infection with high-risk human papillomavirusses and cervical cancer has prompted research to develop and evaluate prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. One prophylactic quadrivalent vaccine using L1 virus-like particles (VLP) of HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 is available on the European market since the end of 2006 and it is expected that a second bivalent vaccine containing VLPs of HPV16 and HPV18 will become available in 2007. Each year, HPV16 and HPV18 cause approximately 43,000 cases of cervical cancer in the European continent. Results from the phase-IIb and III trials published thus far indicate that the L1 VLP HPV vaccine is safe and well-tolerated. It offers HPV-naive women a very high level of protection against HPV persistent infection and cervical intra-epithelial lesions associated with the types included in the vaccine. HPV vaccination should be offered to girls before onset of sexual activity. While prophylactic vaccination is likely to provide important future health gains, cervical screening will need to be continued for the whole generation of women that is already infected with the HPV types included in the vaccine. Phase IV studies are needed to demonstrate protection against cervical cancer and to verify duration of protection, occurrence of replacement by non-vaccine types and to define future policies for screening of vaccinated cohorts. The European Guidelines on Quality Assurance for Cervical Cancer Screening provides guidance for secondary prevention by detection and management of precursors lesions of the cervix. The purpose of the appendix on vaccination is to present current knowledge. Developing guidelines for future use of HPV vaccines in Europe, is the object of a new grant offered by the European Commission."
CD008054,0,1512167,0,"Tumor cell kinetics, local tumor control, and accelerated radiotherapy: a preliminary report.","The local tumor control achieved in patients treated in a pilot study of continuous, hyperfractionated, accelerated radiotherapy has been related to the tumor cell kinetics evaluated by in vivo administration of bromodeoxyuridine and flow cytometry. In 42 of 50 patients with advanced squamous cell carcinomas in the head and neck region it was possible to sample the primary tumor prior to treatment. In three further cases, involved regional nodes were studied: in the remaining five, tissue was obtained subsequently either from a local recurrence or from a distant metastasis. Successful cell kinetic measurements were made in 38 (90%) of the 42 primary tumors. The median values of the labelling index, the duration of the DNA synthetic phase and, thus, the potential doubling time for all primaries were 7.1%, 9.8 hr, and 3.9 days, respectively. Complete regression was achieved in 28 (74%) of the primary tumors and in 23 (61%) this was maintained to the time of observation for this report. There was no significant influence of any of the cell kinetic parameters upon the immediate or longer term local tumor control. This result is compatible with the overcoming of cellular repopulation by the acceleration of radiotherapy."
CD008054,0,9584046,0,"Expression of keratin 13, 14 and 19 in oral hyperplastic and dysplastic lesions from Sudanese and Swedish snuff-dippers: association with human papillomavirus infection.","Changes in the expression of keratins (Ks), indicating disturbed tissue differentiation, is one possible marker of malignant potential in stratified squamous epithelia. The presence of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) in the epithelium of the uterine cervix is increasingly regarded as a marker of risk for cervical cancer: However, a similar role in oral cancer and precancer remains controversial. To address these questions, potentially malignant oral mucosal lesions from Sudanese (9 hyperplasias/40 dysplasias) and Swedish (15 hyperplasias) snuff-dippers were examined by immunohistochemistry for expression of K types 13, 14 and 19 using monoclonal antibodies directed against each. HPV infection was searched for by in situ hybridization (ISH) using the cocktail HPV OmniProbe and the ViraType probe. For the Sudanese lesions, moderate to intense expression of both K13 (basal, basal/intermediate, basal/intermediate/superficial and intermediate/superficial cell layers) and K14 (basal, basal/intermediate cell layers) was found in 49/49 (100%). For the Swedish lesions, weak to moderate expression of K13 (basal, basal/intermediate cell layers) was found in 12/15 (80%) and 10/15 (67%), respectively. In the Sudanese lesions, expression of K13 showed a distinct pattern through the oral mucosa and its verrucous projections, with an increase towards the superficial cell layers of dysplastic, but not hyperplastic epithelium. K19 was expressed in the basal cell layer in 16/49 (33%) of the Sudanese lesions, while all the Swedish lesions were negative. HPV was found in only 2 Sudanese cases, both of which harboured both type 6 and type 11: both these cases demonstrated mild epithelial dysplasia, The present study shows that a) there is a high prevalence of expression of both K13 and K14 in oral lesions from Sudanese toombak dippers indicating dysregulation of keratinocyte maturation b) one-third of the Sudanese oral lesions expressed K19, regarded as a basal keratin representing epithelial dedifferentiation, which may prove to be a valuable risk marker in follow-up studies c) HPV genome is found infrequently in oral lesions from Sudanese toombak-dippers, suggesting that these viruses may not play a prominent role in the early stages of carcinogenesis in these subjects. These markers were less often expressed in the Swedish lesions, consistent with their much lower rate of malignant transformation."
CD008054,0,19956062,0,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma with prominent hobnail features: a new aggressive variant of moderately differentiated papillary carcinoma. A clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular study of eight cases.","Papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) are the most common thyroid tumors that usually have a good prognosis. Recurrence, metastases, and cancer death may occur in a few patients and are more commonly associated with more aggressive tumors, such as tall cell, columnar cell, or diffuse sclerosing variants of the PTC. We present the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of a rare aggressive variant of the PTC showing prominent hobnail features. The patients included 6 females and 2 males. Ages ranged from 28 to 78 years (mean 57.6). Patients presented with a neck mass and cervical lymphadenopathy. Tumor size ranged from 1.0 cm to 4.0 cm (mean 2.5 cm). The tumors were usually multifocal with variably sized complex papillary structures lined by cells with increased nuclear/cytoplasmatic ratios and apically placed nuclei that produced a surface bulge (hobnail appearance). Thyroglobulin, TTF-1, HBME-1, and p53 were positive in all cases, and there was membrane staining for beta-catenin and E-cadherin. The proliferative index with Ki67 ranged from 2% to 20% with a mean of 10%. BRAF mutation was present in 4/7 (57.1%) cases. Distant metastases to liver, lung, bone, brain, muscle, and pancreas developed in 5 patients. The average follow-up time was 77.2 months. Four patients died of disease after a mean of 42.8 months. Two patients are alive with disease after 4 and 87 months, respectively. Two patients are alive without disease after 120 and 236 months. PTC with a prominent hobnail pattern is a moderately differentiated PTC variant with aggressive clinical behavior and significant mortality."
CD008054,0,7675478,0,Relation between age and head and neck cancer recurrence after surgery: a multivariate analysis.,"Recent reports have described an increase in squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract in young adults. As the preponderance of epidemiologic data exists for the population between 50 and 70 years of age, controversy has developed regarding the clinical course of head and neck cancer in youth. Some authors advocate more aggressive management, calling attention to the lack of ""classic"" predisposing factors and suggesting genetic disorders or immunodeficiency. Basic science researchers have reported greater DNA fragility, sensitivity to carcinogens, and altered immune responses in young patients with carcinoma. To further elucidate the clinical aspects of this controversy, we performed a retrospective review using multivariate analysis to determine factors that affect recurrence. After screening 820 charts, 155 patients were found who met strict entrance criteria to the study. The patients were separated into five age groups, and 16 clinical variables were collected on each patient. Cox proportional hazards modeling revealed no significantly higher likelihood of recurrence in the 15- to 39-year-old age group. The model did find that metastatic adenopathy was predictive of recurrence (p = 0.034). The overall model further suggested a trend toward higher relative risk of recurrence in the middle-aged groups (p = 0.0541). In our review of the English biomedical literature, this is the first study to directly compare the outcome of young head and neck cancer patients with that of old patients using multivariate analysis. Future research is indicated in developing precise outcome predictions according to TNM staging, aneuploidy status, and DNA fragility in young patients. Efforts at limiting carcinogen exposure should continue."

Smear specimens were taken from 513 women and colpography was performed before and after acetic acid application with a digital camera. The women who had cervical lesions and/or aceto-white epithelium during the gynecological examination and/or had pathological findings in the smear and/or had suspicious findings at the colpography were invited (n=125, 24.4%) to the Department of Gynecology for colposcopic evaluation. Colposcopy was performed to 77 and biopsies were taken from 40 of the women during colposcopic examination.

CD008054,0,10478145,0,Subclassifying atypical squamous cells in Thin-Prep cervical cytology correlates with detection of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA.,"Recent studies have proposed subclassifying ASCUS into ""favor reactive"" (ASFR), ""not otherwise specified"" (ASNOS), and ""favor squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL)"" (ASFS). This study explored the reproducibility of these diagnoses with Thin-Prep cytology and their association with high-risk human papillomavirus DNA (HRHPV). Three pathologists and 1 cytotechnologist with 2 to 25 years of experience reviewed 144 Thin-Prep (Cytyc, Boxborough, MA) specimens previously diagnosed as normal, ASFR, ASNOS, ASFS, and SIL. Interobserver reproducibility was computed with the kappa statistic. The original laboratory diagnosis was compared with the presence of HRHPV types. Interobserver reproducibility for a normal or SIL diagnosis was very good (kappa = .68 and .63). Reproducibility for ASFR, ASNOS, and ASFS ranged from poor to fair (kappa = .21, .19, and .32). In a weighted analysis, kappa values for ASFR/ASNOS and ASFS/SIL were .36 and .62, respectively. HRHPV-positivity for preparations originally diagnosed as N, ASFR, ASNOS, ASFS, and SIL were 5.7%, 8.8%, 17.4%, 47.8%, and 54.5%, respectively. The difference in index of HRHPV for either N or ASFR and ASFS or SIL was significant (P < .001). Reproducibility for ASCUS is generally poor, but better reproducibility is obtained by combining ASFS with SIL and, to a lesser degree, ASNOS with ASFR. ASFS and SIL confer a similar index of HRHPV and merit similar management. ASFR may be managed with cytologic follow-up; but this may depend upon the individual laboratory. HPV testing, in conjunction with cytologic and biopsy follow-up, appears useful for estimating the significance of ASCUS subgroups in laboratory practice."

CD008054,0,11927494,0,Acquisition and natural history of human papillomavirus type 16 variant infection among a cohort of female university students.,"Analogous to the epidemiology of different types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs), variants of a single type such as HPV16 may differ in the natural course of infection. A prospective study was conducted in a cohort of female university students who did not have HPV16 DNA or antibody at enrollment. Subjects were followed every 4 months with Pap smear and colposcopic examinations and tests for HPV DNA and antibody. Of 528 women, 62 acquired HPV16 infection during follow-up. The 5-year cumulative incidence was 12.6% for infection with HPV16 prototype-like variants and 3.1% for infection with non-prototype-like (NPL) variants. Among those with incident HPV16 infection, the adjusted odds ratio of detecting NPL variants was 6.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-27.5)] for nonwhite women or white women who had had nonwhite sex partners compared with white women who had not had nonwhite sex partners. As compared with women who had not used hormonal contraceptives in the 8 months prior to the first HPV16-positive detection, the adjusted odds ratio of detecting NPL variants increased from 1.6 (95% CI, 0.3-9.1) for those who had used hormonal contraceptives for 1-4 months to 5.4 (95% CI, 1.0-28.3) for those who had used hormonal contraceptives for 5-8 months (P for trend = 0.04). There was no difference in HPV16 seroconversion rates between women with prototype-like variants and women with NPL variants. The increased risk for biopsy-confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 or 3 associated with detection of incident infection by NPL variants was not explained by differences in persistence between the two variant groups, indicating that biological mechanisms other than viral persistence may be responsible for the observed difference in risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 or 3."

CD008054,0,16189520,0,Routine cervical screening with primary HPV testing and cytology triage protocol in a randomised setting.,"The role of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing in primary cervical screening has not been established. We generated a randomised evaluation design ultimately to clarify whether primary hrHPV testing implemented into routine screening can bring increase in the programme effectiveness. The aim of the present report on first-year results was to assess the cross-sectional relative validity parameters for routine hrHPV screening, in comparison with conventional screening. An equal number of women invited to routine screening was randomly allocated to primary hrHPV screening (n=7060) and to cytological screening (n=7089). In the hrHPV screening arm, after a single positive hrHPV test result, the need of colposcopy referral was determined by a cytological triage test. Compared with the conventional arm, more colposcopy referrals were made in the hrHPV screening arm (relative risk 1.51, confidence interval 95% 1.03-2.22). Specificity of the primary screening with sole hrHPV test (91.5-92.1%) was much lower than that with the cytology triage (98.7-99.3%), which was not quite as specific as screening with conventional cytology (99.2-99.6%). Compared with conventional cytology, primary screening with hrHPV test results in increased cross-sectional relative sensitivity at the level of all positive lesions at the cost of substantial loss in specificity. With cytology triage, the specificity improves to the level of conventional cytology."
CD008054,0,18449888,0,Variants in DNA double-strand break repair and DNA damage-response genes and susceptibility to lung and head and neck cancers.,"Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for lung cancer, and together with alcohol for head and neck (H--N) cancer. These genotoxics produced DNA damage and particularly double-strand breaks (DSB) that are removed by various repair pathways. To understand the initiation of these cancers, we performed a genotype analysis to correlate some variants in specific genes in a case-control study of lung and H-N cancers. In a discovery phase, we sequenced DNA samples of 32 healthy Caucasians to describe genetic variants in 30 genes involved in the repair of DSB and in DNA damage response. 625 variants were detected on 29 out of the 30 genes successfully screened by sequencing exons, parts of introns and flanking regions. These included 470 non-exonic variants, from which 33 insertions/deletions, and 155 exonic alterations, corresponding to 59 non synonymous polymorphisms. 223 of these variants were not previously described. In total, 379 variants were successfully genotyped in a case-control study restricted to smokers including 151 lung cases, 251 H-N cases, and 172 controls. To account for multiple testing, we associated to each p-value a proportion of false positives (q-value). Haplotype-analysis suggested potential associations (p < 0.05) between lung cancer and 2 genes (RECQL4 and RAD52), which came with q-value of 8%, and between H-N cancer and 1 gene (DNA-PK) but with q-value of 56%. The 3 genes are key players for regulating the efficiency of DSB repair. Large-scale studies are needed to show if any of these 3 variants are truly associated with an increased risk of cancer."

CD008054,0,18714488,0,Side effect of head and neck radiotherapy: optic neuropathy.,"Therapeutic irradiation of the head and neck region for control of tumor growth and for palliation of tumor mass effect, as well as stereotactic surgery increased in use in recent years, having a wide applicability. Despite technological advances, radiation-induced optic neuropathy is serious complication of this kind of treatment. Very important is early recognition of the disorder and treatment in incipient phases. Radiation damage could be acute (appearing during radiotherapy), early-delayed (occurring within 3 months after initial exposure) and late-delayed delayed radionecrosis, within 6 months to 10 years after exposure). Theories of vascular occlusion, demyelination, free radical injury, direct damage to cellular DNA, damage to the blood-brain barrier have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology. Patients commonly presents with unexplained, painless visual loss in one or both eyes, visual field defects, pupillary abnormalities and defective color vision. For both detection and management an important tool is Magnetic Resonance Imaging with and without contrast agents. Systemic corticosteroids, hyperbaric oxygen therapy free-radical scavengers showed some efficiency in treatment, especially in acute phases. A promise in treatment shows intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injections and anti-VEGF molecules. But there is still no therapy that has been proven effective. The visual prognosis is poor, so we want to raise a alarm signal with this paper: awareness of this side-effect and mostly its prevention should be the way in managing patients who receive therapeutic irradiation for intracranial, sinus, nasopharyngeal, intraorbital and intraocular tumors."

CD008054,0,20173500,0,Endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus involving the cervix: some cases probably represent independent primaries.,"The majority of endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas involving the cervix have tumor morphology that is similar in the endometrium and the endocervix. There are, however, some cases in which the morphology of the tumor in the endocervix is different from the endometrial carcinoma, in which it is more invasive than the endometrial carcinoma, or in which invasion only occurs in the endocervix while there is no or only minimal myometrial invasion. The goal of this study was to investigate whether tumors involving the endometrium and the endocervix are similar or 2 independent primaries by hematoxylin and eosin stain, immunohistochemistry (IHC), human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in situ hybridization, RNA reverse transcriptase in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses to reveal HPV, and DNA clonality studies. We selected 14 cases of endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas involving the cervix with complete pathology material available from the years between 1968 and 2004. Immunohistochemical studies for vimentin, carcinoembryonic antigen, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and p16 were performed in 12 cases; HPV DNA/RNA analyses in 4 cases; and clonality studies in 9 cases. The patients' ages ranged from 42 to 81 years (mean: 62 y). Follow-up information was obtained in 11 patients. Histologic features varied between the tumors in the endometrium and the endocervix in 8 cases, and 5 of these cases had uniform, dilated glands having a microcystic appearance in the cervix. In 6 cases, the tumors in the endometrium and the endocervix had similar histologic features. The immunohistochemical studies showed some differences between the endometrial and endocervical adenocarcinomas in 8 of the 12 cases, independent of differing or similar histologic features. HPV testing in 4 of the cases (3 with similar and 1 with different histology) yielded similar results in the endometrium and endocervix: 2 cases were negative, 1 was positive and 1 was equivocal for HPV DNA/RNA analyses. Clonality studies showed differences between the adenocarcinoma in the endometrium and the endocervix in 7 cases, including 5 cases with different histologic appearances; 2 cases had similar loss of heterozygosity patterns. In conclusion, as suggested by clonality studies, coexisting endometrial and endocervical carcinomas with different histologic features are most likely independent neoplasms. Endometrial and endocervical carcinomas that have similar appearances can represent either the same neoplasm or independent primaries. Clonality tests may help determine their relationship. IHC studies may not be helpful for synchronous endometrial and endocervical tumors, especially those of endometrioid type. It is possible that IHC identifies cell differentiation, rather than site of origin. HPV studies are important to identify endocervical tumors associated with high-risk HPV. However, endometrial tumors involving the cervix and endocervical tumors unrelated to HPV are both negative for high-risk HPV."
CD008054,0,9041198,0,Integration of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA is linked to the down-regulation of class I human leukocyte antigens by steroid hormones in cervical tumor cells.,"A crucial event in the malignant progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia appears to be the up-regulation of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) early gene expression. Steroid hormones have been linked to the progression from premalignant to neoplastic status in HPV positive lesions. This report demonstrates that at physiological levels, the glucocorticoid hormone hydrocortisone consistently down-regulates class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) surface expression in HPV-positive cervical tumor cells but can up-regulate expression in HPV-negative epithelial tumor lines. Suppression of HLA expression was also seen with progesterone, another steroid hormone. The hydrocortisone-mediated modulation of HLA expression is dependent on integration and transcription of the HPV genome and can be blocked by Ru38486, an antagonist of both glucocorticoid and progesterone receptors, indicating the role of these receptors in mediating HLA suppression. The data suggest that HPV integration events in cervical epithelia correlate with hormone-dependent HLA suppression, possibly contributing to the avoidance of tumor recognition by cytotoxic T cells. These studies imply that clinical use of steroids may be contraindicated in HPV-positive individuals who have early premalignant cervical disease or neoplasia but provide evidence that the antiprogestin Ru38486 may be useful in the management of early stage cervical disease."
CD008054,0,8549609,0,Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and human papillomavirus related lesions of the genital tract in HIV positive and negative women.,"Two hundred and twenty one women at high risk for HIV (intravenous drug users and/or those with infected partners) were investigated, through a self-filled questionnaire and gynaecological examination, to define the relationship between genital Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infections, preneoplastic cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) and behavioural risk factors. In the 121 HIV positive women, 58 (47%) had HPV lesions at colposcopic and/or cytologic examination and, out of these 58, 23 (40%) had CIN 1, CIN 2 or CIN 3. Six out of the 16 cases with CIN 1 and CIN 2 (37%) followed-up showed a rapid progression of the lesion to CIN 3; in 3 women the interval was 6 months, in the other 3 about 12 months. Only 5 (7%) of the remaining 66 women without HPV lesions had a CIN lesion, with an obviously significant difference on comparison with HPV positive subjects. Sixty two women out of the 121 (52%) had a previous diagnosis of condylomata. In the 100 HIV negative women, 23 (23%) had HPV lesions and, among these 23, 6 (26%) had CIN 1, CIN 2 or CIN 3; 1 of them had rapid progression from CIN 1 to CIN 3 within a year. Only 5 (3%) without HPV infection showed any kind of CIN. 33 women out of 100 (33%) had a previous clinical history of condylomata. Our findings strongly suggest that HIV infection is associated with HPV lesions and that cervical cytological abnormalities develop in this situation. There is a need for short interval cytological and colposcopic follow-up for women at high risk of HIV infection."

The present study followed the natural history and long-term outcomes of HPV infection in a cohort of women by national health insurance care and data linkage without additional disturbance. The status of cervical HPV infection was determined in 1708 healthy women, aged 20-90 (median 43), enrolled from 10 hospitals in seven cities around the island country of Taiwan. Records of consecutive Pap smear results and cancer reports of 108 cytology-negative, HPV-positive and 1202 cytology- and HPV-negative women with no prior record of CC or abnormal cervical cytology were retrospectively analysed for a duration of up to 75 months (median 61 months). The cumulative incidences of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and in situ/invasive cancer in HPV-positive women were 5.6 and 3.7%, respectively, and those in HPV-negative women were 0.3 and 0%. After adjusting for other risk factors, HPV-positive subjects had 24.9 (95% CI: 7.0-108.3; P<0.0001) folds of risk of developing HSIL or above cervical neoplasia as compared to HPV-negative subjects, whereas risk for low-grade intraepithelial lesion and atypical squamous cytology was not increased. The study showed that women with a prevalent infection of high-risk HPV had a 4% cumulative risk for CC in 6 years, whereas those tested negative had little risk. The result supports an HPV test-orientated CC screening programme with intervals of at least 5 years."

CD008054,0,10867615,0,Specific detection and quantitation of SCC antigen 1 and SCC antigen 2 mRNAs by fluorescence-based asymmetric semi-nested reverse transcription PCR.,"Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) is expressed in normal squamous epithelia and malignant squamous cell tissues. The serum level of SCCA has been used to evaluate treatment efficacy, clinical course of disease, and recurrence. SCCA is produced by at least two genes (SCCA1 and SCCA2); both of them have been located on chromosome 18q21.3. It has been difficult to examine the expression levels of SCCA1 and SCCA2 mRNAs separately because of their high homology at nucleotide level. In the present study, asymmetric semi-nested reverse transcription PCR, based on the principle of fluorescence energy transfer, enabled to quantitate the copy numbers of both SCCA1 and SCCA2 mRNAs. Using this method, the expression levels of these mRNAs were evaluated in normal and malignant squamous tissues. The copy number of SCCA2 mRNA was higher in malignant tissues than in normal tissues, while those of SCCA1 mRNA did not significantly differ between normal and malignant tissues. These data indicate that specific quantitation of the expression level of SCCA2 mRNA may be useful for the diagnosis and management of patients with squamous cell carcinoma."

Follow-up of these patients is important to ensure successful treatment. The present study was undertaken to determine whether human papillomavirus (HPV) testing can be used to discriminate patients who will have recurrences from those who will not. It is composed of 26 patients who presented with recurrences of CIN and 22 patients who remained disease-free after treatment. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded cone biopsies of incident CIN 3, their corresponding follow-up Pap smears taken 3 months postoperatively, and their secondary cone biopsies of the recurrent lesions. The extracted DNA were then analyzed by PCR for the presence of HPV. The posttreatment cervical smears in the recurrent group had a (25/26) 96% HPV prevalence, while HPV DNA was not detectable in any of the 22 patients in the control group. The HPV types in both the initial and recurrent lesions correlated very well. This suggest that most recurrences are likely to be due to persisting lesions or subclinical HPV infections that had not been completely removed. Cytology alone was not sufficiently sensitive to discriminate the patients at risk for recurrences. It appears that HPV testing can be useful to monitor the therapeutic result."

CD008054,0,11588127,0,An association of cervical inflammation with high-grade cervical neoplasia in women infected with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV).,"Previous reports of genital conditions, such as nonspecific genital infection/sore or vaginal discharge associated with cervical cancer (L. A. Brinton et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. (Bethesda), 79: 23-30, 1987; C. J. Jones et al., Cancer Res., 50: 3657-3662, 1990), suggest a possible link between either genital tract inflammation or changes in bacteria flora consistent with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and cervical cancer. To test whether changes in vaginal bacterial flora or the degree of cervical inflammation are associated with women having a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection or with women infected with oncogenic HPV having high-grade cervical lesions (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or cancer), we conducted a case-control study of women <50 years old enrolled in the Costa Rican natural history study of HPV and cervical neoplasia. To test whether BV and inflammation were associated with HPV DNA positivity, Analysis 1 was restricted to women with no or mild (low-grade or equivocal) cytological abnormalities, and the degree of inflammation and Nugent score (a measure of BV) were compared between women infected (n = 220) and not infected (n = 130) with HPV. To test whether BV and inflammation were associated with high-grade lesions, Analysis 2 was restricted to women infected with oncogenic HPV, and the degree of inflammation and Nugent score were compared between women with (n = 95) and without (n = 158) high-grade cervical lesions. In Analysis 1, BV and cervical inflammation were not associated with HPV infection. In Analysis 2, BV was not associated with high-grade lesions. However, we found a marginally significant positive trend of increasing cervical inflammation associated with high-grade lesions in oncogenic HPV-infected women, (P(trend) = 0.05). Overt cervicitis was associated with a 1.9-fold increase in risk of high-grade lesions (95% confidence interval, 0.90-4.1). The results of this study suggest that cervical inflammation may be associated with high-grade lesions and may be a cofactor for high-grade cervical lesions in women infected with oncogenic HPV."

DNA contents were measured by flow cytometric analysis of archival paraffin blocks and were correlated with clinicopathological findings, tumour response and patient survival. Comparison of variables including treatment modality was performed for identification of significant prognostic factors. There were 28 diploid, 27 aneuploid tumours and the remaining six were questionable. All patients were followed-up for at least two years or until death. Aneuploid tumours had a significantly higher S-phase fraction (percentage S-phase) (p < 0.001). Neither ploidy nor percentage S-phase were found to have predictive value in tumour response or patient survival within the power of a sample size of 61. Twenty of the 27 (74 per cent) aneuploid tumours had a complete response (CR) whereas 19 out of 28 (68 per cent) diploid tumours achieved CR. Five-year survival by the Kaplan-Meier method was 33 per cent for both aneuploid and diploid tumours. However, nodal stage (N stage) was found to have significant predictive value in both tumour response and patient survival. The complete response for stage N0 patients was 96 per cent, N1 patients 61 per cent, N2 patients 60 per cent and 43 per cent for N3 patients (p < 0.002). Similarly, the five year survival for the N0 and N3 groups of patients was 53 per cent and 29 per cent respectively (p < 0.05)."

CD008054,0,17230525,0,High grade cervical lesions are caused preferentially by non-European variants of HPVs 16 and 18.,"The intratypic variability of HPVs 16 and 18 has been extensively studied and has been used as an important tool in epidemiological studies of viral transmission, persistence and progression to clinically relevant cervical lesions. Infections by non-European variants of HPVs 16 and 18 are associated with an increased risk for the development of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Our aim was to correlate the intratypic molecular variability of both HPV types and risk of persistent infection and lesion outcome in a cohort study conducted in Brazil. We characterized molecular variants of HPV types 16 and 18 by sequencing a fragment of the LCR, and of the E6 and L1 genes, for HPV-16 variants only. For both types, European variants composed the most prevalent and diverse group. Persistent infections with HPV-18 were associated with continuous detection of European variants. However, risk for simultaneous detection of HSIL and HPV DNA was higher in women harboring non-European variants of HPV-16. The same trend was observed with HSIL detected during follow-up. Our study confirms the association between non-European variants and risk of cervical neoplasia, and highlights the importance of their geographic distribution for cervical cancer risk assessment."

HPV testing is fundamentally different from conventional cytologic testing, because it evaluates the HPV infection itself, the most important causative factor for cervical cancer. In this study, the roles and clinical applications of HPV testing in cervical cancer screening are examined from 3 standpoints: in primary screening, in the management of women with low-grade cytologic abnormalities, and in the follow-up after treatment of pre-invasive or early invasive lesions."

To describe the occurrence of concurrent infection with multiple HPV types and to determine whether genital HPV infection modifies the risk of acquiring a new HPV infection with another HPV type, 1610 subjects were monitored for an average of 4.1 years in Bogota, Colombia. Information on risk factors for HPV infection and cervical cells was collected for detection of HPV DNA of 36 types at study entry and at 6 consecutive 6-month follow-up visits. Clustering or the concurrent acquisition of multiple types occurred more often than would be expected by chance. Subjects with incident HPV-16 or -18 infection had 5-7 times higher odds of acquiring a subsequent HPV-58 infection than subjects not infected with HPV-16 or -18. This might affect the protection conferred by effective HPV vaccines."
CD008054,0,15010819,0,The diagnostic utility of human papillomavirus-testing in combination with immunohistochemistry in advanced gynaecologic pelvic tumours: a new diagnostic approach.,"Gynaecologic pelvic tumours comprise a range of histological entities that are highly variable with respect to their clinical behaviour. The distinction of these tumours can be extremely difficult. Accurate identification of the primary tumour site has significant impact on the treatment strategy and prognosis. In this study we investigated the diagnostic and clinical utility of HPV (Human Papillomavirus)-testing in combination with selected immunohistochemical markers in advanced pelvic tumours of unknown primary origin. Specimens of eight patients who presented with advanced gynaecologic pelvic tumour of unknown primary origin, 10 unequivocal cervical carcinomas with 10 corresponding metastases and 10 unequivocal endometrial carcinomas with 4 corresponding metastases were studied. All cases were analysed for HPV-infection by PCR. The expression of CEA, vimentin (VIM), estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) was studied by immunohistochemistry. HPV-DNA was exclusively detected in cervical carcinomas and their corresponding metastases but in none of the endometrial carcinomas (Fisher's exact test p<0.001). Endometrial carcinomas and their metastases were generally positive for ER (86%), PR (93%) and VIM (100%) but rarely positive for CEA (14%) and HPV (0%). Most cervical carcinomas and their corresponding metastases were positive for CEA (79%) and HPV (89%). They rarely expressed ER (5%), PR (5%) and VIM (10%). Among the eight patients with unknown primary tumour four patients were diagnosed with a cervical carcinoma and four with an endometrial carcinoma. In one case we could exclude an ovarian carcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of selected markers in combination with HPV-testing is simple and inexpensive. The detection of HPV-DNA seems to provide the most compelling evidence for the primary tumour site, when immunohistochemical analysis is less definitive. The proposed diagnostic approach is helpful in the identification and management of pelvic tumours of unknown primary origin."

CD008054,0,16614679,0,Multifactorial etiology of cervical cancer: a hypothesis.,"Cancer of the cervix is the second most common life-threatening cancer among women worldwide, with incidence rates ranging from 4.8 per 100,000 women per year in the Middle East to 44.3 per 100,000 in East Africa. Epidemiologic and clinical data demonstrate that human papillomaviruses (HPV), especially HPV-16 and HPV-18, play at least a major if not a necessary role in the etiology of cervical cancer. However, many investigators acknowledge that HPV is not sufficient to induce cervical cancer and that a multifactorial etiology is likely. HPV can be found in a growing proportion of patients with cervical cancer, approaching 100%, but is not yet found in every patient with disease. Other factors, such as herpes simplex virus type 2 infections, cigarette smoking, vaginal douching, nutrition, and use of oral contraceptives, have been proposed as contributing factors. In the first half of the 20th century, Peyton Rous and colleagues demonstrated the joint action of tars and Shope papillomavirus to consistently induce squamous cell carcinomas in rabbits. Using the Rous model as a prototype, one might hypothesize that some cases of cervical cancer arise from an interaction between oncogenic viruses and cervical tar exposures. Cervical tar exposures include cigarette smoking, use of tar-based vaginal douches, and long years of inhaling smoke from wood- and coal-burning stoves in poorly ventilated kitchens."
CD008054,0,8876905,0,Oncological problems in AIDS--a review of the clinical features and management.,"Since the beginning of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic in the early 1980s, several malignant conditions have been recognised to be associated with this syndrome which affect up to 40% of AIDS patients at some stage of their illness. They include Kaposi's sarcoma, systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma and invasive cervical cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma and primary central nervous system lymphoma were tumours rarely seen below the age of 50 prior to the epidemic and therefore were recognised early to be AIDS-related conditions. However, systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and invasive cervical cancer were only recognised when sufficient epidemiological evidence became available to indicate an increased incidence of these conditions amongst the HIV-infected population. In the presence of immunosuppression, the biological behaviour of these conditions are significantly altered with a more advanced stage at presentation, a more aggressive disease course and poorer responses to treatment. There is evidence that in each of these malignant conditions, an additional viral infection may be responsible for their pathogenesis. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus is implicated in the development of Kaposi's sarcoma, Epstein-Barr virus in systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as primary central nervous system lymphoma and human papilloma virus in invasive cervical cancer. Developing effective treatment strategies with minimal toxicity for these patients remains the greatest challenge as they often have serious coexisting illnesses and tolerate chemotherapy poorly because of insufficient bone marrow function reserve."
CD008054,0,10554949,0,Outcome after a Pap smear report of low-grade abnormality: a longitudinal comparative study.,"The rate of subsequent diagnosis of high-grade cervical abnormality was studied among women whose first Pap smear in 1994 was reported as being negative or from the category of low-grade abnormality (excluding CIN 1). Regardless of the degree of low-grade abnormality reported on the entry smear, the rate of subsequent high-grade disease was 3.3 cases per 100 years of follow-up. The rate of subsequent high-grade disease among women with negative Pap smear reports was 0.23 to 0.45 cases per 100 years of follow-up. Within each cohort, a small number of cases of invasive cervical cancer were diagnosed in the 2 years after the entry smear. These data indicate that Pap smear reports which are coded to the registry squamous cell code of 'mild atypia' (with or without evidence of human papillomavirus effect) have a significantly higher risk of emerging high-grade cervical disease than negative Pap smear reports (including those with minor reactive and/or inflammatory change). It is suggested that the former have a uniform recommendation of repeating the smear in 1 year and the latter in 2 years."

This theoretical process is described as a labyrinth journey-an imperative healing process undertaken by all participants, who undertook the following tasks: evaluating peril, seeking refuge, obtaining information, and reframing their self-image. Women who also learned they were infected with the human papillomavirus faced a prolonged sense of threat to their sense of sexual well-being. Their additional tasks related to reevaluating their sexual self-image, and they continued to work on these reframing tasks throughout their 1st year's journey.

Therefore, these smears represent the only adequate sample for cervical cancer screening. In our study, a close concertation between biologists and clinicians results in an improvement of the smear quality. The percentage of those containing endocervical cells increased from 49% in 1987 to 72% in 1990. Then, more cervical lesions were encountered on smears of patients from a low socio-economic level. New techniques such as detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA on routine Pap smears by in situ hybridization would allow to improve the cytological diagnosis of HPV infections, mainly for non specific cytological alterations (11% in our series for 1990) and for cytological aspects of dysplasia only. These results point out how a cervical cancer screening can be better carried out."

CD008054,0,11563871,0,Human papillomavirus as a form of risk assessment.,"There is a huge amount of interest in the use of human papillomavirus testing to improve both the sensitivity and specificity of cervical screening. Although oncogenic human papillomavirus subtypes are recognized to be the most important factor in the development of cervical disease, only a minority of such infections results in invasive cancer. Given our current, albeit limited, knowledge of the natural history of human papillomavirus infection and the development of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia, it may be possible to identify well-defined high-risk groups of women. Such groups may benefit from intensive surveillance, or indeed new developments in immunoprophylaxis, while allowing low-risk women less screening intervention. Known high-risk groups include those with chronic immunosuppression and previous treatment for high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia. Lowering the upper age limit for cervical screening is already under consideration because of the low incidence of both human papillomavirus infection and cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia in older women, and human papillomavirus testing could rationalize the screening programme."
CD008054,0,7677687,0,High long-term cure rate justifies routine treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I.,"The long-term clearance of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) Grade 1 after one treatment was studied retrospectively in 105 patients. Treatment was by CO2 laser vaporization (74 patients), cone biopsy (8), loop electroexcision (LEEP) (7), electrodiathermy (1) and hysterectomy (2); 79 of the 92 treated patients (85.9%) had normal cervical cytology and colposcopy on a mean follow-up period of 36.7 months (95% confidence interval between 33.1-40.4 months). Life table analysis showed that the probability of the cervix remaining disease free was 81% at 72 months of follow-up. Of the 13 patients with a cervical abnormality after the initial treatment, 4 had persistent CIN 1, 3 persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, 2 recurrent CIN 1 and 4 had recurrent HPV infection. In contrast, of the 13 untreated patients with CIN 1, 7 (53.8%) continued to demonstrate an abnormality on the cervix after a mean follow-up period of 27.5 months (95% confidence interval between 18.8 and 36.3 months). No significant perioperative morbidity was recorded in the treated patients. The results of this study suggest that CIN 1 can be effectively eradicated in more than 80% of women with 1 treatment alone. The treatment should be considered for all these patients to spare them the psychological and emotional trauma of having to face repeated abnormal cervical cytology on follow up."

CD008054,0,7677684,0,A cohort study comparing the detection of HPV DNA from women who stop and continue to smoke.,"The objective of this study was to compare the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in women who stopped smoking, and those who continued to smoke. Women entering a smoking cessation programme had tampon specimens collected and analyzed for HPV DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (L1 consensus primers). Women with HPV DNA in their initial specimens had follow-up specimens collected 1 year later. The stored initial specimens were reanalyzed in the same experiment with the follow-up specimen. In addition, Hybrid Capture and quantitative PCR were used to determine if the change in HPV DNA over the year of follow-up was greater in either group. Of 197 women who were recruited into the study, 57 (29%) were positive for HPV DNA. Second specimens were obtained from 49 of these 57 women. Of these 49 women, 13 had stopped smoking and 36 continued to smoke. The detection of HPV DNA in follow-up specimens was not significantly different in the women who stopped smoking (54%) compared to those who continued to smoke (50%, p = 0.81). Furthermore, the change in the amount of HPV DNA during follow-up was not different in women who stopped smoking compared to women who continued to smoke (p > 0.25). This study suggests that smoking cessation does not affect the detection of genital HPV DNA. On the basis of these findings it is likely that smoking does not increase the risk of invasive cervical cancer by prolonging the detection of HPV DNA."
CD008054,0,17961877,0,Potential effects of decreased cervical cancer screening participation after HPV vaccination: an example from the U.S.,"A concern with widespread implementation of HPV vaccination programs is that women may mistakenly decide that they do not need to be screened any longer, and thus be less likely to participate in cervical cancer screening, because they view themselves to be at low-risk of developing cervical cancer. We hypothesized that non-participation in screening among vaccinated young women in the 5 years following vaccination may result in missed CIN 2-3 cases that could progress to cancer. For instance, if 50% fewer women 26-30 years old, who were vaccinated, participate in screening in the United States over a 5 year time horizon, there would be approximately 4 women (per 1000) with missed CIN 2-3. On the other hand, non-participation will reduce the number of false-positive screening test results, as non-participation would avoid approximately 27 false-positive test results, with a decrease in follow-up procedures and costs. These results highlight the importance of educating women to ensure continued screening, as well as the need to consider new approaches to screening in the era of vaccination."

CD008054,0,12170526,0,"Human papillomaviruses. Applications, caveats and prevention.","Unlike cervical cytology, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing provides an objective assessment of neoplasia risk. The major advantages of this technology are the potential for ""reflex testing"" (when used with liquid-based cytology); efficient exclusion of HPV-negative women, who can be triaged to yearly follow-up; and identification of HPV-positive women, who require colposcopic triage. However, practitioners should be aware that highly sensitive HPV tests will also identify many women with little or no immediate risk of significant neoplasia, may impose a psychosocial burden on the patient and may be used or interpreted inappropriately by both practitioners and patients. However, these caveats are similar to those inherent in any screening program involving a sexually transmitted disease, and the disadvantages of HPV testing will be minimized by attention to patient concerns and a keen awareness of the limitations of this technology. Ultimately, control of cervical cancer and its precursors rests with active prevention via vaccination programs targeting HPV. If successful, such programs could radically alter the number of women requiring triage for preinvasive disease and initiate a progressive decline in cervical cancer incidence."

CD008054,0,20302962,0,Time to consider HPV vaccination after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is among the most common secondary cancers after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Several types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are causally linked with SCC of the genital tract and head and neck, and the incidence of these cancers is higher among immunosuppressed patients compared to immunocompetent patients. In June 2006, a quadrivalent HPV vaccine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for females aged 9 to 26 years to prevent cervical warts and vulvar, vaginal, and cervical cancer. FDA approval was granted in October 2009 for males aged 9 to 26 years to prevent genital warts. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is now available for off-label use, and may be beneficial to patients after allo-SCT. It is time to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy in preventing HPV-related squamous cell carcinoma in this population."
CD008054,0,15630792,0,Efficacy and other milestones for human papillomavirus vaccine introduction.,"Last year, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened a gathering of experts, including scientists, national regulatory authorities, industry representatives, epidemiologists and government officials from both developed and developing countries to discuss appropriate endpoint measurements for HPV vaccine efficacy and effectiveness trials. The consultation also considered the regulatory requirements and public health issues that vaccine candidates should address before deployment, particularly in developing countries. This report summarizes the discussions and the conclusions reached over the course of the consultation. The general consensus of the consultation was that it would be desirable to have a globally-agreed, measurable efficacy endpoint for considering deployment of HPV vaccines in public health settings. After hearing from experts about virological and clinical endpoints to be considered, requirements of regulatory authorities of various countries and endpoints used to measure efficacy and effectiveness for another known cancer vaccine (hepatitis B), the experts agreed that ethical and time considerations make it necessary to use a surrogate endpoint, and not invasive cervical cancer, to define efficacy of HPV vaccines. While regulatory authorities of each country ultimately will determine the endpoints required for licensure, the consultation recommended that the endpoint for efficacy in population-based studies be, based on current knowledge, histologically-classified cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) of moderate or high-grade, as well as cancer. Since persistent infection with the same high-risk type is considered a predictor for moderate or high-grade cervical dysplasias and cancer, they might represent a useful endpoint in future vaccine efficacy studies. Indeed, if vaccines prove to be effective against transient or persistent HPV infections, it is likely that they will protect women against cervical cancer. The consultation recognized that in the context of many developing countries, efficacy alone might not provide enough information for countries to decide whether or not to adopt HPV vaccines as a public health prevention tool against cervical cancer. The consultation unanimously agreed that additional clinical bridging studies as well as studies to clarify local epidemiology should be conducted in certain developing countries to determine the potential impact of vaccination. Such countries should also undertake targeted interventions to ensure acceptability and programmatic feasibility of the vaccination. Recognizing that upon vaccine introduction it will be some years before a reduction in cervical cancer is detectable at the population level, the consultation stressed the importance of maintaining existing cervical screening programmes while such long-term studies are conducted. The following paper explains the background and rationale behind these conclusions and elaborates on specific considerations for vaccine study and introduction in developing countries."

A total of 227 women cytologically normal and HPV positive at baseline were identified from a population-based cohort of 1,995 Bogota, Colombia, women aged 13-85 years followed between 1993 and 2000 (mean follow-up, 5.3 years). HPV DNA detection and viral load determination were based on a GP5+/GP6+ polymerase chain reaction enzyme immunoassay. Rate ratio estimates for HPV clearance were calculated by using methods for interval-censored survival time data. Analyses were based on 316 type-specific HPV infections. HPV 16 had a significantly lower clearance rate than infections with low-risk types (rate ratio (RR) = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.32, 0.72), HPV types related to HPV 16 (types 31, 33, 35, 52, 58) had intermediate clearance rates (RR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.94), and other high-risk types did not show evidence of slower clearance compared with low-risk types. Infections with single and multiple HPV types had similar clearance rates. There was no evidence of a dose-response relation between clearance and viral load. Observed was slower clearance in parous women (RR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.89) and faster clearance in ever users of oral contraceptives (RR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.77)."

CD008054,0,18425044,0,BD ProEx C: a sensitive and specific marker of HPV-associated squamous lesions of the cervix.,"BD ProEx C (ProEx C) is a recently developed immunocytochemical assay that targets the expression of topoisomerase II-alpha and minichromosome maintenance protein-2, 2 genes shown to be overexpressed in cervical cancers. Recent studies validated this reagent in liquid-based cytology specimens and suggested its usefulness as an adjunct in the diagnosis of challenging cases. Limited information is available on its expression in tissue sections. This study aims to assess ProEx C expression patterns in benign, atypical, and dysplastic lesions of the cervix and to compare these patterns with p16 and Ki67 expression and with the presence of human papilloma virus DNA as determined by in situ hybridization. ProEx C positivity was limited to the basal layers of the epithelium in 75% of benign cervices. In the remaining 25%, staining extended into the lower half of the epithelium particularly in areas of squamous metaplasia and immature squamous metaplasia. In 92% of high-grade dysplasias [cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II and III] strong positive staining for ProEx C involved the lower and upper halves of the epithelium. Condylomas and CIN I showed greater variability in staining pattern with ProEx C positivity extending into the upper half of the epithelium in 48% of cases. Statistically significant correlations were noted with presence of human papilloma virus DNA and with p16/Ki67 expression. Atypical squamous metaplasia showed varied staining with 24% being positive. To summarize, ProEx C is a reliable marker for high-grade CIN that can be applied to tissue sections to confirm the diagnosis of high-grade CIN and to triage cases of atypical squamous metaplasia. ProEx C may also have a potential role in triaging patients with low-grade CIN. ProEx C expression patterns are similar to those for p16 and Ki67 with most discrepancies occurring in the CIN I category."
CD008054,0,19585576,0,Mortality in a long-term follow-up after treatment of CIN.,"After treatment of the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) cervical cancer incidence remains elevated at least for 20 years. Whether the overall or cervical cancer mortality after treatment of CIN is elevated is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the long-term survival and cause-specific mortality among women treated for CIN. The study population consisted of 7,104 women treated for CIN between 1974 and 2001 and 35,437 individually matched controls. The follow-up of mortality was based on nationwide registries and closed at death, emigration or December 31, 2005. The possible differences in mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazard model. With follow-up time of approximately 630,000 woman-years, overall 2,781 deaths were observed, 530 among women treated for CIN and 2,251 among reference population (HR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.3). Mortality from any cancer (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7), lung cancer (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.8-4.1) and HPV-related anogenital cancer (HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1-8.6) was higher among CIN patients, but mortality from cervical cancer was not (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.3-4.0). Elevated cervical cancer incidence after treatment of CIN, documented earlier, did not predict elevation in cervical cancer mortality. This suggests high effectiveness of CIN management. Most of the excess mortality observed among CIN patients was due to increased risk of other cancers. These long-term mortality patterns should be considered when planning and evaluating the management of CIN lesions and related cervical or other cancer prevention activity."

However, solitary fibrous tumors arising from somatic soft tissue occur only rarely and can pose problems in the differential diagnosis from other benign or malignant soft tissue tumors. The majority of solitary fibrous tumors occurring in the somatic soft tissue have been found in the extremities and limb girdles, and the head and neck regions. There have been only eight published cases located in the abdominal wall. We herein report two female patients who developed solitary fibrous tumors of the abdominal wall that were not in association with the underlying peritoneum. Histologically, both tumors were characterized by a variety of architectural patterns, alternating hypercellular and hypocellular areas, proliferation of plump spindle cells, thick keloid-like and/or amianthoid collagen bundles, and ectatic staghorn-like vessels. Both tumors showed a diffuse strong reaction for CD34 and vimentin as well as focal positivity for bcl-2 and smooth muscle actin. A striking predominance in females was found in a literature review of solitary fibrous tumors of the abdominal wall, contrasting with other somatic soft tissue sites which show an equal gender distribution. Interestingly, expression of estrogen but not progesterone receptor was observed in both tumors. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells displayed features of fibroblasts with dilated branching rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and Golgi apparatus. Both tumors assayed by flow cytometry demonstrated a diploid DNA content with an S-phase fraction of 7.9% and 11.4%, respectively. At follow up, both patients were well without evidence of recurrence or metastasis after surgical excision."
CD008054,0,19954820,1,Papillary squamous intraepithelial lesions of the uterine cervix: human papillomavirus-dependent changes in cell cycle expression and cytologic features.,"Most human papillomavirus-associated squamous intraepithelial lesions of the uterine cervix are flat; some have papillary architecture that shows a spectrum of differentiation from low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. For this subset of lesions, there are few data relating human papillomavirus type to cytology and cell cycle activity. Here, we collected 24 cases of papillary squamous intraepithelial lesions with either low-risk (15 cases) or high-risk (9 cases) human papillomavirus infection. We described their morphology and performed immunohistochemical staining with cell cycle-related markers Ki-67, p53, pRb, and P16INK4a. The Ki-67 labeling index was significantly lower in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group (P < .001). A cut point of less than 50% labeling index detected all but one low-risk group case. Degradation of p53 and pRb was less evident in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group (p53, P < .001; pRb, P = .006). P16INK4a produced an unexpectedly high positive rate of staining in the low-risk group (60%). However, a specific top-heavy distribution pattern was noted, with evident nuclear but faint cytoplasmic staining, whereas the high-risk group showed strong full-thickness nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. The detection of these lesions by smear examination was not reliable, given the wide expression pattern. Papillary structure was evident in none. We conclude that cell cycle-related markers are helpful in distinguishing low- and high-risk lesions. The strong p16INK4a staining in the low-risk group may imply that more cell cycle-controlling pressure is elicited in papillary lesions than in flat lesions. The distribution pattern of p16INK4a staining is important when making a diagnosis; cytology is not effective. Human papillomavirus type, histology, and cell cycle markers could clearly separate these lesions into either a low-risk or a high-risk group, properly designated low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in current management algorithms. Thus, the previously used terms papillary immature metaplasia and immature condyloma, although descriptive for low-risk group lesions, are confusing and should be discarded."

Of all cases of CIN, 38% were diagnosed to have low grade abnormalities, 6.8% had high-grade abnormalities. The predictive rate of colposcopy in identifying low-grade abnormalities was approximately 60% and 80.7% had a normal smear after 6 months, follow-up. As cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was found in a significant number of patients, borderline changes in cervical smears need subsequent evaluation. Even though more than two-thirds of women had negative smears at 6-month follow-up, the study recommends annual follow-up smears for several years as the long-term risk is not definitely known."

A case report.,"The following case report demonstrates the clinical use of cervicography as an adjunct test to identify premalignant or malignant cervical disease. An asymptomatic woman seeking routine health maintenance care was screened by serial Papanicolaou (Pap) smears and cervicography. The interval Pap smears were interpreted as satisfactory and within normal limits; however, the cervigrams were interpreted sequentially as atypical and positive. A subsequent cervical biopsy revealed carcinoma in situ.

CD008054,0,12814991,0,The natural history of type-specific human papillomavirus infections in female university students.,"Little is known about the average duration of type-specific human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and their patterns of persistence. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the rate of acquisition and clearance of specific HPV types in young women. Female university students (n = 621) in Montreal were followed for 24 months at 6-month intervals. At each visit, a cervical specimen was collected. HPV DNA was detected using the MY09/MY11 PCR protocol followed by typing for 27 HPV genotypes by a line blot assay. The Kaplan-Meier technique was used to estimate the cumulative probability of acquiring or clearing a HPV infection considering types individually or in high-risk (HR) or low-risk (LR) groups defined by oncogenic potential. Incidence rates were 14.0 cases/1000 women-months (95% confidence interval, 11.4-16.3) and 12.4 cases/1000 women-months (95% confidence interval, 10.4-14.8) for acquiring HR and LR HPV infections, respectively. The 24-month cumulative rates of acquisition were highest for HPV-16 (12%), HPV-51, and HPV-84 (8%). Of the incident infections, HPV-16 was the most persistent (mean duration, 18.3 months), followed by HPV-31 and HPV-53 (14.6 and 14.8 months, respectively). HPV-6 and HPV-84 had the shortest mean duration time (<10 months) The mean durations of incident, same-type LR or HR HPV infections were 13.4 months and 16.3 months, respectively. Whereas the majority of episodes with a type-specific HPV infection cleared within 2 years, there were many women who were either reinfected with a new HPV genotype or presumably experienced reactivation of their initial infection."

CD008054,0,11809677,0,Aberrant promoter methylation of multiple genes in bronchial brush samples from former cigarette smokers.,"Promoter hypermethylation plays an important role in the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes during tumorigenesis. Recent data suggest that such epigenetic abnormality may occur very early in lung carcinogenesis. To determine the extent of promoter hypermethylation in early lung tumorigenesis, we analyzed promoter methylation status of the p16, death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) and glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) genes using methylation-specific PCR in bronchial brush samples obtained from 100 former smokers enrolled in a chemoprevention clinical trial. We found that 17% of the samples showed methylation for p16 and 17% the same for DAPK, whereas only 6% of the samples displayed methylation for GSTP1. A total of 32% of the samples had methylation in at least one of the three genes tested, and 8% of the samples had methylation in two genes. The methylation status of p16 was correlated with that of DAPK (P = 0.04, Fisher's exact test). p16 methylation was higher in former smokers with a history of previous cancer than in former smokers without a history of cancer (P = 0.04, Fisher's exact test), and methylation of DAPK was detected more frequently in older patients than it was in younger patients (P = 0.01, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Surprisingly, no correlation was found between methylation in any of these genes and the smoking characteristics of the individuals analyzed (packs per day, pack-years, smoking years, quitting years). The precise meaning of methylated genes in the bronchial brush samples of former smokers must be sought by means of careful follow-up of these individuals."

Evidence-based cytology (EBC) is an offshoot of EBM. The EBC is concerned with generating a reproducible, high quality and clinically relevant test result in the field of cytology. This is a rapidly evolving area with high practical importance. EBC is based entirely on research data. The various professional bodies on cytology design and recommend guidelines on the basis of evidences. Once the guideline is implemented and practiced then the experiences of the practicing cytopathologists may be used as a feed back to alter the existing guideline. The various facets of EBC are sampling and specimen adequacy, morphological identification and computer based expert system, integrated reporting, identification of the controversial areas and high quality researches for evidences. It is the duty of the individuals and institutions to practice EBC for better diagnosis and management of the patients. In this present paper, the various aspects of EBC have been discussed."
CD008054,0,15144570,0,IL-10 promoter nt -1082A/G polymorphism and human papillomavirus infection in cytologic abnormalities of the uterine cervix.,"The role of A/G polymorphism at nucleotide -1082 in the interleukin-10 (IL-10) promoter was assessed by following the disease course of 253 patients who had had a routine diagnostic Hybrid Capture human papillomavirus (HPV) test because of cytologic or colposcopic abnormalities of the uterine cervix. At baseline, 97 (78%) of the 125 high-risk HPV-positive and 83 (65%) of the 128 HPV-negative patients had equivocal cytologic atypia classified as P3 by the Papanicolaou classification, and the rest of the patients had mild colposcopic atypia with cytologic results of no oncogenic significance. In the high-risk HPV-infected patients, the frequency distribution of the nt -1082 genotypes (A/A: 28%; A/G: 52%; G/G: 20%) did not differ significantly from that in the controls (A/A: 25%; A/G: 51%; G/G: 24%; p = 0.70). On the other hand, the nt -1082 G allele tended to decrease susceptibility to equivocal cytologic atypia unrelated to HPV infection (A/G: OR = 0.56 [95% CI: 0.31-1.02], G/G: OR = 0.27 [95% CI: 0.11-0.63], p for trend = 0.05). With respect to the development of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), the established risk factors, such as high-risk HPV infection (RR = 104.6, 95% CI: 14.2-769.9) and cytologic atypia (RR = 9.6, 95% CI: 2.34-39.7) but not the various nt -1082 genotypes (A/A: reference; A/G: RR = 1.11 [95% CI: 0.59-2.08]; G/G: RR = 0.62 [95% CI: 0.25-1.50]) were found to increase the risk for high-grade CIN. In conclusion, the nt -1082 polymorphism had no influence on the early phase of cervical carcinogenesis but may determine different susceptibilities to cervical abnormalities unrelated to HPV infection."

We report the clinicopathologic features of 10 tumors comprised of both typical low-grade adenoid basal tumors (epitheliomas) intimately associated with invasive carcinomas having infiltrative growth, increased cytological atypia and mitotic activity, and various types of differentiation, including adenoid basal/squamous, pure squamous, adenoid cystic, and small cell neuroendocrine. Tumors were evaluated for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA and immunohistochemical p16 expression. The patients in the study group ranged in age from 45 to 81 years (mean, 65 years). Most of the patients presented with abnormal cervicovaginal smears. The initial diagnosis was made on specimens obtained by cervical biopsy, laser electrocautery excision procedure (LEEP), or cone biopsy in 8 patients. Two 2 patients were incidentally diagnosed in hysterectomy specimens. All 10 patients had squamous intraepithelial lesions (9 high-grade, 1 low-grade). In all cases diagnosed in LEEP or cone biopsy specimens, the invasive carcinoma component was present in the excisional specimen and extended to the margins. Seven patients diagnosed on excisional or biopsy specimens who underwent hysterectomy had residual tumor in the cervix, ranging from microscopic foci to deeply invasive. No lymph node metastases were identified in 4 patients who were staged. Seven patients with follow-up were alive without evidence of disease after follow-up intervals of 8 to 84 months (mean, 45 months; median, 29 months). One patient with a component of small cell carcinoma died of other causes without evidence of disease at 18 months. HPV 16 DNA was detected in both the adenoid basal epithelioma and invasive carcinoma components in 9 tumors by in situ hybridization, and HPV 33 was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 1 tumor. All tumors expressed p16 diffusely. Adenoid basal tumors are high-risk HPV-related tumors that can be comprised of both a low-grade adenoid basal tumor, which can be designated as epithelioma, and invasive carcinomas of various types. The invasive component is usually evident in the excisional biopsy specimen, allowing for recognition of a tumor that needs further management."

CD008054,0,12385010,0,The role of genotype-specific human papillomavirus detection in diagnosing residual cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"We assessed prospectively whether residual cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) after treatment for high-grade CIN can be predicted by genotype-specific high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) detection in follow-up cervical scrapes. A broad spectrum, highly sensitive SPF(10)-LiPA-PCR HPV detection technique was used on cervical scrapes before large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ), on the LLETZ biopsy and on follow-up scrapes of 90 patients treated for high-grade CIN. HR-HPV was detected in the biopsies of 93% (n = 84) of the patients and in the follow-up scrapes of 48% (n = 43) of the patients. In 12 patients, genotype-specific HR-HPV persistence was detected in both follow-up scrapes. In 10 patients, residual CIN was detected. In 5 of these patients (including all patients with residual CIN 3), the follow-up scrapes showed genotype-specific HR-HPV persistence. In 2 patients, a different HR-HPV was detected, and 3 patients had HR-HPV-negative follow-up scrapes. Conventional cytologic follow-up was abnormal in 13 patients including all 10 patients with residual CIN. The negative predictive value (NPV) of HR-HPV detection on follow-up scrapes was high (94%). Repeat detection of genotype-specific HR-HPV showed a lower sensitivity and NPV than repeat detection of any HR-HPV, but its specificity was higher. Repeat conventional cytologic follow-up showed the highest sensitivity and NPV. In conclusion, the presence of HR-HPV in cervical scrapes after LLETZ for high-grade CIN is a risk factor for the presence of residual CIN. HR-HPV genotype-specific persistence is specifically present in patients with residual CIN 3. However, HR-HPV detection cannot predict or exclude the presence of residual CIN in the individual patient and additional procedures remain necessary."

CD008054,0,8389112,0,Behavior of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) associated with various human papillomavirus (HPV) types.,"201 cervical punch biopsies which showed CIN lesions and were obtained between 1967 to 1977 from Falu Hospital patients, with long-term follow-up data were examined histologically and by DNA typing for human papillomavirus (HPV). We used in situ hybridization for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31 and 33 and related our findings to the behaviour of the lesion (103 regressed spontaneously and 98 progressed, some of them to invasive cervical carcinoma). There was evidence of HPV infection in 75.6% (152/201) of these lesions on histological examination, and in 53.2% (107/201) on in situ DNA hybridization. Lesions positive for HPV by both methods occurred in the younger age group (Pearson's correlation coefficient, P = 0.008). HPV 16 was found in 51/152 (33.6%) of the HPV lesions, HPV in 12.5%, and HPV 33 in 8.5% HPV 16 was highly significantly (P = 0.0001), and HPV 18 and HPV 33 were significantly (P = 0.008 and P = 0.007, respectively) associated with increasing grades of CIN. Progression to invasive carcinoma was directly (and regression inversely) correlated with the severity of CIN in the first biopsy (P = 0.005). Almost 74% (17/23) of the HPV-CIN III lesions progressed, while only 25% of the HPV-NCIN lesions (6/24) did so. The progression rate was 84.6% for HPV 33 lesions and 52.9% for HPV 16. On the other hand, progression was less common with HPV 6 (25%), and HPV 31 (30.0%). Histological grade and HPV type appear to be of value as prognostic indices."

In this study various commercially available techniques for the detection of HPV were evaluated. HPV-status was determined in 86 samples of cervical cancer by PCR and direct sequencing, catalyzed signal amplified colorimetric DNA in situ hybridization (CSAC- ISH) (GenPoint system, DAKO), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in 12 selected cases also by conventional, non-amplified ISH. Twenty-one samples of cervical intraepithelial neoplasias grade III (CIN III) were investigated by CSAC-ISH, conventional ISH and by IHC, in corresponding PAP smears HPV-detection and typing was performed by CSAC-ISH and Hybrid Capture test II (HC). In additional 20 PAP smears HPV typing was performed using HC and a novel immunocytochemical system for HPV detection and-typing. CSAC-ISH showed good correlation with PCR analysis in cervical cancers: In 87% of PCR positive cases, HPV infection was also detected by CSAC- ISH (66/76). HPV 16 was detected in 75% of PCR-positive cases (44/59), HPV 18 in 71% of PCR positive cases (5/7). CSAC-ISH detected HPV 31 in only 29% of PCR positive cases (2/7), and HPV 33 in 64% of PCR-positive cases (23/36). Nevertheless, CSAC-ISH- false negative cases for HPV 31 or 33 were nearly always combined infections with other HPV types, which were detectable by CSAC-ISH in most cases. CSAC-ISH revealed HPV infection in 20 of 21 HC-positive cervical smears, while in corresponding biopsies (CIN III) CSAC-ISH detected 100% of HPV infections. Conventional, non-amplified ISH showed significantly lower sensitivity compared with CSAC-ISH, and immunocyto- and -histochemistry were of very low sensitivity for detection of HPV. CSAC-ISH is an easy-to-handle method for detection and typing of cervical HPV infection, and shows sufficient sensitivity for clinical practice."

HIV antibody status was determined by ELISA of oral mucosal specimens, and HPV DNA in the genital tract was identified by hybridization of cervical scrapes with probe B of Hybrid Capture II. Among the 466 women investigated, the prevalence of HPV, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL) and high-grade SIL (HGSIL) were 47.2%, 13.9% and 12%. Fifty-three and one-half percent of the women were HIV-seropositive. As compared with HIV-seronegative women, HIV-infected women had a greater than 2-fold HPV prevalence (64.3% vs. 27.6%), a greater than 7-fold amount of HPV DNA (RLU of 82.6 vs. 10.7) in HPV(+) women assessed as normal on the reference standard, and a nearly 3-fold greater HGSIL prevalence (17.3% vs. 5.9%). The strong link between HGSIL and HPV DNA positivity was seen in both HIV-infected and HIV-seronegative women. The amount of HPV DNA increased with disease severity in both HIV-seronegative and HIV-infected women. The sensitivity and specificity of the HPV test for HGSIL were, respectively, 90.7% (95% confidence limit 77.9-97.4%) and 41.3% (34.5-48.3%) in HIV-infected women and 61.5% (31.6-86.1%) and 74.5% (68.0-80.3%), respectively, in HIV(-) women.

CD008054,0,7603721,0,Presence of human papillomavirus predicts recurrence of inverted papilloma.,"Recent evidence suggests that human papillomavirus may play a role in the pathogenesis of inverted papilloma, a benign but locally aggressive neoplasm with a high recurrence rate and an association with squamous cell carcinoma. Histologic features of inverted papilloma have not been useful in discriminating lesions at high risk for recurrence. We studied archival pathology specimens from 32 patients with inverted papilloma treated at the University of Michigan between 1980 and 1994 with polymerase chain reaction techniques and human papillomavirus E6 and L1 consensus primers. Twenty (63%) specimens tested positive for human papillomavirus. The clinical status of the remaining 25 patients was reviewed after seven patients with recent diagnosis or who were lost to follow-up were excluded. A significant association was identified between the presence of human papillomavirus DNA in inverted papilloma and recurrence after surgical excision. Thirteen of 15 patients whose tumors tested positive for HPV recurred, whereas none of the 10 patients whose tumors were human papillomavirus negative recurred (p < 0.00002). This strongly suggests that the presence of human papillomavirus predicts recurrence of inverted papilloma."

CD008054,0,18579716,0,Human papillomavirus genotype specificity of hybrid capture 2.,"Hybrid Capture 2 (hc2), a clinical test for carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, has proven to be a sensitive but only modestly specific predictor of cervical precancer and cancer risk. Some of its nonspecificity for clinical end points can be ascribed to cross-reactivity with noncarcinogenic HPV genotypes. However, the reference genotyping tests that have been used for these comparisons are also imperfect. We therefore sought to describe further the HPV genotype specificity of hc2 by comparing the hc2 results to paired results from two related PGMY09/11 L1 primer-based HPV genotyping assays: Linear Array (LA) and its prototype predecessor, the line blot assay (LBA). LA and LBA results were considered separately and combined (detection by either assay or both assays) for 37 individual HPV genotypes and HPV risk group categories (carcinogenic HPV > noncarcinogenic HPV > negative). Baseline specimens from 3,179 of 3,488 (91.5%) women referred to ALTS (a clinical trial to evaluate the management strategies for women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS] or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions) because of an ASCUS Papanicolaou smear were tested by all three assays. Among single-genotype infections with genotypes targeted by hc2 as detected by either PCR assay, HPV genotype 35 (HPV35) (86.4%), HPV56 (84.2%), and HPV58 (76.9%) were the most likely to test positive by hc2. Among single-genotype infections with genotypes not targeted by hc2 as detected by either assay, HPV82 (80.0%), HPV66 (60.0%) (recently classified as carcinogenic), HPV70 (59.1%), and HPV67 (56.3%) were the most likely to test positive by hc2. Among women who tested negative for carcinogenic HPV by both PCR tests and were positive for noncarcinogenic HPV by either test, 28% of women were hc2 positive. Conversely, 7.8% of all hc2-positive results in this population were due to cross-reactivity of hc2 with untargeted, noncarcinogenic HPV genotypes. In conclusion, hc2 cross-reacts with certain untargeted, noncarcinogenic HPV genotypes that are phylogenetically related to the targeted genotypes, but the degree of cross-reactivity may be less than previously reported."

The women treated for a CIN2-3 are more likely to develop invasive cancer and the risk is two to five times greater than that of the general population. The main objective of the follow-up of patients treated for high-grade CIN is in one hand, to detect and treat the recurrences and on the other hand, to determine a subpopulation presenting a high risk of recurrence which should be followed-up more intensively. At present, frequent follow-up with cytology and colposcopic evaluation of the cervix is the preferred strategy recommended in France by Anaes. Both, the cytology and the colposcopy don't have a very good sensitivity. HPV test is more sensitive compared to cytology or colposcopy in detecting CIN treatment failures. It would be more prudent to use a strategy involving both the cytology and HPV test. Both the sensitivity and the negative predictive value of combined cytology and HPV testing in detecting a residual disease or recurrence are around 100%. Women presenting negative results of both tests, could, then be considered at a low risk of recurrence and their surveillance should be the same as that of the screening of the general population. In case of positivity a more intensive follow-up should be organized."

The primary treatment group consisted of 24 patients who had the initial diagnosis made or confirmed at our institution, and the other 8 patients formed the salvage group. There were 23 men and 9 women. The median age in the primary treatment group was 63 years (range 18 to 91 years). The overall median survival among the primary group patients was 4.8 years, and the 3-year survival was estimated to be 57% (95% confidence interval 39% to 84%). The median follow-up was 2.1 years (range 83 days to 9.7 years). Patients who had tumors less than 7.0 cm in diameter and tumors with invasion only to the subcutaneous tissues had better overall survival and longer time to first adverse event. Diploid DNA content was a significant favorable prognostic factor for time to first adverse event. Mitotic activity was of borderline significance with both end points. Patients who had tumors of less than 1.5 cm were treated successfully with surgery alone. Patients treated with combined surgery and radiotherapy also tended to do better. Because most patients in whom regional recurrences developed had tumors larger than 7.0 cm, we conclude that patients with tumors of this size may benefit from regional neck node dissection at the time of primary excision or from elective neck irradiation."

HAART shows limited benefit on the incidence of high grade intraepithelial lesions and cancer in cervix, vulva and anus. On the other hand, it seems to raise discretely the spontaneous regression rates of cervical low grade lesions -cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade I- and condylomas, as well as the regression after treatment of CIN II-III. The benefit of HAART in squamous intraepithelial lesion seems to be modest, mostly due to the improvement of the immune status. The usefulness of DNA-HPV in HIV is not well established. HPV vaccines represent a mid-term new possibility of prevention for these lesions according to the high effectiveness shown in clinical trials, although the lack of data about effectiveness and security in HIV patients restrict its application. Second generation vaccines, still to be developed, might better adapt the specific needs of these patients."
CD008054,0,12133274,0,Oncolytic herpesvirus effectively treats murine squamous cell carcinoma and spreads by natural lymphatics to treat sites of lymphatic metastases.,"Oncolytic herpesviruses have significant antitumoral effects in animal models when delivered directly to established tumors. Lymphatic metastases are a common occurrence for many tumor types. This study investigates the potential of an attenuated, replication-competent, oncolytic herpes simplex virus (NV1023) both to treat a primary tumor by direct injection and to travel through the lymphatic system to treat metastatic tumor within the lymph nodes draining lymph from the site of primary cancer. Isosulfan blue dye was injected into murine auricles to determine normal lymphatic drainage patterns and demonstrated consistent blue staining of a group of ipsilateral cervical lymph nodes. Auricular injections of NV1023 resulted in viral transit to these lymph nodes as measured by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside histochemistry and viral plaque assay. An oncolytic herpesvirus (NV1066) expressing green fluorescent protein also demonstrated viral transit from the auricle to the cervical lymph nodes on fluorescence microscopy. Using the SCC VII cell line, a novel murine model of auricular squamous cell carcinoma was developed with an approximately 20% incidence of cervical lymph node metastases. Delivery of NV1023 or NV1066 to the surgical beds after excision of auricular SCC VII tumors resulted in successful viral infection of metastatic SCC VII cells within the cervical lymph nodes. After a 7-week follow-up, significantly enhanced locoregional control (p < 0.05, Fisher exact test) and disease-free survival (p < 0.05, log rank test) were evident with NV1023 treatment. This study demonstrates that the delivery of an oncolytic herpesvirus to a primary tumor site after surgical excision may have a significant impact on reducing both primary site recurrence and regional nodal metastases."

HPVs were identified as ""high-risk"" or ""low-risk"" by Hybrid Capture. The final disease status was categorized as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) by histology (n = 26), low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion (LSIL) by histology (n = 43), equivocal [histology negative, cytology atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or higher, n = 42], and negative (both histology and cytology negative, n = 40). Thirty-five percent of disease-negative women and 84% of the women with biopsy-proven or equivocal disease were HPV-positive. Ninety-two percent of the HPV-positive women harbored high-risk HPVs, either high-risk HPVs alone (77%) or high-risk HPVs along with low-risk HPVs (15%). High-risk HPVs predominated in disease-negative as well as disease-positive women. Collection of specimens with a cytobrush was more efficient for HPV DNA detection than collection by cervicovaginal lavage. Large amounts of HPV DNA correlated with presence of HSIL or LSIL. For detection of HSIL, considering only brush samples, the sensitivities of abnormal cytology (ASCUS or higher), of high-risk HPVs, and of the two combined were, respectively, 87, 93, and 100%; the corresponding specificities were 30, 30, and 20%.

All cases and controls had normal cervicovaginal cytology at the enrollment. A commercial dot-blot technique hybridization test (Virapap and Viratype, Digene Diagnostics, USA) was used for HPV DNA testing of cervicovaginal scrapes. Five percent of the patients had HPV 16/18, 31% had HPV 31/33/35, 15% had more than one of the three HPV DNA groups (""mixed""), and 15% had untypable HPV DNA. Cases and controls were followed by repeat examinations every 4th month. The mean follow-up time was 12.2 months (SD 8.7) for the cases, and 12.8 months (SD 6.9) for the controls. The study endpoint was defined as the presence of cytologic changes consistent with CIN. The overall prevalence of atypical transformation zone (ATZ) findings was 45% in the controls and 56% in the cases, with no significant differences between the specific HPV DNA groups. Although vulvar or vaginal abnormalities (acetowhite epithelium, squamous papillomatosis, filaments, satellite lesions, fissures, papules or exophytic condylomas) were more commonly seen in the cases than in the controls, the difference was significant only for condylomas and fissures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

There was no significant difference between the Ag-NOR count in condylomatous lesions and CIN I. Significant differences were found between the number of Ag-NORs in condylomatous lesions and in the various grades of CIN. The Ag-NOR technique is useful in the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and confirms the need to regard condylomata of the uterine cervix as intraepithelial neoplasia grade I and recommend these patients for follow-up."
CD008054,0,14706904,0,[The cost of screening for breast and cervical cancer in France].,"This article presents existing data on the cost of breast cancer and cervical screening programmes in France. The average direct cost of breast cancer screening was estimated at 57.77-60.51 Euro per woman attending for screening. Organisational costs account for 15-24% of total costs and the efficiency of existing screening programmes has improved over time. There is little available data on the cost of cervical cancer screening in France. The decentralised model of screening followed for both cervical and breast cancer programmes in France is more costly than the centralised model adopted by most other European countries. The best way to improve the economic value of screening programmes is to increase attendance rates. Attendance is currently inadequate for both screening programmes in France. For cervical screening, it is more cost-effective to increase screening attendance than to increase the frequency of screening. As long as screening attendance remains low, the impact of existing screening programmes will be suboptimal. Thus any new allocation of resources towards cervical and breast cancer screening in France should be assessed with caution."

The objective of the experiment was to assess the efficiency of handling the cervical infection caused by the HPV, by means of trichloroacetic acid, 85% rate. During the period comprised between April 1989 and March 1990, 60 patients were subject to close analysis. The general diagnosis drawn cytology, colposcopy, and histopathology was cervical condyloma, lacking any collateral evidence of intraepithelial cervical neoplasia. The treatment consisted of 3 weekly applications of trichloroacetic acid at 85% rate directly upon the cervix. They were all assessed through cytology and colposcopy every 3 months, during a year's period. After the first 3 months, a 73.4% healing rate was observed, which decreased to 68% after 6 months and to a 65% after 9 months; this last healing rate remained unchanged after 12 months. Pregnant patients showed higher healing rates. We have drawn the conclusions that the trichloroacetic acid is an efficient agent to treat the referred injuries, and it offers as well the advantages of low costs, no secondary effects and an easy application and handling."

Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are important in the presentation of foreign antigens to the immune system. Previous studies have suggested a possible association between HLA and cervical neoplasia, but the specific alleles found to be associated with disease have varied between studies. To further evaluate this issue, we conducted a nested case-control study within a 24,000-woman cohort study in the United States. A total of 711 women were selected for the study: 141 women diagnosed with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) of the cervix; 202 women diagnosed with low-grade SILs (LSILs); 166 women with no history of cervical neoplasia, but evidence of HPV-16 infection; and 202 women with no history of cervical abnormalities and who were HPV negative during follow-up as part of our cohort. Cervicovaginal lavage samples collected from participants were used for HPV testing by L1 consensus primer PCR and the Hybrid Capture tube test methods. DNA extracted from these same lavage samples were used for PCR-based HLA genotyping. Our results suggest a positive association between HLA B7 and HLA DQB1*0302 and disease. A negative association with disease was observed for HLA DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 and DRB1*13. Associations were strongest when analyses were restricted to HPV-16-positive cases as follows. Compared with women who were cytologically normal and HPV negative, HLA B7 was associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk of HPV/LSIL [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.95-2.5] and a 2.5-fold increased risk of HSIL (95% CI = 1.2-5.1). HLA DQB1*0302 was associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk of HPV/LSIL (95% CI = 0.94-2.4) and a 1.7-fold increased risk of HSIL (95% CI = 0.84-3.5). HLA DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 was associated with a decreased risk of HSIL [relative risk (RR) = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.07-0.62]. HLA DRB1*13 was associated with a decreased risk of HPV/LSIL (RR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.51-1.2) and HSIL (RR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.30-1.3). Individuals who were either homozygous for DQB1*0302 or carriers of both B7 and DQB1*0302 were found to be at highest risk of disease (RR = 4.5, 95% CI = 1.5-14 for HPV/LSIL; and RR = 9.0, 95% CI = 2.4-34 for HSIL). No synergistic effect was observed for the alleles found to be associated with reduced risk of cervical neoplasia. Our findings support previous studies that have found HLA B7 and DQB1*0302 to be positively associated with cervical neoplasia and are consistent with those that have suggested that DRB1*13 is negatively associated with disease, but do not confirm previous assertions that DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 increases the risk of cervical disease."

Imatinib was evaluated both alone and in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) primary cultures and established cell lines representing squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). Over 90% of ACC tumors are c-kit-positive, and these primary cultures proved to be of short-term usefulness in assessing chemosensitivity. Interaction was determined over a wide range of drug combinations using a statistical three-dimensional analysis model. Both ACC short-term cultures and HNSCC cell lines were demonstrated to have a response ranging from additive to synergistic when imatinib and cisplatin were combined. The interaction of imatinib on cisplatin-induced DNA cross-linking was further investigated using the comet-X assay. In contrast, significant antagonism was observed when imatinib and gemcitabine were combined. Since gemcitabine is activated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), the effect of imatinib on this enzyme was investigated. A dose-dependent inhibition of dCK was observed, highlighting this kinase as a possible additional secondary molecular target for imatinib. This work demonstrates a synergistic interaction between cisplatin and imatinib, which may prove to be clinically relevant in the future management of both ACC and HNSCC."

All the patients underwent surgery alone or in combination with radiotherapy (X-ray)/chemotherapy. A follow-up lasted 6 to 120 months. DNA was measured in the operative tumor tissue specimens by using an ICP-22 flow cytometer. Diploid and aneuploid cancers occurred in 20.4-53.6 and 43.6-79.6% of cases, respectively. The frequency of recurrences was mainly associated with aneuploidy and it was more than thrice higher than that with diploidy (21.0-43.2 versus 4.5-14.4%). Five-year survival was twice worse in patients with aneuploid tumors than in those with diploid ones. The survival rates after one operation, preoperative, and postoperative radiation therapy was greater in patients with diploid tumors than in patients with aneuploid ones. Thus, DNA-ploidy of the study neoplasms is of high informative value in predicting the course of a tumorous process and in choosing treatment policy on an individual basis."
CD008054,0,10870595,0,Pathogenesis of non-AIDS-defining cancers: a review.,"As the AIDS epidemic advances, the number of HIV-infected subjects developing AIDS-related neoplasms is rapidly increasing, and the spectrum of malignancies encountered is expanding. Several non-AIDS-defining cancers are being reported at an increasing incidence in HIV-infected individuals, including anal, skin, oral mucosa, head and neck and lung carcinomas, testicular tumors, and pediatric soft-tissue sarcoma. There appears to be an emerging role for various concurrent viral infections in the HIV-infected host that are likely implicated in the pathogenesis of some nondefining-AIDS neoplasms. Our recent findings in HIV-associated lung cancers and in the precursor lesions of cervical carcinoma suggest that wide-spread genomic instability, as manifested by the development of increased numbers of microsatellite alterations (MAs), may occur frequently in HIV-associated tumors and they may play an important role in the pathogenesis of those neoplasms. Although the mechanism underlying the development of increased MAs is unknown, it may play a crucial role in the development of many HIV-associated tumors. It will be important to track the epidemiological and biological features of non-AIDS-defining cancers in HIV-infected patients, and compare them to those tumors in the general population. It is likely that further clues about malignant transformation and oncogenesis unraveled in the HIV setting will have broad clinical implications."

Treatment options are aimed at destroying the visible lesions and include topical therapy, laser vaporization, cryocautery, liquid nitrogen, or simple excision. Health care providers have an important role in counseling about HPV infections. This includes educating clients about risk factors, prevention, signs and symptoms of STDs including HPV, safe sex practices, and the importance of regular examinations. Empowerment and a positive approach must be taken to help the client understand that she has a right to protect herself from STDs including HPV."
CD008054,0,19569231,0,Neither one-time negative screening tests nor negative colposcopy provides absolute reassurance against cervical cancer.,"A population sample of 10,049 women living in Guanacaste, Costa Rica, was recruited into a natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical neoplasia study in 1993-1994. At the enrollment visit, we applied multiple state-of-the-art cervical cancer screening methods to detect prevalent cervical cancer and to prevent subsequent cervical cancers by the timely detection and treatment of precancerous lesions. Women were screened at enrollment with 3 kinds of cytology (often reviewed by more than one pathologist), visual inspection and cervicography. Any positive screening test led to colposcopic referral and biopsy and/or excisional treatment of CIN2 or worse. We retrospectively tested stored specimens with an early HPV test (hybrid capture tube test) and for >40 HPV genotypes using a research PCR assay. We followed women typically 5-7 years and some up to 11 years. Nonetheless, 16 cases of invasive cervical cancer were diagnosed during follow-up. Six cancer cases were failures at enrollment to detect abnormalities by cytology screening; 3 of the 6 were also negative at enrollment by sensitive HPV DNA testing. Seven cancers represent failures of colposcopy to diagnose cancer or a precancerous lesion in screen-positive women. Finally, 3 cases arose despite attempted excisional treatment of precancerous lesions. Based on this evidence, we suggest that no current secondary cervical cancer prevention technologies applied once in a previously under-screened population is likely to be 100% efficacious in preventing incident diagnoses of invasive cervical cancer."

The subjects consisted of 9 males and 5 females, ranging in age from 9 to 61 years, with a mean age of 30 years and a median age of 24 years. None of the patients exhibited systemic symptoms. The affected lymph nodes were located in the head and neck area except in 1 case. At the time of lymph node biopsy, 1 patient was diagnosed as having acute infectious mononucleosis (IM) and 2 patients had a recent history of acute IM. One each with myelogenous leukemia or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma had a history of peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. There were no recurrences during follow-up periods ranging from 3 to 50 months. Histologically, 14 lesions were characterized by numerous enlarged, coalescing lymphoid follicles with distortion rather than effacement of the lymph node architecture. By in situ hybridization, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes were demonstrated in 5 (36%) of 14 cases. The present study indicates that a portion of RHGF appears to represent a histologic finding of acute IM. Moreover, as previously stated, RHGF should be differentiated from follicular lymphoma, particularly the floral variant."

The value of HPV DNA testing in the management of patients with disease and in population screening is a subject of controversy. Since the introduction of molecular biology into the HPV field, there have been rapid advances and improvements in HPV diagnosis. The various molecular diagnostic methods for detection of HPV DNA (dot blot hybridization, Southern blot hybridization, in situ hybridization, Hybrid Capture Test, and polymerase chain reaction; PCR) could be selected by taking into consideration some factors such as characteristics of sample, sensitivity of HPV test and expenses. The HPV DNA testing would be a clinically useful diagnostic method, when used in conjunction with the Pap smear in population screening or in conjunction with cytology and colposcopy to identify the women infected with high-risk HPVs or women who had equivocal cervical lesions.

CD008054,0,9805942,0,[Viral sexually transmitted diseases and their treatments].,"In occidental countries, the sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) originate mostly from virus: human papillomavirus (HPV) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV). During the latest 15 to 20 years, their prevalence has been regularly growing. Those viruses have in common a capacity for latency. The persistence of the virus in keratinocytes (PVH) or in ganglionic cells (HSV) and the lack of an efficient preventive or final curative treatment have several consequences: 1) a possible capacity of transmitting itself during sexual intercourse in the absence of clinical lesions, 2) a potency to recur all along the life especially when the organism suffer from immunodepression (patients with graft, chimiotherapy or AIDS). The oncogenic capacity of some HPV subtypes in anogenital cancers is now recognized. Those neoplasias are observed most often in immunodepressed patients but are nevertheless classically found in the uterine cervix of immunocompetent women. Genital herpes is often clinically diagnosed but its confirmation is obtained through isolating the HSV from the liquid of the vesicles or from a swab of the lesion. Biopsy is not usually useful. For HPVs, it is different since culture of papillomavirus is not possible. Diagnosis can then be get through biopsy: specific features (koÃ¯locytes) or HPV identification.

CD008054,0,21193120,0,[What's new in dermatological treatments?].,"Although the isolated clinical cases published are sometimes helpful in individual situations in which the therapeutic options have been exhausted, this type of publication cannot be generalized. For this reason, the selection presented covering the period from November 2009 to October 2010 is to a very large extent based on controlled trials, either because they contribute important information or because they raise great hope for a significant number of patients. For the first time in cutaneous oncology, a treatment (ipilimumab) has significantly increased overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma (phase III), although this gain remains modest (4-6 months) and adverse immunological effects are frequent (30-40%). A phase I trial with treatment specifically targeting the mutant BRAF protein has shown an objective response in 81% of the patients treated in the metastatic phase of melanoma, thus allowing its development to be pursued. Grouping two studies in a rare tumor such as dermatofibrosarcoma also gives hope with imatinib as a neoadjuvant treatment when the initial tumor is inoperable, with, however, an inconsistent response of approximately 50% and only if the tumor presents reorganization of chromosomes 17 and 22. Cutaneous inflammatory diseases are still dominated by dual therapies in psoriasis, with, notably, an effectiveness trial on etanercept at different doses not showing a difference in efficacy depending on dose for the joint component of psoriasis, but also by the publication of a direct comparison of two dual therapies, ustekinumab versus etanercept. In atopic dermatitis, a controversial article invites one to reflect upon the progress made in the management of children by clinical nurses, as in the Netherlands and in Great Britain, in an attempt to contend with the shortage of dermatologists. Since the use of biotherapies is not the prerogative of psoriasis, infliximab was assessed in a phase II trial in Verneuil disease without demonstrating significant efficacy on the main criterion, but it did show a tendency to reduce the score used. This trial suffered from a weakness both in methodology and statistical power, thus precluding any conclusion. The rarity of therapeutic trials on drug eruptions warrants their mention. A French phase II study gives a glimpse of a trend toward efficacy in terms of survival in the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis with cyclosporine. As for infectious dermatosis and sexually transmitted infections, a French multicenter study has shown significantly higher efficacy with ivermectin than with malathion in treating pediculosis without increasing the side effects. Today, however, this systemic treatment cannot be a first-line treatment outside of certain specific situations. A large cohort study (somewhat unsatisfactory in its methodology) has not demonstrated the teratogenicity of antiherpes treatments in 830,000 infants. In prevention of HIV transmission, no microbicidal gel had shown efficacy to date. This has now been accomplished in South Africa with a 1% tenofovir gel. The results of a preliminary trial on therapeutic vaccination against HPV16 proposed to women who are carriers of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia opens the way for wide vaccine therapy of cutaneous virus-induced neoplasia.

CD008054,0,12950011,0,The clinical relevance of human papillomavirus testing: relationship between analytical and clinical sensitivity.,"Given the fact that infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is causally involved in cervical cancer, addition of high-risk HPV testing to a cervical smear may improve the efficacy of cervical cancer screening programmes, the triage of women with equivocal or borderline Pap smears, and the monitoring of women who have been treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3). Compared to a cervical smear HPV tests revealed a superior sensitivity (ie clinical sensitivity) for lesions >/= CIN 3, and a negative predictive value approaching 100%. However, a potential complication is the availability of several HPV testing methods, all displaying a different sensitivity and specificity to detect HPV-positive women (ie analytical sensitivity and specificity). There is now compelling evidence that the clinical sensitivity and specificity of HPV tests are not simply synonymous to their analytical sensitivity and specificity, respectively. In fact, a distinction between so-called clinically relevant and irrelevant high-risk HPV infections should be made when considering HPV tests for primary screening, triage policies, or post-treatment monitoring. Here, we discuss the potential importance of HPV load in the context of currently widely applied HPV detection methods, to distinguish clinically relevant from irrelevant HPV infections. From this it can be concluded that it is of utmost importance to define criteria, involving viral load threshold and the type of HPV detection method that should be fulfilled by an HPV test before implementation of such a test in clinical practice and population-based cervical cancer screening programmes."

To establish a basis for the interpretation of DNA flow cytometric results of gynecologic neoplasms, paraffin blocks from 121 patients with a diagnosis of serous cystadenoma (n = 37), mucinous cystadenoma (n = 28), leiomyoma (n = 41), and fibrothecoma (n = 15), and normal tissue samples obtained from some of these patients, including ovary (n = 20), cervix (n = 20), and myometrium (n = 20) were analyzed for nuclear DNA content. Absence of DNA aneuploidy was confirmed in all the normal tissues analyzed. Three (7.3%) of the leiomyomas, three (10.7%) of the mucinous cystadenomas, and one (6.7%) of the fibrothecomas were DNA aneuploid, whereas no unequivocal aneuploidy was found in the serous cystadenomas. The DNA indices of the aneuploid peaks varied between 1.10 and 1.97. The frequency of aneuploidy was related to tumor size in leiomyoma (p < 0.05). Prominent myxoid degeneration was noted in two of the three aneuploid leiomyomas. One of the three aneuploid mucinous tumors had focal cellular atypia and increased mitotic activity, and another had prominent papillary infoldings, focal breakdown of cyst walls, and rupture of mucin into the ovarian stroma. There was no progression or recurrence in those patients who had histologically benign but DNA aneuploid tumors during a mean follow-up of 58.1 months."

CD008054,0,15211058,0,[Human papillomavirus testing in cervical cancer screening].,"Virtually all cases of cervical cancer are caused by one of the 18 oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV). It is estimated that 80% of all women will be infected by HPV in a lifetime, and the prevalence of HPV is highest among young, sexually active women and declines with increasing age. The risk of developing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions depends on the actual HPV type,the duration of infection, and the viral load. Due to the high prevalence of HPV infection, HPV testing in young women is of little value. The high negative predictive value of this test, combined with nor-mal Papanicolaou smear results, almost ensures that the patient is or will be free of a cancer precursor at the time of testing or in the immediate future. Hence, HPV testing combined with cytology is a reasonable approach in elderly women in order to increase the screening interval to 3-5 years. HPV testing is established for triage of borderline cytology findings of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance if colposcopy is not performed immediately and if HPV-negative women are rescheduled within 12 months. HPV testing 6 months after cone biopsy allows increasing the follow-up interval due to its high negative predictive value. In atypical glandular lesions not otherwise specified, HPV testing may identify patients requiring immediate treatment. In immunocompromised patients with borderline cytology due to persistent HPV infection, HPV test-ing identifies patients with a low risk of cancer precursors not requiring treatment."

We investigated the seroepidemiology of this virus using virus-like particles. The IgG response to HPV 73 appeared to be HPV type-specific, since a comparison of HPV 73 antibody levels before and after infection with HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 or 33 found no evidence of cross-induction of HPV 73 antibodies and since there was little correlation between the antibody levels to HPV 73 and the other 5 investigated HPV types. In both a cross-sectional serosurvey that included 274 women and a 7-year follow-up study that enrolled 98 women, HPV 73 seropositivity was found to be strongly dependent on the number of lifetime sexual partners [OR for > 4 vs. 0 to 1 partners: 6.0 (95%CI: 1.4-53.6) and 7.9 (95% CI: 2.8-28.3), respectively]. Finally, the risk for HPV 73 seropositive women to develop CIN was investigated in a prospective study nested in a cohort of 15,234 Swedish women. The population-based HPV 73 seroprevalence in Sweden was 14%. No excess risk for CIN was found (OR: 0.77).

Thirty-four cervical biopsy specimens and isolated cells from cervical smears of normal women or women diagnosed with high-grade intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) were screened for the presence of HPV by in situ hybridization (ISH) and/or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The exact HPV type was determined using a novel restriction typing method. The detection of HPV was facilitated greatly by the use of a PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based method. HPV was detected by PCR in 32% of the biopsy specimens, whereas only 23% had a positive staining by ISH. In one case, a double infection was detected by ISH as well as by PCR. In two cases, the presence of HPV was detected by both methods but the exact type was different. Analyzing cells isolated from cervical smears by the PCR-ELISA technique or by PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, HPV was detected only in patients with HGSIL and not in the control group. The PCR system is more sensitive than conventional ISH, and the PCR-ELISA system presented in this study is efficient in screening large series of cytological samples. Furthermore, this system allows exact HPV typing on the microtiter plate. These innovations may allow the application of HPV detection and typing as a routine screening method to identify patients with a high risk of developing cervical neoplasia."

The majority of squamous intraepithelial lesions will remit spontaneously and less than 1% will progress to invasive cancer. HPV-DNA testing has not provided a foolproof way to triage lesions. Therefore, the management of abnormal Pap smears is dependent on the personal experience of the physician, who must consider the following questions. What is the accuracy of your cytology laboratory? Does it overdiagnose or underdiagnose? How often has an ASCUS or LSIL become HSIL or invasive cancer on histologic evaluation? Will your patients come back for follow up? Will their health insurance cover frequent follow-up Pap smears or colposcopies? Do you have the resources to follow every patient who needs it? Do you want to avoid the development of every invasive cancer that may develop during the period of follow up?"

In the United States, 50% of adolescent and young women acquire HPV within 3 years after initiating sexual intercourse, resulting in relatively high prevalence rates. Most infections, however, are transient and clear within several months. Consequently HPV infections detected in adolescents are likely to reflect benign disease, whereas infections detected in older women are likely to reflect persistent infections and a higher risk of advanced cervical intraepithelial lesions that can lead to invasive cervical cancer.

CD008054,0,18544435,0,Update on molecular diagnostic tests in head and neck cancer.,"Head and neck cancers (HNCs) include several cancers originating in the upper airways that represent a variety of histologies. The most common type of HNC is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which is linked to tobacco and alcohol use and to human papilloma virus (HPV). At present, there are no standard molecular tests that are routinely used in clinics. This overview will discuss the current knowledge on molecular markers with the potential to be developed as diagnostic tests for cancer risk assessment, early detection, clinical response prediction to specific therapies, and prognosis. These markers are usually based on recent findings in tumor biology and genetic defects in HNC, and provide information both independently and in combination with currently available clinical parameters. In practice, many potential markers are difficult to measure due to assay variability, lack of standards for the interpretation of assay results, and incomplete knowledge of the effects on disease biology and response to treatment. However, there is great enthusiasm for the general concept of using molecular knowledge for the clinical management of HNC. Although it will be a great challenge to develop robust and reliable molecular diagnostic tests, the development of promising assays fueled by advances in science and technology will continue and will ultimately reach the goal of improving the care of HNC patients."

There is substantial evidence that young children, and especially the fetus, are highly vulnerable to ionizing radiation. Investigations also suggest that sensitivity may increase at the oldest ages of exposure. Further attention to modifying factors in radiation-cancer associations, such as age at exposure, may help to protect workers and the public by improving our understanding of sensitivity variation within populations."

HPV testing should not replace cervical cytology as the first-line approach in screening for cervical cancer, as HPV testing is not sufficiently reliable and some cancers are not associated with HPV infection. Even though there are many unanswered questions about the validity of HPV tests, it is timely to consider whether HPV testing might improve the management of the substantial number of women whose smears are neither clearly normal nor abnormal, but are described as atypical, suspicious or mildly dyskaryotic. The efficacy and costs of incorporating HPV testing into a cervical cancer screening programme need to be evaluated in controlled trials."

Cytohistologic correlation with the results of the HPV testing in 52 patients over a 3year period is presented. Two patients out of the 52 patients presented in this histologic follow up bore the diagnosis high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) with the former cytology ASC-H. Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) were found in eight patients, half of them diagnosed identically on cytology. Another four cases were formerly diagnosed cytologically as ASC-US. All women with the histologically confirmed dysplastic changes were HR HPV DNA positive. Our results indicate that significant histologic lesions may be discovered in patients exhibiting the high-risk HPV DNA positivity in the category of ASC-US (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance) and especially ASC-H (ASC cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). A combined screening test thus offers the possibility of greater protection and /or longer screening intervals."

CD008054,0,8978202,0,[Genital papillomavirus infections].,"The incidence of condyloma acuminata is increasing in all developed countries with highest rates recorded for young sexually males and females, between the ages of 16 and 25 years. Subclinical and latent genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are highly prevalent. Direct correlation between number of sexual partners and presence of HPV is evident. Clinical HPV infections such as condylomas (acuminata and papular) are easily recognized, but acetowhite flat macular condylomas require colposcopic examination. High grade IN (cervical CIN II, III, vulvar VIN, anal AIN, penile PIN) are considered to be related to HPV type 16 and 18 (less frequently other types 31, 33, 35, 51), the oncogenic potential of which was demonstrated by in vitro transformation assays and by the fact that they are detected in 50 to 90% of genital neoplasia. Clinical HPV infections (condylomas and low grade IN) are associated with ""low risk"" HPV types 6/11. The requirement for routine HPV-DNA typing is limited and in general, management is based on clinical and conventional light microscope evaluation. Immunosuppression is a most important risk-factor for the development, the progression and the recurrences of cervical and anal condylomas and neoplasia. Whatever treatment is applied a 30% recurrences rates occur, implying a regular clinical follow up after treatment to prevent recurrences development and neoplasia."
CD008054,0,18424016,1,[Importance of human papillomavirus (HPV) screening in the follow-up after CIN2-3 treatment].,"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 and CIN3 lesions clearly represent precancerous states even if some of them would heal spontaneously. Management is based on surgical excision of part of the uterine cervix because such lesions can potentially progress into carcinomas. In most cases, this treatment leads to the cure of intraepithelial lesions. However, even after such an efficient treatment, theses patients are still at a higher risk of developing an invasive cervical cancer. That is why guidelines recommend a specific follow-up in order to screen for residual disease (incomplete excision) or for recurrences (after a complete excision). The actual problem in the follow-up strategy lies in the screening tools in use - cervical smears and colposcopy - whose sensitivities are low and hence, not quite sufficient when applied to a high risk population. These intraepithelial lesions are due to high risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) and there cannot be any lesion progression without HPV. Consequently, a viral testing would help in identifying a high risk subpopulation of women after cone loop cervical excision."
CD008054,0,9414187,0,Neurofibroma and cellular neurofibroma with atypia: a report of 14 tumors.,"The clinical significance of nuclear atypia in neurofibromas that lack necrosis or significant mitotic activity has not been systematically studied. We reviewed 14 neurofibromas from six patients with mild to marked nuclear atypia, with low mitotic activity in some tumors. Five tumors also had areas of increased cellularity consistent with cellular neurofibroma. Necrosis was absent. All patients were treated by conservative excision. Clinical follow-up, ranging from 8 months to 6 years, showed that none of the tumors recurred or metastasized. To further characterize these neoplasms, we assessed p53 expression, proliferation rate, and DNA content because these methods have been suggested by others as useful in differentiating benign from malignant nerve sheath tumors. p53 expression was detected by immunostaining in one tumor with 5% positive cells and in two tumors with rare positive cells (<1%). The remaining 11 tumors were negative. Tumor cell proliferation rate as determined by Ki-67 immunostaining showed <5% positive cells in 13 tumors. In one tumor, 10% of the cells were Ki-67 positive. Using flow cytometry methods and paraffin-embedded tissue, all tumors had diploid DNA content with an S phase fraction ranging from 5.2% to 18.2% (mean 9.4%). No significant differences were observed between the neurofibromas and cellular neurofibromas. For comparison, we studied three malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). All MPNSTs had relatively high p53 (range 10-16%; mean 12%) and Ki-67 (range 32-42%; mean 38.0%) staining. One of the MPNSTs was aneuploid. The S phase fraction of the MPNSTs ranged from 8.1% to 51.8% (mean 28.6%). These results suggest that clinically benign neurofibromas, both usual and cellular types, can have significant cytologic atypia that can be accompanied by low mitotic activity. Conservative surgical excision for these tumors is adequate. The results of p53 and Ki-67 immunostaining and DNA content and S-phase analysis by flow cytometry support this interpretation. In addition, in tumors with borderline histologic findings, results of these ancillary studies may be useful in distinguishing benign from malignant nerve sheath tumors."
CD008054,0,21071728,0,Human papillomavirus type 16 e6 gene variations in young Chinese women with cervical squamous cell carcinoma.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E6 gene mutation is considered an important genetic change in cervical lesion progression. To explore the possible association of specific HPV16 E6 sequence variations with the development of invasive cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in young women, we examined the distribution of HPV16 E6 variants in a Chinese cervical SCC population and analyzed the difference between younger patients (â¤35 years, n = 50) and older ones (>35ys, n = 71). Human papillomavirus type 16 E6 DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced by Sanger fluorescent dye dideoxy-termination method. Analysis revealed that the most frequently found variation in this Chinese population was the EV (As) lineage (65.45%). In addition, the EV (As) lineage seems more common and uniform in younger patients than other lineages, and it may be associated with early age at diagnosis of cervical SCC in young women."
CD008054,0,16217759,1,Evaluation of cervical screening strategies with adjunct high-risk human papillomavirus testing for women with borderline or mild dyskaryosis.,"The management of women with a smear read as borderline/mild dyskaryosis (BMD) found by cervical cancer screening is still under discussion as only few of these cases are associated with high-grade lesions. To determine the optimal screening strategy for these women, a simulation model of cervical cancer development was used that is based on high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection. The current strategy of repeat cytological testing at 6 and 18 months after BMD was compared to strategies with adjunct hrHPV testing. Calculations were done for both conventional and liquid-based cytology as the primary screening tool. In comparison to current screening, adjunct hrHPV testing was more effective in preventing cancer and more woman-friendly (reduction in colposcopy referrals with outcome < cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2) of up to 56% and in repeat smears of 30-100%). In combination with conventional cytology, cost-effective strategies were the ones in which a sample for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing is collected at a return visit within 1 month or in which hrHPV testing is restricted to repeat smears taken at 6 and 18 months. For these strategies, co-collection of samples for hrHPV testing at baseline is not necessary which has organizational and cost advantages. In combination with liquid-based cytology, it was cost-effective to perform a reflex hrHPV test at baseline from the liquid-based specimen. Liquid-based screening was more effective than conventional screening, but annual diagnosis costs were euro5 million higher (population size 16 million). In conclusion, our calculations indicate that implementation of hrHPV testing for the management of women with borderline or mild dyskaryosis (BMD) is feasible both in settings where conventional and liquid-based cytology is current practice."

Results were compared with HPV demonstrated in tumor tissue and the clinical status at time of sample collection. Sensitivity and specificity of the lavage for detection of tumor HPV, determined on the basis of results of tests on lavage samples collected prior to therapy, were found to be 56% and 76.9%, respectively. The proportion of lavage samples detecting tumor HPV decreased significantly with treatment, from 0.54 at diagnosis to 0.03 at complete response (P < .001). Local treatment failure was associated with increased detection of tumor HPV; however, no samples were positive prior to clinically detected treatment failure.

Analogous to cervical cancer screening, anal Papanicplaou (Pap) smears currently are used to screen these high-risk populations. Human papilloma virus (HPV) has been implicated in anal carcinoma pathogenesis and this study was performed to assess the potential role of HPV DNA testing as an adjunct to anal cytology. We correlated cytological diagnoses and HPV DNA (Digene Hybrid Capture [HC II] assay) in anal specimens collected in SurePath liquid medium from 118 patients; 54.8% of cases diagnosed as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and 87.8% diagnosed as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or above tested positive for high- risk HPV DNA (B+). High-grade SIL (HSIL) was present in 31 of the 51 patients with follow-up. Although a cytological diagnosis of ASC-US or above was a reliable indicator for AIN, cytology frequently did not accurately predict the grade of SIL in subsequent biopsy. Our findings suggest that reflex HPV DNA testing would be helpful in triaging patients diagnosed with ASC-US. However, patients diagnosed with LSIL or above should go directly to ansocopic biopsy."

The models compare three management strategies: (1) repeat Pap smear, (2) triage with HPV DNA testing, or (3) immediate treatment. The primary outcome measure is incremental cost per case of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2+ detected and treated. The models take the perspective of the German health system. For patients with initial PapIIw, III, and IIId results, incremental cost effectiveness ratios for HPV triage versus repeat Pap smears are 2,232 euro, 815 euro, and 487 euro per additional case of CIN2+ detected and treated. In addition, the number of cases of CIN2+ detected and treated in a hypothetical population of 1,000 women increases from 17 to 35, 61 to 130, and 157 to 332 for each population, respectively. For patients with initial PapIII and IIId results, immediate treatment of 1,000 patients detects only four and 11 additional cases of CIN2+ versus HPV triage at incremental cost effectiveness ratios of 39,684 euro and 10,716 euro per case, respectively.

Two centres participated in an English pilot study of HPV testing. Participants included two groups of women receiving abnormal smear test results: (tested for HPV and found to be (a) HPV positive (n=369) or (b) HPV negative (n=252)) and two groups not tested for HPV (those receiving (c) abnormal smear test results (n=102) or (d) normal smear test results (n=288)). There were no differences in anxiety, distress or health-related quality of life between the four study groups at 6 months. Levels of concern about the smear test result remained elevated in all groups receiving an abnormal smear test result, and were highest in the group untested for HPV. Predictors of concern across all groups receiving an abnormal smear test were perceived risk of developing cancer, being HPV positive or untested for HPV, sexual health worries and the smear being a woman's first smear test. The raised anxiety and distress observed in women immediately after being informed of an abnormal smear test result and that they are HPV positive was no longer evident at 6 months. Concern about the smear test result was however still raised in these women and those who tested negative for HPV, and particularly among those who did not undergo HPV testing."

The diagnosis was based on histopathologic findings after open biopsy. Results of serologic studies, immunoperoxidase staining for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein, in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr encoded RNAs, and polymerase chain reaction amplification of EBV Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA) DNA suggested that EBV was the causative agent in both patients. The disease was mild and subsided after complete surgical resection in one patient, with a follow-up of 1 year. In the other patient, a short course of corticosteroids led to complete clinical remission within 2 months, but the child still has biologic signs of persistent EBV infection. He experienced relapse with a large cervical mass and fever 28 months after the initial onset. Histologic findings were identical to those at initial presentation. Symptoms again resolved spontaneously within 2 weeks, but the follow-up was short (12 mos) and the child's EBNA antibodies are still absent. No evidence of immunodeficiency was found in either child. The cause of Kikuchi disease is unknown, but a viral or postviral hyperimmune reaction has been proposed. Malignant lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus are differential diagnoses. Early recognition of Kikuchi disease minimizes potentially harmful and unnecessary investigations and treatments. These findings add Kikuchi disease to the protean manifestations of chronic EBV infection."

Results obtained with the Amplicor HPV and Hybrid Capture 2 (HC-2) assays for HR HPV DNA detection in women referred to colposcopy for an ASC-US smear were compared. Cervical samples in PreservCyt were tested for the presence of 13 HR HPV types with HC-2, with Amplicor at three cutoffs for positivity (0.2, 1.0, and 1.5 optical density units), and for 36 genotypes with the Linear Array (LA). Of 396 eligible women, 316 did not have CIN, 47 had CIN 1, 29 had CIN 2/3, and 4 had CIN of unknown grade.

CD008054,0,18594522,0,Quantitative methylation analyses of resection margins predict local recurrences and disease-specific deaths in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.,"This study sought to determine whether the presence of hypermethylated genes in the surgical margins can predict local recurrences in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). We prospectively collected tumour and surgical margin specimens from patients with HNSCCs who had undergone surgical resections. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (QMSP) of CDKN2A, CCNA1 and DCC were performed in these specimens and correlated with clinical data. Of the 42 patients eligible for the study, 27 were hypermethylation informative for the above three genes. This latter group was associated with longer disease-free survivals (P=0.007) and longer time to disease-specific deaths (P=0.004). Multivariate analyses confirmed hypermethylation non-informative tumours as an independent prognosticating factor for disease-specific deaths (risk ratio 3.8, P=0.026). Quantitative MSP of the margins of 24 hypermethylation informative tumours revealed that 11 patients had molecularly positive margins, of which, five developed disease-specific events (DSEs, three local recurrences and two metastases), compared to none in patients with molecularly negative margins, after a median follow-up of 48 months. Log-rank analyses showed that molecularly positive margins were associated with shorter time to local recurrences and disease-specific deaths (P=0.03 and 0.01, respectively). This study demonstrated that QMSP of hypermethylated promoters in surgical margins predicted all the local recurrences in our series of HNSCC patients. We have also identified hypermethylation non-informative tumours as an independent predictor for the development of DSEs."

The results were compared with those of a matched control group of 20 patients with noninvasive papillary tumors. Forty percent of the tumors with spread to extrathyroid tissue were aneuploid, whereas all the tumors without such extension were diploid. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.003). The data suggest that the differentiation of locally noninvasive and invasive papillary thyroid carcinomas may be potentially possible by nuclear DNA determination."

CD008054,0,12952506,0,The clinician's view: role of human papillomavirus testing in the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Guidelines for the management of abnormal cervical cytology and cervical cancer precursors.,"The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) National Consensus Conference for the Management of Women With Cervical Cytological Abnormalities and Cervical Cancer Precursors was held on the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Md, September 6-8, 2001. The conference was attended by 121 representatives from 29 national organizations interested in cervical cancer screening issues. For the first time, guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical cytology, developed from evidence-based literature, were presented to delegates from the majority of organizations with interest in cervical cancer screening, voted on, and revised when necessary to achieve a majority two-thirds approval. This development of consensus-approved guidelines is likely to be considered one of the most important milestones to date in the management of women with abnormal cervical cytology. The timing of this Consensus Conference resulted from the convergence of many different factors, including new cytologic terminology developed at the Bethesda 2001 workshop and publication of the enrollment data from the National Cancer Institute's Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASC-US)/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (LSIL) Triage Study, otherwise known as ALTS. Additionally, new preliminary longitudinal ALTS data provided much of the information on the natural history of abnormal Papanicolaou tests and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), as well as data on the performance of both new liquid-based cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing in the management of women following colposcopy. The result was a large database of new information that provided the foundation for the ASCCP Consensus Conference. This article covers only the recommendations of the ASCCP Guidelines that were based in large part on the results of the ALTS trial. Therefore, the focus is on the management of women with equivocal (ASC-US) and low-grade (LSIL) cytologic abnormalities. Management of women with these cytologic abnormalities has been particularly problematic, because individually these women are at least risk for CIN 3 and cancer, yet their sheer numerical dominance ensures that they account for the majority of high-grade CIN detected in the United States in the follow-up of abnormal cervical cytology. Data from ALTS confirmed that women with ASC-US could be safely managed by any of the conventional approaches (repeat Papanicolaou test, immediate colposcopy, or HPV testing), but that the preferred management approach for women having an ASC-US report from liquid-based cytology was to assess the patient's risk by testing for HPV. Additionally, longitudinal ALTS data determined that repeat liquid-based cytology at 6 and 12 months and an HPV test at 12 months were nearly equivalent options in the follow-up of women referred for HPV-positive ASC or LSIL, yet not found to have CIN 2+ at initial colposcopy. Therefore, all follow-up recommendations for women with CIN 1 or lower postcolposcopy findings include these 2 options. The data and the recommendations for the management of ASC-US, ASC cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and LSIL are discussed."
CD008054,0,17442018,0,Persistence of human papillomavirus as a predictor for treatment failure after loop electrosurgical excision procedure.,"We aimed to investigate whether postconization human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing can predict treatment failure and improve the accuracy of conventional follow-up in women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Between March 2001 and October 2005, 120 patients with confirmed CIN 2 or 3 were treated with loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and were enrolled. Six patients were lost to the follow-up. Postconization follow-up was performed at every 3-6 months during the first year and then annually. Specimens were tested for the presence of HPV, using the Hybrid Capture 2 (Digene Co, Gaithersburg, MD) and HPV DNA chip (Mygene Co, Seoul, Korea) test. Persistent HPV infection was defined as persistently (two times or more) positive HPV tests with the same HPV subtype(s) at initial diagnosis. Twenty-two (19.3%) patients showed treatment failure after conization. The only significant risk factor for redevelopment of CIN after conization was persistence of the same HPV subtype (P < 0.0001). And women with recurrent or residual CIN had higher HPV load during the 6-month follow-up postconization. In conclusion, the persistence of the same HPV subtype after LEEP conization was an important predictor of treatment failure. The follow-up protocol after conization of CIN should include both cervical cytology and HPV test, and HPV DNA chip test is needed to detect a persistent HPV infection."

CD008054,0,11920596,0,Persistent human papillomavirus infection and smoking increase risk of failure of treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).,"Women with abnormal smears have an increased risk of developing cervical cancer. During the 8 years following conservative treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), their risk of invasive cervical cancer is about 5 times greater than that of the general population. Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been associated with the natural history of both CIN and cervical cancer. To date, there have been no published reports on the predictive value of HPV testing in the treatment outcome of CIN. A prospective, multi-center, cohort study was conducted on women in the Northwest of England who were attending for treatment of CIN. They were asked to complete a questionnaire, which included a detailed smoking history. Pre- and post-treatment HPV testing was performed on cervical biopsies and cervical swab, being taken with the first follow-up smear at 6 months. A nested case-control analysis was performed, cases being defined as women who developed CIN within the 2 years of treatment and controls being sampled from those who did not experience treatment failure within 2 years. Multiple conditional logistic regression is used to study the factors associated with treatment failure of CIN. The cohort included 958 women of whom 77 (8%) experienced treatment failure (cases). Two controls were matched to each case (154). Smoking status was significantly associated with CIN treatment failure(p= 0.0013). Current smokers had a 3-fold increased risk of treatment failure of CIN as compared to non-smokers (95% CI 1.65 to 5.91). Five hundred twenty-five women underwent HPV sampling following treatment, of whom 47 (8.9%) developed further CIN. Post-treatment positive HPV testing was found to be strongly associated with treatment failure of CIN (OR 23.3; 95% CI 3.15-172.1). In 11/45 cases with negative smear at first follow-up, the HPV test was positive. The combination of both HPV and cytology in the first follow-up visit predicted treatment failure in 72% of the cases. Cigarette smoking is a factor, which, independently of HPV infection, influences the treatment outcome of CIN. Smokers and those who are HPV positive during follow-up appear to require longer, more intensive follow-up. HPV testing requires careful consideration as part of routine follow-up protocol following treatment of CIN."
CD008054,0,18945406,0,Integration of human papillomavirus vaccination and cervical cancer screening in Latin America and the Caribbean.,"Despite substantial efforts to control cervical cancer by screening, most Latin American and Caribbean countries continue to experience incidence rates of this disease that are much higher than those of other Western countries. The implementation of universal human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for young adolescent women is the best prospect for changing this situation. Even though there are financial challenges to overcome to implement such a policy, there is broad political support in the region for adopting universal HPV vaccination. The costs of implementing this policy could be largely alleviated by changing cervical cancer control practices that rely on inefficient use of resources presently allocated to cytology screening. In view of the strong evidence base concerning cervical cancer prevention technologies in the region and the expected impact of vaccination on the performance of cytology, we propose a reformulation of cervical cancer screening policies to be based on HPV testing using validated methods followed by cytologic triage. This approach would serve as the central component of a system that plays the dual role of providing screening and surveillance as integrated and complementary activities sharing centralized resources and coordination."
CD008054,0,15554555,0,P53 codon 72 polymorphism and correlation with ovarian and endometrial cancer in Greek women.,"The polymorphism of codon 72 in the p53 tumour suppressor gene has been associated in the last decade with the risk of developing various neoplasias. An influence of this polymorphism on ovarian and endometrial cancer has also been suggested. We examined the genotype frequency of this polymorphism in archival samples from 56 patients with endometrial neoplasias and 51 patients with ovarian neoplasias. Cervical smears from 30 healthy, human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative women with normal cytology and colposcopy, served as control sample. Women with ovarian neoplasias, especially adenocarcinomas, had Arg/Arg more often than healthy controls [odds ratio (OR) 4.16 at P = 0.0058]. No statistically significant difference was found between women with endometrial cancer and controls. Differentiation of ovarian tumours did not appear to be associated in a statistically significant manner with the genotype, whereas a positive linear trend of Arg/Arg towards poor differentiation was noted in endometrial malignancies (mainly endometrioid adenocarcinomas). Our results suggest that homozygous arginine at codon 72 of p53 may represent a risk factor for developing ovarian malignancies and may affect the differentiation of endometrial cancer. Further studies need to be carried out in order to establish the clinical use of this polymorphism for risk assessment and possibly outcome prediction of ovarian and endometrial neoplasias."
CD008054,0,20042622,0,Comparison of the clinical performance of PapilloCheck human papillomavirus detection with that of the GP5+/6+-PCR-enzyme immunoassay in population-based cervical screening.,"We compared the clinical performance of the PapilloCheck human papillomavirus (HPV) assay with that of the GP5+/6+-PCR method with an enzyme immunoassay readout (GP5+/6+-PCR-EIA) for the detection of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) types by the use of cervical samples originating from women in a population-based by the use of cervical screening cohort tested by combined cytology and GP5+/6+-PCR-EIA (POBASCAM trial). Specimens from a random sample of 1,437 controls (women ages 40 to 60 years with normal cytological findings and without evidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher [> or = CIN2] within up to 8 years of follow-up) and 192 cases (women ages 30 to 60 years in whom > or = CIN3 was detected within up to 3 years of follow-up) were subjected to analysis by the PapilloCheck method. When all 17 (probably) hrHPV types were taken into account, the PapilloCheck assay had a clinical sensitivity for the detection of > or = CIN3 of 96.4% (185/192 samples; 95% confidence interval [CI], 93.7 to 99.7) and a clinical specificity for the detection of > or = CIN2 of 96.3% (95% CI, 95.3 to 97.3). After restriction of the analysis by the PapilloCheck assay to the 14 hr HPV types targeted by GP5+/6+-PCR-EIA, the clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity values were 95.8% (95% CI, 92.8 to 98.8) and 96.7% (95% CI, 95.7 to 97.7), respectively. By comparison, these values were 96.4% (95% CI, 93.9 to 98.9) and 97.7% (95% CI, 96.9 to 98.5), respectively, for the GP5+/6+-PCR-EIA. When all 17 (probably) hrHPV types were included in the analysis, noninferiority score testing revealed that the clinical sensitivity of the PapilloCheck assay for the detection of > or = CIN3 was noninferior to that of the GP5+/6+-PCR-EIA (P < 0.0001), but the clinical specificity of the PapilloCheck assay for the detection of > or = CIN2 was inferior to that of the GP5+/6+-PCR-EIA (P = 0.08) when lower bounds of 90% for sensitivity and 98% for specificity were used. When the analysis was restricted to the 14 hrHPV types targeted by the GP5+/6+-PCR-EIA, both the clinical sensitivity and the clinical specificity of the PapilloCheck assay were noninferior to those of the GP5+/6+-PCR-EIA (noninferiority score test; P < 0.0001 and P = 0.007, respectively). Thus, when the findings obtained for the 14 hrHPV types detectable by the GP5+/6+-PCR-EIA are considered, the PapilloCheck assay is clinically compatible with the GP5+/6+-PCR-EIA."

CD008054,0,1309403,0,Evaluation and follow-up of abnormal Pap smears.,"An estimated 13,500 cases of invasive cervical cancer and 6,000 related deaths occur each year in the United States. These numbers can be significantly reduced if all women are regularly screened with Papanicolaou (Pap) smears and undergo colposcopy when abnormalities are detected. Screening with Pap smears should begin at age 18 or at the age of first sexual intercourse and should be repeated every one to three years, depending on individual risk factors, until age 65. Screening may be discontinued in women over age 65 who have had normal findings on two consecutive Pap smears. Risk factors for cervical cancer include sexual intercourse before age 20, more than two sexual partners in a lifetime, cigarette smoking and genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Use of a spatula and Cytobrush for cervical sampling will improve the chances of collecting an adequate sample containing endocervical cells. Family physicians must know the significance of various cervical abnormalities reported by the laboratory.

LA testing was done masked to LBA results and clinical outcomes. The results of LA and LBA testing were compared for detection of carcinogenic HPV and clinical outcomes of cervical precancer and cancer. Overall, 50% and 55% of the women tested positive for carcinogenic HPV by LBA and LA, respectively (P < 0.0001). The percent agreement for carcinogenic HPV detection was 88%, percent positive agreement was 80%, and kappa was 0.76 for detection of carcinogenic HPV by the two assays. There was a significant increase in detection by LA for most of the 37 HPV genotypes targeted by both assays, including for 13 of 14 carcinogenic HPV genotypes. LA detected more multiple-genotype infections for all HPV genotypes among HPV-positive women (P < 0.0001) and for carcinogenic HPV genotypes among carcinogenic-HPV-positive women (P < 0.0001). LA was more sensitive (92.3% versus 87.1%; P = 0.003) and less specific (48.2% versus 54.0%; P < 0.0001) than LBA for 2-year cumulative cervical precancer and cancer as diagnosed by the Pathology Quality Control Group. In conclusion, we found LA to be a promising assay for the detection of HPV genotypes and carcinogenic HPV, and it may be clinically useful for the detection of cervical precancer and cancer in women with equivocal cytology."

They discuss how molecular diagnostics can detect abnormalities in lesions not yet appreciated histologically, and thus detect early recurrences.

CD008054,0,14690310,0,The virology of cervical neoplasia: an HPV-associated malignancy.,"Human papillomaviruses are present in virtually all cervical cancers and cancer precursors. Understanding the epithelial virology of this group of viruses has greatly influenced current concepts of cervical carcinogenesis, has provided a framework for understanding the biologic basis of many diagnostic criteria, and has led to revised classification schemes, diagnostic testing, and modifications in clinical management. This paper briefly reviews virologic concepts supporting the pathogenetic role of these viruses in cervical neoplasia."
CD008054,0,14690311,0,Vaccines for cervical cancer.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are responsible for the nearly 450,000 cervical cancers that occur each year throughout the world. In the United States, the cancer rate is low (13,500 cases per year); nevertheless, HPVs affect millions of men and women annually in the form of genital warts and preinvasive diseases of the cervix and anogenital region. The expense of cancer prevention via precancer and cancer management is high, yet most HPV infections resolve spontaneously as a result of a successful host immune response. Recently, the discovery of methods to reproduce HPV virions (viral-like particles) in vitro has resulted in a successful clinical trial of preventing HPV infection and its associated precursor lesions. Although prevention is type-specific and duration of immunity is unknown, these results validate a vaccine strategy targeting prepubertal children that could prevent a significant proportion of genital warts and cervical precancers and cancers from occurring during reproductive life. Reversing advanced preinvasive and invasive cervical neoplasia with immunotherapeutics is a more difficult challenge, inasmuch as little or no evidence for natural immune-mediated regression of these diseases exists. Nonetheless, recent controlled trials have shown some success in inducing precursor regression with vaccines targeting viral oncoproteins. Anecdotal reports of therapies that augmentcellular immunity raise hopesthattherapeutics targeting multiple pathways of anti-viral or anti-tumor immunity will be beneficial to women with established cervical cancer. However, success will require identifying and circumventing the mechanisms by which tumor cells evade the immune system."
CD008054,0,14690312,0,Management of atypical and low-grade cervical cytology.,"The finding of atypical and low-grade cervical cytology on routine Papanicolaou test is considered problematic for gynecologists and pathologists. The interpretation and management of these cases can be difficult when Papanicolaou test results fall into the Bethesda 2001 categories of atypical squamous cells, atypical squamous cells--cannot rule out high-grade, atypical glandular cells, or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Although liquid-based Papanicolaou tests may have resulted in some improvement in detection, a large amount of variability in cytologic interpretations continues to exist. The recent approval of concurrent use of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA testing with cytology in the screening of women for cervical neoplasia adds a new dilemma to patient management: What should we do with women who are positive for high-risk human papillomavirus DNA but have negative cervical cytologic results?"
CD008054,0,9819106,0,An international survey of patients with genital warts: perceptions regarding treatment and impact on lifestyle.,"Our aim was to determine country-specific attitudes and perceptions of patients with genital warts and to understand the psychosexual impact of the disease and its treatment. We used a standardized discussion guide to interview patients with genital warts in Canada, France, Germany, the UK, and the USA about their perceptions and concerns regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and psychosexual impact of the disease. Interviews were conducted in person and lasted approximately 30 min. The study group included 80 men and 86 women with genital warts. Forty-seven per cent were currently undergoing treatment. Overall, 49% of the men had first consulted a general or family practitioner, and 52% of the women had first consulted a gynaecologist. Although all the patients eventually consulted a physician about their warts, one-third delayed seeing a doctor because they thought the condition would resolve on its own or that the problem was not serious. Most patients reported that treatment was associated with pain, discomfort, and embarrassment. Sixty per cent of patients experienced a recurrence after initial clearance with treatment. More than 80% stated that they had had little or no involvement in the selection of treatment. Globally, 52% of men and 61% of women were 'quite concerned' or 'very concerned' about having genital warts, although there were significant variations by country. Approximately two-thirds of patients had made lifestyle changes regarding sexual relationships. In addition, two-thirds believed that there were risks associated with having genital warts; the most common risk identified was a link to cancer (cervical and unspecified). A high level of anxiety is associated with the diagnosis and treatment of genital warts. Patients with genital warts require understanding and an acknowledgement of their concerns. A better understanding of the psychosexual aspect of the disease by health-care providers is pivotal to effective disease management and patient counselling."
CD008054,0,17086317,0,"Human papillomavirus status and cervical abnormalities in women from public and private health care in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil.","This article reports the HPV status and cervical cytological abnormalities in patients attended at public and private gynecological services from Rio de Janeiro State. It also comments the performance of each HPV DNA tests used. A set of 454 women from private health clinics was tested by routine Capture Hybrid II HPV DNA assay. Among these, 58.4% presented HPV and nearly 90% of them were infected by high risk HPV types. However, this group presented few premalignant cervical lesions and no invasive cervical cancer was registered. We also studied 220 women from low income class attended at public health system. They were HPV tested by polymerase chain reaction using My09/11 primers followed by HPV typing with E6 specific primers. The overall HPV prevalence was 77.3%. They also showed a high percentage of high squamous intraepithelial lesion-HSIL (26.3%), and invasive cervical carcinoma (16.3%). HPV infection was found in 93.1% and 94.4% of them, respectively. The mean ages in both groups were 31.5 and 38 years, respectively. In series 1, HPV prevalence declined with age, data consistent with viral transient infection. In series 2, HPV prevalence did not decline, independent of age interval, supporting not only the idea of viral persistence into this group, but also regional epidemiological variations in the same geographic area. Significant cytological differences were seen between both groups. Normal and benign cases were the most prevalent cytological findings in series 1 while pre-malignant lesions were the most common diagnosis in the series 2. HPV prevalence in normal cases were statistically higher than those from series 1 (p<0.001), indicating a higher exposure to HPV infection. Women from both samples were referred for previous abnormal cytology. However, socio-demographic evidence shows that women from series 1 have access to treatment more easily and faster than women from series 2 before the development of pre-malignant lesions. These data provides baseline support for the role of social inequalities linked to high risk HPV infection leading to cervical cancer. Broadly screening programs and the development of safe and effective vaccines against HPV would diminish the toll of this disease that affect mainly poor women."

CD008054,0,18649932,0,Impact of vaccination with Cervarix (trade mark) on subsequent HPV-16/18 infection and cervical disease in women 15-25 years of age.,"Cervical cancer of both squamous and adenocarcinoma types is considered virtually 100% attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV-16 and -18 are the predominant types worldwide accounting for over 70% of all cervical cancer. Persistent oncogenic HPV infection has been confirmed as one key determinant in the development of cervical precancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 2+) and cervical cancer. The impact of prophylactic HPV vaccination on the reduction of virological and cytohistological outcomes related to HPV-16 and -18 has been evaluated in clinical trials with the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted cervical cancer vaccine (Cervarixtrade mark) through a Phase IIb study with a long-term follow-up of efficacy up to 5.5 years, and a large Phase III trial in women 15-25 years of age. These individual studies include populations with different underlying risk factors, each of which shows high efficacy against both HPV-16/18 persistent infections and CIN2+. When the two studies are combined and the respective populations are evaluated, vaccine efficacy against HPV-16 and -18-related CIN2+ remains at 100%. As this vaccine is used over time in universal prophylactic HPV-16/18 vaccination of girls and women, reductions in cervical cancers at both the individual and public health levels will be appreciated."

CD008054,0,19256304,0,Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.,"Cutaneous SCC is the second most common skin cancer among whites. Most cases of primary cutaneous SCC are induced by UV radiation. Chronic sun exposure is the major risk factor, and favored locations include the head and neck and other sun-exposed areas. Moreover, it is important for the clinician to recognize other risk factors associated with this malignancy, including HPV infection, occupational exposures, various genodermatoses, scarring dermatoses, chronic wounds, and burn scars. The allogenic transplant population is at most risk for developing cutaneous SCC. For these patients, aggressive patient education, control of immunosuppression, and clinical surveillance should be the standard of care. Most patients who have primary SCC have an excellent prognosis, and treatment is usually straightforward. A substantial minority of these neoplasms, however, may recur or metastasize. Obtaining a complete history and performing a total-body skin examination can help to identify tumors at high risk for recurrence or metastasis in addition to those that may be more easily treated. For those individuals with metastatic disease, however, the long-term prognosis is guarded. Based on recent reports, in the future, there may be a role in SLNB for cutaneous SCC to diagnose subclinical metastasis accurately. Larger studies and better guidelines need to be developed before SLNB can be routinely used in the management of metastatic disease. Physicians should emphasize to their patients the benefits of sun avoidance and protection from sunlight, beginning in childhood, to minimize the risk for developing this potentially life-threatening neoplasm."
CD008054,0,19813272,0,Human papillomavirus vaccination in survivors of childhood cancer.,"Effective vaccination is now available to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common sexually transmitted infection and the cause of cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer among women worldwide. HPV vaccine uptake is particularly important for females surviving cancer, some of whom are at high risk for HPV complications because of the direct and indirect effects of cancer treatment. Thus, version 3.0 of the Children's Oncology Group's Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer recommends HPV vaccination for all eligible females surviving childhood cancer. Because this vaccine was only approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2006, little is known regarding the complexity of vaccination uptake among those surviving cancer. The purpose of this article was to describe the HPV vaccine and its usefulness in the survivorship population, provide a rationale for describing cancer survivors as being at increased risk for HPV complications, identify factors associated with HPV vaccination, and discuss the utilization of these predictors in designing strategies to promote adherence to HPV vaccination recommendations within the survivorship context."
CD008054,0,11748575,0,Increased incidence of atypical Papanicolaou tests from ThinPreps of postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy.,The authors noticed a significant increase in the rate of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) diagnoses in postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy with ThinPrep (monolayer) Papanicolaou (Pap) tests (8.3%) as compared with conventional Pap tests (2.3%; P = 0.025). The purpose of this study was to correlate these morphologic changes with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection by in situ hybridization and clinical outcome.
CD008054,0,8599925,0,Reporting of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance on cervical smears: is it significant?,"A retrospective 7-mo study (June 1, 1993-December 31, 1993) was performed to evaluate the significance of reporting atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) on cervical smears. During this period 114 (0.7%) of 17,330 smears were diagnosed as ASCUS, 62 of which resulted in either follow-up cervical biopsies and/or endocervical curettages (61%) or repeat smears (39%), and form the basis of this study. Tissue specimens (38 cases) were negative in 24 cases (63%) and were positive in 14 cases (37%). Of the positive specimens, there were 9 low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and 5 high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Repeat smears (24 cases) were negative in 19 cases (79%) and were persistent for a lesion in 5 cases (21%). The persistent lesions consisted of 2 ASCUS and 3 LSIL. Overall, of the 62 cases, 43 (69%) were negative and 19 (31%) showed a lesion on follow-up tissue specimens or smears. Of the 62 cases, ASCUS diagnoses included cellular changes suggestive of human papillomavirus infection in 17 (27%) cases, nondiagnostic cellular changes in 16 (26%) cases, atypical squamous metaplasia vs. a squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) in 15 (24%) cases, inflammatory cell changes vs. a LSIL in 5 (8%) cases, 2 of which contained candida, and atrophic cellular changes in 1 (2%) case. In the remaining 8 (13%) cases, proper cytologic analysis was hampered by partially obscuring acute inflammation (3 cases) and low cellularity (5 cases). The results of this study would indicate that the reporting of ASCUS on cervical smears does lead to the detection of SILs in a significant number of cases (31% in this study). Therefore, further evaluation of the patient is suggested."

CD008054,0,12692113,0,Histopathologic extent of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 lesions in the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion triage study: implications for subject safety and lead-time bias.,"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3) is the precursor of mostsquamous carcinomas and serves as a surrogate end point. However, small CIN3 lesions are rarely associated with concurrent invasion. We hypothesized that aggressive follow-up for cytology of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) leads predominantly to detection of smaller CIN3 lesions than those usually associated with cancer. We assessed this hypothesis in a masked histopathologic review of 330 CIN3 lesions in the ASCUS LSILTriage Study, focusing on ASCUS referrals. ASCUS referrals underwent randomized management [colposcopy for repeat cytology of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), colposcopy for oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) detection or repeat HSIL, or immediate colposcopy]; then all were followed with repeat cytology for 2 years, followed by colposcopy and aggressive treatment. We assessed all CIN3 lesions qualitatively and measured 39 of them. CIN3 lesions were overwhelmingly small. Compared with enrollment, lesions found at follow-up or exit involved fewer tissue fragments (P < 0.01) and showed less diffuse gland involvement (P = 0.03). CIN3 lesions found postenrollment after HPV testing involved the fewest tissue fragments [versus immediate colposcopy (P = 0.04) or repeat cytology of HSIL (P = 0.02)], and none showed diffuse gland involvement. The median distal-proximal length was 6.5 mm (median replacement of total epithelium = 5%) in the 39 measured cases. We conclude that CIN3 lesions underlying ASCUS or LSIL generally lack features associated with invasion, particularly if managed using HPV testing, suggesting that aggressive management leads to early detection of CIN3 but probably prevents relatively few cancers in screened populations."
CD008054,0,18990018,0,Underlying histopathology of HIV-infected women with squamous cell abnormalities on cervical cytology.,"This study was undertaken to evaluate the underlying histopathology of HIV-infected women who had abnormal cervical cytology. HIV-infected women with abnormal cervical cytology undergoing colposcopy at Chiang Mai University Hospital between January 2001 and February 2008 were reviewed. The cohorts were matched and compared with an HIV-negative group. During the study period, 65 HIV-infected women with abnormal cervical cytology were available for review. The abnormal cervical smears were atypical squamous cell (9), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (22), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (27), and squamous cell carcinoma (7). When stratified by severity of abnormal cytology, HIV-infected women had a higher risk of having cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II or higher, whether the cervical smear showed low-grade (P=0.01) or high-grade abnormality (P=0.04) compared with the HIV negative group. After adjustment by age, parity, and menopausal status, HIV-infected women had 2.56 times the risk of having CIN II or higher (69.2% of HIV-infected women compared with 47.7% of HIV negative women; 95% CI=1.21-5.40, P=0.01). In conclusion, HIV-infected women with abnormal Pap smears are a population subset with a higher risk of significant cervical lesions, irrespective of the severity of abnormal cervical smears."
CD008054,0,1335431,0,Prognostic significance of polymerase chain reaction detected human papillomavirus of tumors and lymph nodes in surgically treated stage IB cervical cancer.,"This study describes the prognostic role of polymerase chain reaction detected human papillomavirus (HPV) in Stage IB cervical cancer patients treated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic and paraaortic node dissection. All tumors were confined to the cervix and all margins and nodes were disease free. Twenty-one patients were analyzed: 6 patients recurred within 20 months of initial therapy, while 15 had no evidence of disease with a minimum follow-up of 36 months. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on paraffin-block tissue of the hysterectomy specimen cervical tumor and lymph nodes. Oligonucleotide probes for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35 were used with consensus primers for uncharacterized HPV types created from an L1 constant region. Control tissues were run with each tumor sample to assure against contamination. HPV type confirmation was performed using diagnostic restriction sites. HPV was detected in all cervical tumors. Recurring tumors were infected with multiple types of HPV in all 6 tumors versus only 5 of 15 nonrecurring tumors being multiply infected (P = 0.023). No tumor had HPV 6 or 11, and the incidence of HPV 16, 31, 33, and 35 was not significantly different for recurrent versus nonrecurrent groups. HPV 18 was found in 5 of 6 recurring cancers versus 1 of 15 nonrecurring tumors (P = 0.0029). PCR typing of the histologically negative nodes that had been obtained at radical hysterectomy was done in all 6 recurring patients and in 6 nonrecurring patients. The recurrent patients had a significantly higher incidence of lymph nodes positive for HPV DNA (71%) than the nonrecurring patients (35%) (P = 0.0047). These observations suggest that HPV 18 cervical cancer patients, those with infections of multiple types, and those with HPV DNA in histologically negative lymph nodes may be at increased risk for recurrence."
CD008054,0,20149059,0,Cytogenetic characterization of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines as model systems for the functional analyses of tumor-associated genes.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a solid malignant neoplasm exhibiting aggressive phenotypes and high recurrence rates. To improve its clinical management, understanding the molecular basis of HNSCC development is of critical importance. For the investigation of tumor-associated genes, functional analyses in well-characterized tumor cell systems are required. To establish an experimental platform, a set of 20 HNSCC cell lines was screened for genetic imbalances by chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization (cCGH). Frequent DNA copy number gains were detected on 3q26.3-qter, 5p, 7p11-p13, 8q23-qter, 9p11-p13, 9q31-qter, 11q13 and 20q13.1, whereas copy number losses were found on 3p, 4p, 4q32.1-qter, 8p11-p12 and 18q22 in agreement with previous observations on genetic aberrations detected in primary HNSCC specimens. Subsequent mRNA expression analysis of 11q13 candidate genes CCND1 and CTTN revealed that HNSCC cell lines exhibiting a DNA copy number gain on 11q13 had a higher transcript level of CCND1 and CTTN compared with HNSCC cell lines without 11q13 copy number gain (P = 0.014 and P = 0.009, respectively). Furthermore, CCND1 and CTTN amplification as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization correlated with protein expression as assessed by immunocytochemistry. In summary, the cytogenetic characterization illustrates that this set of HNSCC cell lines is representative for the HNSCC genome and provides tumor model systems for detailed analysis of genes with a possible role in the pathomechanism of head and neck tumors."

Life stress has been implicated in immune decrements in HIV-infected individuals and therefore may contribute to CIN progression over time.

Early detection of the local disease followed immediately by proper treatment is essential to increase the cure and survival rates. Because every NPC tumor cell carries Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) genomes, detection of EBV genomic DNA such as latent membrane protein 1 gene (LMP1) might indicate the presence of NPC. We developed a simple and noninvasive technique of nasopharyngeal swabbing to acquire nasopharyngeal cells for detecting the presence of EBV genome.

CD008054,0,7932399,0,Management of patients with mildly dysplastic cervical smears.,"The management of patients with mild dysplasia on cervical smears remains controversial. Recent studies have shown that many harbor high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and human papillomavirus (HPV) and warrant further evaluation rather than follow-up. This prospective study dealt with the evaluation of patients with mild dysplastic smears using colposcopy and directed biopsies with view to identifying HSIL/HPV and treating them. Among 100 cases studied, 61% revealed HSIL/HPV; of them, 10% had high grades. Hence, patients with mildly dysplastic lesions should be evaluated further and managed with histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen. This protocol may be cost effective for evaluating women with mildly dysplastic smears in a referral center, though it may not be so when compared to a policy of treating the infection, repeating the smears and performing colposcopy and biopsy on all those with persistent abnormality."

CD008054,0,8541389,0,Human papillomavirus-associated malignancies in HIV-positive men and women.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections of the anogenital tract and HPV-associated anogenital neoplasia are commonly found in HIV-positive men and women. Although there is little evidence suggesting that the incidence of invasive cervical cancer is increased in HIV-positive women, the incidence of invasive anal cancer may be increased in HIV-positive men. Among HIV-positive women, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia progresses more rapidly and recurs more often after primary therapy than in HIV-negative women. HPV infection and HPV-associated disease are often multifocal in HIV-positive women, and they may be found in both the vulva and the anus. Cervical cytology appears to be adequate as a screening tool for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in HIV-positive women, but the high recurrence rate and multifocal nature of this disease reinforces the need for careful evaluation and follow-up of the entire anogenital tract in these women."
CD008054,0,15587292,0,[Descriptive study of HPV prevalence in a private consultation].,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the main aethiological factor in the development of squamous cervical neoplasia. Nowadays molecular hybridization is the most adequated method to detect HPV. Study is based on the HPV assay by means of mixed hybridization and capture of specific sequences of viral DNA. Detection of HPV by hybridization and capture is a very useful technique in patients with non-definitive cytologies of viral action, but that display high clinical suspect for such a infection. The cervical cancer screening increases its sensibility and specificity by a combined study of cytology and hibridization. The highest benefit is for those cases classified initially as ASCUS, in which the HPV results point out a more accurate diagnosis and guide subsequent adequate therapy. The results show that for normal cytology up to 87.1% was negative for virus, in the ASCUS group a 56.76% was positive for HPV, in the 32 LSIL cases a 43.8% was negative for HPV, while only a 33% of the HSIL II was negative, finally there were no negative cases for HSIL III, finding an 11.1% for low risk and low plus high risk, and a 77.8% for high risk alone. In spite of the clear relationship between cytology and HPV determination, one must be careful in establishing the treatment for the cases that displayed high risk HPV with cytology within normal limits or ASCUS. We consider these patients as high risk ones thus being suitable for a more strict follow up, keeping more aggressive procedures for the cases with cytologic manifestations."
CD008054,0,10956393,0,IgA antibodies to the 27-kDa heat-shock protein in the genital tracts of women with gynecologic cancers.,"Heat-shock proteins promote cell survival under adverse environmental conditions. Synthesis of the 27-kDa (HSP27), 70-kDa (HSP70), and 90-kDa (HSP90) heat-shock proteins is increased in malignantly transformed cells and has been associated with tumor proliferation, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. The increased expression of heat-shock proteins and their association with tumor-specific antigens may result in local immunity to the heat-shock proteins. We examined the occurrence of IgA antibodies to HSP27, HSP70, and HSP90 in the lower genital tracts of women with possible gynecologic cancers. Cervical samples were obtained from 119 consecutive women being evaluated for a gynecologic malignancy or returning for a follow-up examination following cancer treatment. Aliquots were tested for IgA anti-heat-shock protein antibodies by ELISA. Aliquots were also tested for IgG antibodies to HSP27 as well as for human papillomavirus. Anti-HSP27 IgA was detected in 85.7% of 21 women with endometrial cancer tested prior to diagnosis and in 41.1% of 17 women tested after treatment. In women with ovarian cancer, 77.8% of 9 women tested prior to diagnosis and 75.0% of 24 women evaluated after treatment were anti-HSP27 IgA-positive. Of 6 women with cervical cancer tested prior to diagnosis, 5 were positive for this antibody. None of 25 women with benign diagnoses or 46 healthy women were cervical IgA anti-HSP27-positive (P < 0.0001). In contrast, anti-HSP27 IgG was not associated with a gynecologic malignancy. HSP27 cervical antibodies were not associated with the presence of human papillomavirus. Cervical IgA antibodies to HSP90 were associated with ovarian cancer; antibodies to HSP70 were not cancer-associated. We conclude that cervical IgA antibodies to HSP27 may be indicators of a gynecologic malignancy."
CD008054,0,8804819,0,Gene therapy for head and neck cancer.,"Head and neck cancer continues to present a major therapeutic challenge to physicians. Recent advances in molecular or gene therapy have allowed us to reassess these malignancies and consider novel strategies for their management. Since the first clinical trial 5 years ago, it has become apparent that gene transfer is no longer a speculative approach for treating malignancies. Gene therapy involves the introduction of genetic material (DNA) into host cells to induce the expression of the therapeutic product of that gene. This review summarizes the most recent data concerning the use of gene therapy as a treatment strategy for head and neck solid malignancies. A brief overview of the basic concepts of gene therapy as well as future potential applications is also discussed."

CD008054,0,16284394,0,"Evaluating the risk of cervical precancer with a combination of cytologic, virologic, and visual methods.","Several test modalities (cytologic, molecular, and visual) may be used for cervical cancer screening, triage, and follow-up. Although no currently available single test for cervical neoplasia can detect disease with both high sensitivity and specificity, combinations of available tests allow for improved risk prediction. We therefore evaluated the combination of liquid-based cytology (LBC), human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing, and visual inspection (cervicography), taken at a single point in time, to predict risk of subsequent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3) or cancer developing within 2 years in a triage population of 5,060 women referred for equivocal or mildly abnormal cytology. The concurrent administration of all three test modalities showed that combinations of these test modalities permitted clear and distinct risk stratification. Among HPV-positive women with high-grade LBC and high-grade cervicography results, 79.1 % [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 64.0- 90.0] were diagnosed with histologic CIN3 or cancer within 2 years, supporting a ""see-and-treat"" clinical application. Conversely, only 1.4% (95% CI, 0.7-2.5) of women with a negative HPV, normal cervigram, and second normal cytology result developed CIN3 or cancer. Because this low absolute risk was largely attributable to the negative HPV test, our results suggest a lack of benefit for a secondary or tertiary test result given an HPV-negative test result. Within HPV-positive women, however, we observed a steadily increasing absolute risk for cervical precancer/cancer with increasing numbers and severity of abnormal test results. We conclude that the clear discrimination of cervical cancer risk provided by multiple test modalities is consistent with our understanding of cervical etiology related to HPV natural history."

To address this problem, during 2001-2003, the University of California, San Francisco's (USCF) Vietnamese Community Health Promotion Project collaborated with the Vietnamese Physician Association of Northern California to organize 3 continuing medical education (CME) seminars on cervical cancer for association members. Experts gave lectures and answered questions about screening, diagnosis, and treatment to train physicians to identify risk factors, recommend Pap tests, and evaluate and conduct follow up of abnormal tests. To evaluate the seminars, we administered pre- and post-CME pencil-and-paper questionnaires. Data analysis employing the McNemar chi-squared test demonstrated significant changes in knowledge and understandingfrom pre- to post-CME in multiple areas. Results suggest that CME seminars can significantly increase Vietnamese physicians' knowledge about cervical cancer diagnosis and treatment."

CD008054,0,10471054,0,The molecular genetics of cervical carcinoma.,"In the pathogenesis of cervical carcinoma there are three major components, two of them related to the role of human papillomaviruses (HPV). First, the effect of viral E6 and E7 proteins. Second, the integration of viral DNA in chromosomal regions associated with well known tumour phenotypes. Some of these viral integrations occur recurrently at specific chromosomal locations, such as 8q24 and 12q15, both harbouring HPV18 and HPV16. And third, there are other recurrent genetic alterations not linked to HPV. Recurrent losses of heterozygosity (LOH) have been detected in chromosome regions 3p14-22, 4p16, 5p15, 6p21-22, 11q23, 17p13.3 without effect on p53, 18q12-22 and 19q13, all of them suggesting the alteration of putative tumour suppressor genes not yet identified. Recurrent amplification has been mapped to 3q+ arm, with the common region in 3q24-28 in 90% of invasive carcinomas. The mutator phenotype, microsatellite instability, plays a minor role and is detected in only 7% of cervical carcinomas. The development of cervical carcinoma requires the sequential occurrence and selection of several genetic alterations. The identification of the specific genes involved, and their correlation with specific tumour properties and stages could improve the understanding and perhaps the management of cervical carcinoma."

Factors associated with knowledge and attitudes were also addressed with a questionnaire. Seventy eight women (26%) had heard about the HPV virus and 65 about HPV vaccines (21.7%). Marital status was associated significantly with awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine (p=0.002, p=0.002; respectively), in addition to level of education (p=0.042). The percentages of women who reported correct answers for the questions on knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccine ranged from 12% to 25%. One hundred fifty nine respondents (53%) had a positive attitude toward HPV vaccination. Age, marital status, and level of education were associated significantly with attitude (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.002; respectively). The most important barriers reported were 'unawareness of the vaccine' 'concerned about side effects' and 'afraid of needles'. This study found a very low level of knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccine.

CD008054,0,12509096,0,Management of women with cervical cancer precursor lesions.,"An understanding of the natural history of HPV-induced precancer and cancer, and of the immune response to HPV and to these lesions, has significantly changed the management of lower genital tract neoplasia. New management guidelines incorporate this understanding, providing a more rational approach to diagnosis and treatment. Understanding that low-grade HPV-induced lesions are not true cervical cancer precursor has fostered expectant management of women with these lesions; however, management approaches are still hampered by the inability to better predict who is at risk for high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer and who is not; this is particularly problematic in the expectant management of CIN 1. In addition, the decision whether or not to treat these low-grade lesions may depend on a number of complex factors that take into account the woman's preferences and reliability for follow-up, as well as a host of issues related to costs and the reliability of the original diagnosis and the tests used for follow-up. Management options for high-grade cervical cancer precursor lesions are much more definitive, because the option of expectant management is given except in pregnancy and for adolescents with CIN 2. New markers that better predict which women with high-risk HPV are at highest risk for subsequent development of a true cervical cancer precursor lesion appear to be on the horizon and may make the management of low-grade lesions as clear as present guide lines for their high-grade cousins. Until that time, understanding all the issues involved in expectant and in active management of cervical HPV-induced lesions will help provide women with the best care possible."

In the meantime, a better understanding and utilization of the technologies at hand will result in a successful, organized approach to the detection of early cervical cancer and its precursors [56]. The adoption of any new screening technologies must result in a documented reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer. Until then, colposcopy and HPV DNA testing when indicated appears to remain as the undisputed gold standard in the evaluation of the patient at risk."

CD008054,0,15902326,0,[Activity of the National Oncology R&D Consortium in 2004].,We have prepared the map of regional distribution of cervical cancer in Hungary. Serial HPV genotyping of sexual partners provided evidence for the sexually transmitted infections. Molecular epidemiology studies revealed activating c-kit mutation in bilateral testicular cancers. A cost-effective molecular staging method was introduced to the management of breast cancer patients. Genomic profiling identified the gene signature of Herceptin and taxane sensitivity of breast cancer. In colon cancer patients we have determined the mutational spectrum of hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes in Hungary. The prognostic power of SHMT and MTHFR polymorphism was determined in colorectal cancer patients. In head and neck cancer the gene signature of cisplatin sensitivity and the EGFR polymorphism was determined. We have introduced a cost-effective in vitro assay to determine the drug resistance of pediatric leukemias. The prognostic power of N-myc genotyping was determined in neuroblastoma patients. A phase I trial for gene therapy of brain cancer was started by using a GM-CSF adenoviral vector system. Using global genomic approaches the gene signature of malignant melanoma and its metastatic disease was determined.

CD008054,0,20661011,0,Using biomarkers as objective standards in the diagnosis of cervical biopsies.,"Histopathologic diagnosis of cervical biopsies determines clinical management of patients with an abnormal cervical cancer-screening test yet is prone to poor interobserver reproducibility. Immunohistochemical staining for biomarkers related to the different stages of cervical carcinogenesis may provide objective standards to reduce diagnostic variability of cervical biopsy evaluations but systematic, rigorous evaluations of their potential clinical utility are lacking. To address diagnostic utility of human papillomavirus (HPV) L1, p16(INK4a), and Ki-67 immunohistochemical staining for improving diagnostic accuracy, we conducted a community-based and population-based evaluation using 1455 consecutive cervical biopsies submitted to the Department of Pathology at the University of Virginia during a period of 14 months. Thin-sections of each biopsy from 1451 of 1455 (99.7%) biopsies underwent evaluation of immunohistochemical stains for the 3 biomarkers, masked to the original diagnosis, and the results were compared with an adjudicated, consensus diagnosis by 3 pathologists. p16 immunostaining, using the strongest staining as the cutpoint, was 86.7% sensitive and 82.8% specific for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or more severe (CIN2(+)) diagnoses. The performance of p16(INK4a) was more sensitive (P<0.001), less specific (P<0.001), and of similar overall accuracy for CIN2(+) compared with the combined performance of all pathologist reviews in routine clinical diagnostic service (sensitivity=68.9%, specificity=97.2%). Ki-67 immunostaining was also strongly associated with a CIN2(+) diagnosis but its performance at all staining intensities was inferior to p16 immunostaining, and did not increase the accuracy of CIN2(+) diagnosis when combined with p16(INK4a) immunostaining compared with p16(INK4a) immunostaining alone. We found no utility for L1 immunostaining in distinguishing between CIN and non-CIN. In conclusion, with a rigorous evaluation, we found immunohistochemical staining for p16 to be a useful and reliable diagnostic adjunct for distinguishing biopsies with and without CIN2(+)."
CD008054,0,20626752,0,Tobacco smoking and regression of low-grade cervical abnormalities.,"The role of tobacco smoking in the multistage carcinogenesis at the cervix is not fully understood because of a paucity of prospective data. To assess the relationship between smoking and spontaneous regression of cervical precursor lesions, a total of 516 women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) were monitored by cytology and colposcopy every 4 months. Probability of LSIL regression within 2 years was analyzed in relation to smoking behaviors, with regression defined as at least two consecutive negative Pap smears and normal colposcopy. Women's age, initial biopsy results, and human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes were included in the multivariate models for adjustments. Our study subjects included 258 never-smokers and 258 smokers (179 current and 79 former smokers). During a mean follow-up time of 39.8 months, 320 lesions regressed to normal cytology. Probability of regression within 2 years was significantly lower in smokers than in never-smokers (55.0%vs 68.8%, P = 0.004). The risk of LSIL persistence increased with smoking intensity and duration and with younger age at starting smoking (P = 0.003, P < 0.001, and P = 0.03, respectively). Smokers had twice as high a risk of persistent HPV infection compared to never-smokers (odds ratio, 2.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-4.81; P = 0.006). In young women, passive smoking since childhood reduced probability of regression within 2 years (56.7%vs 85.9%, P < 0.001). Further adjustments for a wide range of cervical cancer risk factors did not change the findings. In conclusion, tobacco smoking may interfere with regression of cervical precursor lesions. Childhood exposure to second-hand smoke may increase a risk of persistent cervical abnormalities among young women."

CD008054,0,17826171,0,Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, and knowledge regarding its cause and pathogenesis is expanding rapidly. Persistent infection with one of about 15 genotypes of carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) causes almost all cases. There are four major steps in cervical cancer development: infection of metaplastic epithelium at the cervical transformation zone, viral persistence, progression of persistently infected epithelium to cervical precancer, and invasion through the basement membrane of the epithelium. Infection is extremely common in young women in their first decade of sexual activity. Persistent infections and precancer are established, typically within 5-10 years, from less than 10% of new infections. Invasive cancer arises over many years, even decades, in a minority of women with precancer, with a peak or plateau in risk at about 35-55 years of age. Each genotype of HPV acts as an independent infection, with differing carcinogenic risks linked to evolutionary species. Our understanding has led to improved prevention and clinical management strategies, including improved screening tests and vaccines. The new HPV-oriented model of cervical carcinogenesis should gradually replace older morphological models based only on cytology and histology. If applied wisely, HPV-related technology can minimise the incidence of cervical cancer, and the morbidity and mortality it causes, even in low-resource settings."

Paraffin-embedded specimens of secondary H/N cancer (11), secondary gastric cancer (6) and their corresponding NPC specimens were examined by EBER in situ hybridization to assess the association between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and these SMTs. Twenty-six primary H/N and 5 gastric cancer specimens were chosen as the control groups. In H/N cancer, EBV was detected in 3.8% of the primary cancers and 9.1% of the secondary cancers. All the positive specimens resulted from hypopharyngeal cancer. Of the secondary gastric cancers, only 1 case (16.6%) was associated with EBV. None of the primary gastric cancers was associated with EBV. Our results indicate an increased risk of developing SMTs, with a preference for head and neck cancer, gastric cancer and leukemia, in NPC patients after RT in Taiwan. Only a small proportion of the secondary H/N and gastric cancers was associated with EBV."
CD008054,0,19405865,0,Influence of loop electrosurgical excision procedure on subsequent acquisition of new human papillomavirus infections.,The impact of loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) treatment for cervical precancerous lesions on subsequent acquisition of new human papillomavirus (HPV) infections is not well described.
CD008054,0,19620947,0,Does Epstein-Barr virus play a role in lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the uterine cervix?,"The role of Epstein-Barr viruses (EBVs) in lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) of the uterine cervix is controversial. We aimed to investigate the existence of EBV and human papillomavirus (HPV) in LELC of the cervix. Nine patients of LELC of the cervix, treated at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 1996 and 2000, with complete clinicopathologic findings and follow-up data were studied. Twenty-five patients with squamous cell carcinoma were recruited as controls. The EBV genome was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. HPV genotyping was carried out by SPF1/GP6+ PCR and hybridization with a GeneChip. Type-specific E6 PCR of the 18 most commonly found HPV genotypes in Taiwan was also performed. HPV-16 was found in 3 cases, HPV-18, HPV-31, and HPV-35, and HPV-58 in 1 case each. One case showed positive for both HPV-16 and HPV-58. Low copy number of EBV DNA was found in 9 cases of LELC (1-14.7 copies/microg) and 7 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (3.8-1586 copies/microg) using real-time quantitative PCR Bam H1 W fragment probe, but EBV-encoded RNA-in situ hybridization was negative in tumor cells. Therefore, positive rates for EBV and HPV were 0% and 88.9% (8/9) in LELC of the cervix, respectively. All patients with LELC of the cervix had no evidence of disease for more than 5 years from diagnoses. Our results suggest that EBV is not involved in the carcinogenesis of so-called LELC of the cervix but the EBV sequences might exist in a florid inflammatory stromal component."
CD008054,0,19620946,1,Human papillomavirus-specific genotypes in cervical lesions of women referred for smears with atypical glandular cells or adenocarcinoma in situ.,"This study was designed to analyze whether specific human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes may predict histologic outcomes in women with glandular abnormalities in their cervical smears. Of the 160 women included, 111 were diagnosed with atypical glandular cells, 35 had both atypical glandular cells and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, whereas 14 women had AIS, in 1 case associated with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. All women underwent colposcopic examinations and biopsy was performed in 129/160 (80.6%). Thirty-one women (19.3%) were considered negative for neoplasia and scheduled for follow-up. All specimens were tested for 27 HPV genotypes by Roche's polymerase chain reaction-reverse line blot assay. Histologic diagnoses were either cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive carcinoma in 75 (58%) women, and negative for neoplasia in 54 (42%). The overall prevalence of HPV was 43%. HPV 16 was the most prevalent type followed by HPV 18. HPV 16 was significantly associated with squamous and glandular neoplasia and HPV 18 with glandular neoplasia. In women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3, 11 different HPV genotypes were found, whereas in those who had invasive glandular or invasive carcinoma HPV 16 and HPV 18 were found predominantly. The detection of HPV 16 in women with glandular abnormalities in cervical smears did not help differentiating squamous from glandular lesions. However, the detection of HPV 53 in abnormal smears can predict squamous neoplasia, whereas HPV 18 can predict glandular neoplasia as histologic diagnoses."

CD008054,0,21213526,0,Management of pre-invasive cervical cancer in low-resource setting.,"Cervical cancer is one of the health burdens in many developing countries. The advanced knowledge in the past decade reassured the important role of human papillomavirus as the necessary cause of cervical cancer and makes a clear understanding of its natural history. Cervical cancer has a long period of pre-invasive stage, and only a small proportion of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) that can progress to be an invasive lesion. Appropriate management of CIN can prevent invasive cervical cancer. The contemporary treatment of CIN is more conservative and requires effective follow-up process. However inappropriate management of CIN is still be found at the international and national survey of less developed countries. Although no apparent superior surgical technique for treating CIN, loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and cryotherapy are fascinated for the low-resource setting. Other alternative approach, which eliminates cytology and colposcopy may be considered in the ultrashort- resource setting with a high prevalence of cervical cancer. In this article, the contemporary knowledge about the natural history of cervical cancer, especially the implication of human papillomavirus (HPV) for pre-invasive cervical cancer, is summarized. The current approaches for treatment of CIN are reviewed from the perspective of low-resource settings. The various strategies for management approaches are demonstrated, and the cost-effectiveness is discussed. The pattern of pre-invasive cervical cancer management in developing countries, including in the south of Thailand is exhibited, and the single-visit service for cervical cancer prevention in the northeast is challenged."
CD008054,0,18528890,1,Are adjunctive markers useful in routine cervical cancer screening? Application of p16(INK4a) and HPV-PCR on ThinPrep samples with histological follow-up.,"The objectives of the study were to evaluate 1) the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of p16(INK4a) as a marker for high-grade cervical lesions, 2) the results of a real-time polymerase chain reaction detecting high-risk human papillomavirus, and 3) the interobserver variability of the p16(INK4a) interpretation.A total of 232 ThinPrep samples were stained for p16(INK4a), and HPV-DNA PCR was performed on 107 specimens with inclusion of both benign and abnormal cytology. Histological follow-up information was collected. The diagnostic sensitivity of ASC+ with CIN2+ in histology as endpoint was 96% for p16(INK4a) and 100% for HR-HPV DNA PCR, and the diagnostic specificity was 41% and 27%, respectively. If p16(INK4a) had been used for triage of the ASC samples, then 18 patients (42%) could have been spared unnecessary follow-up procedures compared to six patients (21%) with the HR-HPV DNA test."
CD008054,0,12492081,0,Gene therapy for head and neck cancer.,"Head and neck cancer, because of its anatomic accessibility and poor overall survival rate, has become a frequent target of novel gene therapy intervention strategies. Viral and nonviral vectors have been used to transfer a variety of tumor suppressor genes, suicide genes, and immunologic genes into head and neck cancer cells in both the laboratory and clinical setting. Gene therapy as an isolated treatment modality will probably not replace standard treatment modalities in the management of head and neck cancer. It seems likely, however, that gene transfer will find its way into the multidisciplinary care of the head and neck cancer patient, where novel treatments are combined with standard therapies in order to maximize tumor response."

The inconvenience of current methods limits their acceptability and leads to higher user failure rates. New methods, such as female condoms, nonlatex male condoms, and new cervical caps are being developed: the Reality (Wisconsin Pharmacal, Jackson, WI) polyurethane vaginal pouch has already received conditional Food and Drug Administration approval for use in the United States. The material used in a Food and Drug Administration-approved nonallergenic glove is being tested for its effectiveness as a condom. In addition, the Fem Cap, a cervical cap that had a life table probability of failure within 1 year of 4.8%, is expected to be available within the next 2 years. It is important for clinicians to be informed of new options becoming available for those patients who may be good candidates for these barrier methods."
CD008054,0,18528899,0,Identification of the rare EGFR mutation p.G796S as somatic and germline mutation in white patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.,Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are involved in tumorigenesis and response to targeted therapies in distinct cancer types. Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) show an incidence of EGFR mutations varying from 7% in Asians to 0% to 4% in white patients. Mutational screening predominantly focuses on the analysis of hotspot regions of EGFR (exons 19 and 21).
CD008054,0,20451455,0,HPV-associated head and neck cancer: a virus-related cancer epidemic.,"A rise in incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer--specifically of the lingual and palatine tonsils--in white men younger than age 50 years who have no history of alcohol or tobacco use has been recorded over the past decade. This malignant disease is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 infection. The biology of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer is distinct with P53 degradation, retinoblastoma RB pathway inactivation, and P16 upregulation. By contrast, tobacco-related oropharyngeal cancer is characterised by TP53 mutation and downregulation of CDKN2A (encoding P16). The best method to detect virus in tumour is controversial, and both in-situ hybridisation and PCR are commonly used; P16 immunohistochemistry could serve as a potential surrogate marker. HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer seems to be more responsive to chemotherapy and radiation than HPV-negative disease. HPV 16 is a prognostic marker for enhanced overall and disease-free survival, but its use as a predictive marker has not yet been proven. Many questions about the natural history of oral HPV infection remain under investigation. For example, why does the increase in HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer dominate in men? What is the potential of HPV vaccines for primary prevention? Could an accurate method to detect HPV in tumour be developed? Which treatment strategies reduce toxic effects without compromising survival? Our aim with this review is to highlight current understanding of the epidemiology, biology, detection, and management of HPV-related oropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and to describe unresolved issues."
CD008054,0,16445642,1,Role of human papillomavirus DNA testing in management of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance.,"To find the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the high-risk group human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing as a triage tool to detect high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs, ie, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 2 or worse) in women with a cytologic smear showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). All new cases with cytologic smears showing ASC-US that presented in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January 2003 to November 2003, excluding known cases of HSILs and pregnancies, were enrolled. Cervical cell samplings were done by cervical cytobrush technique and tested for high-risk group HPV with the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) test. All participants were examined under a colposcope. Then cervicographs were taken before colposcopic-directed cervical biopsies were done. Of the 90 ASC-US cases enrolled, the pathologic results were normal in 30.0%, squamous metaplasia in 16.7%, CIN 1 in 37.8%, CIN 2 in 1.1%, CIN 3 in 11.1%, and microinvasive cervical carcinoma in 3.3%. The prevalence of HSILs and the prevalence of high-risk HPV detection were 15.6% and 38.9%, respectively. Using pathologic results from cervical biopsy as the gold standard, the HC2 has the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 85.7%, 69.7%, 34.3%, and 96.4%, respectively, to detect HSILs. High-risk group HPV detection can be used as an additional triage test to detect HSILs in women having ASC-US with high sensitivity and negative predictive value."

Oncogenic HPV types were present in 10.8% of control women and in 31/33 of the carcinoma cases, corresponding to an odds ratio of 130.6 (95% CI 11.7-1457.0). There was no significant difference in risk between prevalent cancer cases (diagnosed less than 3 months after HPV testing) and incident cases (diagnosed an average of 2.1 years later). HPV 16 and 18 were the most prevalent oncogenic HPV types present. The results confirm that some two of three of cervical cancer cases in this population of Northeast Thailand are caused by HPV 16 and 18."
CD008054,0,11005244,0,Clinical applications of image cytometry to human tumour analysis.,"Image cytometry (ICM) is widely applied to the automated screening, the detection, the diagnosis, the classification, the prognosis and the therapeutic follow-up of different types of cancers (breast, bladder, cervix,...). This review describes the analysis methods and the applications of nuclear image analysis, the determination of DNA content and the analysis of morphometry and of nuclear texture. DNA content analysis can contribute to a prognostic information in addition to other prognostic factors for breast, renal and prostate cancers. For ovarian cancer, aneuploidy seems to be related to prognosis. Bladder tumours with DNA aneuploidy were frequently of high malignancy while ploidy was significantly correlated to relapse risk. For digestive cancers, patients presenting DNA diploid tumours show a better survival than patients with aneuploid ones. Morphometry seems to be a more important criterion than other conventional prognostic factors of invasive breast and digestive carcinomas. A differential diagnosis between normal and neoplastic thyroids is more precise when based on a quantitative evaluation of texture associated to morphometry. Textural parameters permit the discrimination of two populations of patients having a different prognosis and could thus be an aid for prognosis in prostatic cancers. Morphonuclear parameters contribute to separate low and high grade bladder carcinomas. Although ICM was frequently reported, results from the reported examples were not always obvious. In conclusion, the measurements obtained with ICM could be helpful for a decision in several cancers but could not be a substitute for the classical approach of the pathologist."
CD008054,0,17582921,0,"Human papillomavirus vaccine for genotypes 6, 11, 16 and 18: new drug. Cervical cancer prevention: high hopes...","(1) Most cases of high-grade anogenital dysplasia and malignancy are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes 16 and 18. Anogenital papilloma and condyloma acuminata are mainly caused by HPV6 and HPV11. (2) A recombinant vaccine covering these four genotypes is now marketed in the European Union for the prevention of condyloma, precancerous lesions, and cancers of the female lower genital tract. (3) A three-dose vaccination schedule (0, 2 and 6 months) elicits an immune response in almost all women, but the minimum antibody titre required for clinical protection is not known. Immune protection lasts at least 5 years, but no one knows what happens after that time. (4) Three double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trials involving a total of about 18 000 women aged 16 to 23 had sufficiently similar designs to pool results for analysis. Nearly all (around 98%) of women not yet infected with papillomavirus of a genotype covered by the vaccine were protected from dysplasia caused by one of these genotypes. The vaccine did not affect dysplasia caused by other genotypes, nor was it effective in women who were already infected. In total, among women not yet infected with a papillomavirus genotype covered by the vaccine, the vaccine prevented about 38% of high-grade dysplasias of all types (0.5 versus 0.8 cases per 100 woman-years). (5) The vaccine also markedly reduced the incidence of genital warts and high-grade vulvar and vaginal dysplasia. There are no data on efficacy beyond 4.5 years. (6) These results are somewhat undermined by methodological problems, such as follow-up lasting only a maximum of 4.5 years whereas cervical cancer takes much longer to develop. In addition, there were very few cases of dysplasia in each trial, and results were largely based on post hoc subgroup analyses. (7) Apart from local reactions, which occurred in more than 80% of vaccinated women, the only adverse effect of papillomavirus vaccination was fever (12.9% of those on the vaccine versus 11% on placebo). (8) There is no evidence thus far that prenatal exposure due to HPV vaccination during the month preceding conception is harmful. (9) The clinical results are promising but further follow-up is needed to answer ongoing questions, such as the incidence of cervical cancer after vaccination and the duration of protection. Cervical cancer screening remains necessary, even for vaccinated women, and a continued need exists for measures designed to prevent all sexually transmitted diseases."
CD008054,0,18547207,0,Assessing mandatory HPV vaccination: who should call the shots?,"In 2007, many legislatures considered, and two enacted, bills mandating HPV vaccination for young girls as a condition of school attendance. Such mandates raise significant legal, ethical, and social concerns. This paper argues that mandating HPV vaccination for minor females is premature since long-term safety and effectiveness of the vaccine has not been established, HPV does not pose imminent and significant risk of harm to others, a sex specific mandate raises constitutional concerns, and a mandate will burden financially existing government health programs and private physicians. Absent careful consideration and public conversation, HPV mandates may undermine coverage rates for other vaccines."
CD008054,0,18418881,1,Immunocytochemical staining of p16(ink4a) protein as an adjunct test in equivocal liquid-based cytology.,"For cervical cancer screening, HPV-DNA test is expensive and is not easily available in all clinical situations. Thus, we investigated the role of p16(ink4a) immunostaining as another adjunct test to diagnose cervical neoplasia in equivocal liquid based cytology. Eighty-seven patients were randomly selected for this study (3 patients with normal, 84 patients with abnormal including 24 ASCUS, 30 LSIL, and 30 HSIL). We performed p16(ink4a) immunostaining on ThinPrep slide and on each case from the corresponding cervical biopsy tissues. High-risk HPV-DNA testing was also performed on all the subjects. We found that the immunoreactivity of p16(ink4a) is strongly correlated with the grade of cytologic and histologic diagnoses as well as with Hybrid Capture 2. In comparing the p16(ink4a) immunostaining with the Hybrid Capture 2 for accuracy of the diagnosis of CIN II/III or a higher-grade disease in the case of ASCUS/LSIL on ThinPrep, no significant differences were observed. Our data implies that p16(ink4a) immunocytochemical staining in liquid-based cytology specimens might be used as a good adjunct test to predict cervical histology in equivocal ThinPrep tests."

CD008054,0,18595876,1,Linear array genotyping and hybrid capture II assay in detecting human papillomavirus genotypes in women referred for colposcopy due to abnormal Papanicolaou smear.,"The main objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping in women referred for colposcopy due to abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smear. A series of 248 women referred for colposcopy due to an abnormal Pap smear were analysed with the Roche Linear Array HPV genotyping test detecting 37 most frequent HPV types, and compared with hybrid capture II (HCII) assay for oncogenic (high-risk [HR] HPV) types as well as for p16INK4a expression using immunocytochemistry. All tests were performed in cervical samples collected in PreservCyt liquid media for liquid-based cytology (ThinPrep), and colposcopic biopsy and/or loop electro excision procedure cone biopsy was used as the gold standard. HPV16 was the single most frequent genotype (29/258; 11.7%), followed by HPV51 (4.4%), HPV66 (3.6%), HPV42, 52 and 56 (3.2% for all). Linear array genotyping test significantly predicts both abnormal colposcopy (odds ratio [OR] = 9.0; 3.12-25.93), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (OR = 9.6; 1.26-74.17) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3+ (OR = 29.3; 3.95-218.06). In detecting CIN3, linear array was equivalent (97.6%) to colposcopy in sensitivity (SE), both being superior to HCII (92.7%). Concordance between linear array and HCII was moderate (Cohen's kappa kappa = 0.547; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.435-659). Specificity (SP) and positive predictive value (PPV) of linear array were significantly improved, if only HPV16 genotype was considered. Performance in the best balance is obtained, when linear array and colposcopy are combined, giving 82.9% SE, 93.9% SP, 73.9% PPV and 96.3% negative predictive value (NPV) as predictor of CIN3+ (OR 74.5; 95% CI: 27.36-202.72). In conclusion, linear array for HR-HPV is a highly sensitive test (97.6%) with high NPV (98.9%) in detecting CIN3+ lesions. HPV16 genotyping alone significantly improves SP and PPV of this test in management of women with abnormal cytology."

CD008054,0,18595872,0,Management of internal genital warts: do we all agree? A postal survey.,"A postal survey was undertaken to determine whether there was any consensus of opinion regarding the management of internal genital warts in genitourinary medicine clinics in the UK. Overall, 110 forms were returned (57% response). The majority of clinics would refer patients with cervical warts for colposcopy especially if the patient was over the age of 25 or HIV-positive. Proctoscopy or anoscopy was performed in 60% of clinics for patients with perianal warts to determine the presence of warts within the anal canal or rectum. Only 24% of patients with intra-anal warts are referred directly to surgery for biopsy, increasing to 61% if the patient has HIV infection. Cryotherapy is the main treatment for all types of internal warts. Our findings suggest there is no consensus and we recommend that all HIV-positive patients with anal or cervical condyloma should be investigated for evidence of intraepithelial neoplasia."
CD008054,0,11704181,0,The management of ASCUS cervical cytologic abnormalities and HPV testing: a cautionary note.,"A recently published study of the management of low-grade cytologic smears compared immediate colposcopy to human papillomavirus (HPV) triage and entry cytology smears (conservative management) as three triage techniques for managing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) smears (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study [ALTS]). The study reported a high sensitivity (96.3%) for HPV testing using hybrid capture 2 to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III. The authors concluded that HPV testing is a viable option for managing ASCUS smears. We have reviewed the published data from the ALTS trial and have found a large excess of colposcopies and biopsies in the HPV arm in comparison with the conservative management (cytology) arm. In addition, the ALTS trial quality control and pathology review results raise doubts about the diagnostic validity of the study to establish standards of clinical practice. Furthermore, until the 2-year follow-up analysis of the conservative management arm is completed to detect CIN III, a valid comparison between HPV triage and conservative management is not possible. We conclude that, based on published data, HPV testing for routine clinical management of low-grade cytologic abnormalities (ASCUS smears) is not warranted, and that HPV testing is currently an investigational tool."

CD008054,0,10542944,0,Prognostic factors in Paget's disease of the vulva: a study of 21 cases.,"Twenty-one cases of vulvar Paget's disease were studied to assess possible prognostic indicators, including presence and depth of invasion, status of resection margins, tumor DNA cell content, and immunoreactivity for p53 and estrogen receptor proteins. Immunostaining for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), and gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP) were also performed. Patients were 45 to 82 years of age (mean, 66.9 years). Ten of 21 patients (47.6%) had invasive Paget's disease. Dermal invasion was < or = 1 mm in 7 of 10 cases and 2 mm, 3 mm, and 8 mm in the remaining three invasive tumors. Of the seven patients with minimally invasive Paget's disease (< or = 1 mm depth of invasion), five are alive with no evidence of disease, one died of an unrelated illness, and one is alive with biopsy-proven in situ Paget's disease, having refused operative treatment. Of the three patients with more than minimally invasive Paget's disease (> 1 mm), all had nodal metastases; one patient is alive with no evidence of disease, one died of undertermined causes, and one died of metastatic Paget's disease. The remaining 11 patients had Paget's disease confined to the epidermis and its adnexal structures. Seven of these patients were alive at last follow-up with no evidence of disease. Of the remaining four patients, one died of metastatic cervical cancer, one died of metastatic bladder cancer, one died of an unrelated illness, and one patient is alive with biopsy-proven in situ Paget's disease and awaiting operative treatment. Twenty of the 21 cases represented primary vulvar Paget's disease while one represented possible local spread from a cervical adenocarcinoma. The immunoprofiles were GCDFP+/CK7+/CK20- in 14 cases, GCDFP+/CK7+/CK20+ in 4 cases, and GCDFP-/CK7+/CK20- in 2 cases. All tumors were estrogen receptor-negative. Immunostaining for p53 was positive in 16 tumors and negative in four tumors. Seven of 12 (58%) patients with positive margins experienced local recurrence of Paget's disease, while the disease recurred in 1 of 4 patients with negative margins. Recurrence was observed in 3 of 5 patients with diploid tumors and in 4 of 10 patients with aneuploid tumors. Neither of these differences is statistically significant. This study supports the recognition of a category of minimally invasive vulvar Paget's disease that has a low risk of distant metastasis and death caused by disease. Status of surgical resection margins, tumor cell DNA ploidy, estrogen receptor expression, and p53 immunoreactivity are not predictive of local recurrence."
CD008054,0,14750245,1,Atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance. Outcome predictions based on human papillomavirus testing.,"Cases of atypical glandular cells (AGC) diagnosed on liquid-based preparations were culled from a 3-year period. When available, residual cellular material was analyzed for human papillomavirus (HPV) by polymerase chain reaction and correlated with cytologic and histologic (biopsy) outcome. Of 178,994 cytologic cases, 187 (0.1045%) contained AGC compared with 8,740 (4.8828%) atypical squamous cells (ASC) for an AGC/ASC ratio of 0.021. HPV results and follow-up were available for 108 specimens from 106 patients. Depending on the end-point (histologic/cyto-logic), the sensitivity range of HPV testing for significant cervical disease (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [SIL], adenocarcinoma in situ [ACIS], invasive carcinoma) was 83% with a specificity range of 78% to 82%, a positive predictive value of 57% to 61%, and a negative predictive value of 91% to 95%. Fifteen false-positive results included concurrent ASC or low-grade SIL, ASC on follow-up cytology, and previous ACIS with a negative follow-up cone biopsy result. Noncervical glandular neoplasia (including atypical endometrial hyperplasia) was confirmed in 13 cases (1 recurrent), only 2 of which scored positive for HPV. HPV-positive AGC has a substantially higher positive predictive value for significant disease than ASC (61% vs historic 20%) and merits consideration in the triage of patients with atypical endocervical cells not otherwise specified. However, noncervical or other HPV-negative glandular neoplasia must be considered in all patients with AGC, particularly older patients."

We compared the positivity rate of the commercially available HPV DNA method hybrid capture 2 (hc2) and the commercially available E6/E7 mRNA method PreTect HPV-Proofer in cytological specimens (n=299). LBC specimens collected (n=299) represented the following cervical cytological disease categories: Normal (n=60), borderline nuclear abnormalities (BNA) (n=34), CIN1 (n=121), CIN2 (n=60), CIN3 (n=24). Overall, 69% (205/299) of the cases were positive by hc2 and 38% (112/299) of the cases were positive by PreTect HPV-Proofer. Concordance rates between the two tests were highest in the high-grade cytology cases (CIN2: 67% and CIN3: 83%) and the normal cytology cases (88%) and lowest in the BNA and CIN1 categories (56% and 52%). HPV DNA viral load analyses were carried out on HPV16 (n=55), HPV18 (n=9) and HPV33 (n=13) samples that were positive by PreTect HPV-Proofer. The sensitivity and specificity of PreTect HPV-Proofer and the hc2 DNA test for the detection of high-grade cytology (i.e. CIN2+) were 71.4% and 75.8% vs 100% and 43.7%, respectively. The relatively low detection rate observed by PreTect HPV-Proofer in the whole range of cytological positive cases, combined with a relatively higher specificity and PPV, suggests that PreTect HPV-Proofer may be more useful than hc2 for triage and in predicting high-grade disease."

CD008054,0,12807953,0,Chapter 15: Public health policy and cost-effectiveness analysis.,"Recent scientific advances are providing an opportunity to revisit strategies for cervical cancer prevention. How to invest health resources wisely, such that public health benefits are maximized-and opportunity costs are minimized-is a critical question in the setting of enhanced cytologic screening methods, human papillomavirus DNA testing, and vaccine development. Developing sound clinical guidelines and public health policy will require careful consideration of the incremental benefits, harms, and costs associated with new interventions compared with existing interventions, at both an individual and a population level. In addition to an intervention's effectiveness, public health decision making requires the consideration of its feasibility, sustainability, and affordability. No clinical trial or single cohort study will be able to simultaneously consider all of these components. Cost-effectiveness analysis and disease-simulation modeling, capitalizing on data from multiple sources, can serve as a valuable tool to extend the time horizon of clinical trials, to evaluate more strategies than possible in a single clinical trial, and to assess the relative costs and benefits of alternative policies to reduce mortality from cervical cancer."

CD008054,0,12838310,0,Clinical and economic benefit of HPV-load testing in follow-up and management of women postcone biopsy for CIN2-3.,This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and economic implications of integrating human papilloma virus (HPV) load testing into the follow-up and management protocol of women postconisation for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2-3). We evaluated 130 suitable women: 63 were screened biannually by Pap smears ('conventional approach') and 67 also had HPV-load testing ('HPV approach'). More stringent criteria for undergoing colposcopy or reconisation were observed by the former group compared to the latter. Both approaches were analysed for cost effectiveness. There were 33 out of 67 (49.2%) colposcopic referrals and 24 out of 67 (35.8%) reconisation/hysterectomies with the 'conventional approach' compared to 9 out of 63 (14.2%) and 7 out of 63 (11.1%) with the 'HPV approach'. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2-3 residual disease was detected in 7 out of 67 (10.5%) and 7 out of 63 (11.1%) women. The 'conventional approach' had more negative colposcopic biopsies and more negative reconisation/hysterectomy histologies than the 'HPV approach'. The respective cost per detection of one case of residual disease was US$3573 and US$3485. The 'HPV approach' required fewer colposcopic and reconisation procedures to detect one case of residual CIN2-3. Its higher positive predictive value than that of cytology provided a significant decrease in false positive rates and a reduction of US$88 per detected case.

CD008054,0,17885498,0,Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix with marked cytological atypia-clinical follow-up and human papillomavirus genotyping.,"The majority of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) of the cervix regress spontaneously; however, a small proportion of LSILs progress to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) if the lesion is not excised. The guidelines for which patients with LSIL should be treated and which may be followed safely are not well established. The goal of this study was to identify a subgroup of patients with LSIL who may require surgical treatment. We hypothesized that patients with LSILs with marked cytological atypia (LSIL-MA) may be at higher risk for subsequent HSIL. In addition, we were interested in whether LSIL-MA was associated with specific human papillomavirus genotypes. Consecutive patients with biopsy diagnosis of LSIL (n = 30) and LSIL-MA (n = 30) were identified. Marked atypia was defined as 5 or more cells with nuclear enlargement of at least 5 times the size of an intermediate cell nucleus or multinucleation with 5 or more nuclei. Patient follow-up was recorded for up to 24 months. Human papillomavirus genotyping was performed using SPF10 PCR and line probe assay. High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion on follow-up was significantly more common in patients with LSIL-MA (36%) than in patients with LSIL (7%), and negative follow-up was significantly more common in patients with LSIL (50%) than LSIL-MA (23%). Cases of LSIL and LSIL-MA showed similar spectrum of human papillomavirus genotypes. Marked cytological atypia in LSILs identifies a subset of patients with a high rate of HSIL on follow-up. In such patients, an excisional cone biopsy should be strongly considered."

Report of two Hungarian cases and a review of the literature.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the familial clustering of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in a non-endemic geographical region on the basis of two case reports and a review of the literature. Following an upper respiratory infection, NPC (WHO type III) was detected in a 57-year-old female (Case 1) who presented with nasal symptoms and a year later in her 36-year-old son (Case 2) who presented with enlarged lymph nodes. After a full diagnostic work-up, cT2a cN0 cM0 (stage IIA; Case 1) and cT2a cN2 cM0 (stage III; Case 2) disease were identified, and telecobalt irradiation was administered to both patients. The mother achieved complete remission and has been disease-free during a 14-year follow-up period. After initial complete remission, the son experienced regional (cervical) and base of the skull relapses within 2 years, which were treated unsuccessfully by means of radical neck dissection, a second course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected in pathology sections from both patients. The authors review 20 additional well-documented cases of familial clustering of NPC in non-endemic geographical regions from the English language literature. This clinical entity typically has WHO type III histology; it may occur following an upper respiratory tract infection, and EBV-related serological titers were elevated in all 20 investigated cases. No consequent promoting factors were identified. The present two cases and the review of the literature strongly suggest that familial clustering of NPC in non-endemic geographical areas may be related to EBV infections. The difference in outcome of our two cases may be explained by the fact that the disease in Case 2 was diagnosed 1 year later than that in Case 1 and hence at a more advanced stage."

Sample takers should: (1) receive appropriate training in sample collection, (2) be held responsible for providing the laboratory with appropriate samples, and (3) have their performance monitored. The instruments used for sampling should collect cells from both the ectocervix and endocervix; optimally, TZ sampling, represented by the presence of endocervical or squamous metaplastic cells, should be identifiable in samples other than atrophic specimens. The adequacy of a specimen (as judged microscopically) does not guarantee that it is representative of the cervix. Each cytology report should include a comment on cellular content/adequacy of the specimen. Liquid-based preparations may overcome many of the inherent problems with the conventional cervical smear."

Baseline specimens collected from women referred into ALTS based on an ASCUS Pap result were prospectively tested by hc2 and retrospectively tested by Amplicor (n = 3,277). Following receiver-operator-characteristics curve analysis, Amplicor performance was analyzed at three cutoffs (0.2, 1.0, and 1.5). Paired Amplicor and hc2 results were compared for the detection of 2-year cumulative cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 and more severe disease outcomes (CIN3+) and for the detection of 13 targeted carcinogenic HPV types. Amplicor at the 0.2 cutoff had a higher sensitivity for the detection of CIN3+ (95.8% versus 92.6%, P = 0.01) but a much lower specificity (38.9% versus 50.6%, P < 0.001) than hc2. Amplicor at the 1.5 cutoff had an identical sensitivity for the detection of CIN3+ (92.6%) and a slightly lower specificity (47.5%; P < 0.001). The positive predictive value of hc2 was higher at all Amplicor cutoffs, whereas referral rates were significantly lower (53.2% for hc2 versus 64.1% at the 0.2 cutoff and 56.0% at the 1.5 cutoff, P < 0.001). Amplicor was more analytically specific for detecting targeted carcinogenic HPV types than hc2. Amplicor at the 1.5 cutoff had comparable performance with hc2. Whereas Amplicor missed more disease related to nontargeted types, hc2 was more likely to miss disease related to targeted types."

CD008054,0,17008015,0,The up-to-date evidence on colposcopy practice and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: the Cochrane colposcopy & cervical cytopathology collaborative group (C5 group) approach.,"This overview presents the up-to-date evidence on colposcopy practice and other diagnostic modalities such as HPV DNA test and cytology for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Current evidence supports the use of colposcopy for the detection of intraepithelial lesions as a second line tool. CIN treatment involves either excisional or destructive techniques, usually performed under local anesthesia. Although a debate exists about the most efficient approach, the currently available evidence reveals no differences in efficacy among the available conservative methods of treatment. New evidence supports treatment by destructive rather than excisional techniques, at least for low grade lesions in women wishing future childbearing, as they appear to have no apparent pregnancy-related morbidity. Treatment failures rates might increase in cases of involved excision margins, older age or glandular involvement. There is no worldwide consensus on the optimal follow-up policy, interventions or frequency in surveillance after treatment. HPV DNA test combined with either colposcopy or cytology is a promising combination for the early detection of treatment failures due to residual disease. Existing guidelines should probably be updated incorporating the new information emerged from recently published work."

CD008054,0,10672385,0,A pilot study of the efficacy and tolerability of intralesional recombinant human beta-interferons in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Beta-interferons possess anti-viral, cell proliferation inhibition and immunomodulatory characteristics which may be of use in the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Intralesional administration may avoid systemic side effects. Twenty-six women with cervical punch biopsy proven CIN I and II were treated by interferon injection into the cervical transformation zone according to three dosage regimens--6 million international units (IU) weekly for six weeks, 9 million IU weekly for six weeks and 12 million IU bi-weekly for three weeks. At the last treatment visit, cervical cytology and biopsy were taken to ensure no disease progression and large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) was carried out six months after treatment. Therapy was well-tolerated with 93% of the scheduled 156 treatments given. Side effects which caused cessation of treatment included severe myalgia, headaches and prolonged flu-like symptoms. The 2 patients who failed to attend for LLETZ at six months and another 2 patients who received fewer than five scheduled treatments were excluded from analysis. LLETZ histology was negative in 12 patients (54%), showed inflammatory changes or squamous metaplasia in 4 (18%), was unchanged in 4 patients and had progressed in 2 (10%). Whilst intralesional beta-interferon clearly has activity in CIN, the response rate is less than that seen for excisional or ablative procedures. Nevertheless, it may have a role in the management of CIN where, for medical reasons of patient preference, there is a desire to avoid surgical therapy."

The study population consisted of 152 HNSCC patients treated by hyperfractionated radiotherapy alone or concomitant with chemotherapy between September 1994 and July 2000. Tumors were screened for the presence of the MET-activating point mutation Y1253D. Seventy-eight patients (51%) received radiotherapy alone, 74 patients (49%) underwent radiotherapy concomitant with chemotherapy. Median patient age was 54 years and median follow-up was 5.5 years. Distant metastasis-free survival, local relapse-free survival and overall survival were compared with MET Y1253D status. During follow-up, 29 (19%) patients developed distant metastasis. MET Y1253D was detected in tumors of 21 out of 152 patients (14%). Distant metastasis-free survival (P = 0.008) was associated with MET Y1253D. In a multivariate Cox regression model, adjusted for T-category, only presence of MET Y1253D was associated with decreased distant metastasis-free survival: hazard ratio = 2.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.1, 5.8). The observed association between MET Y1253D-activating point mutation and decreased distant metastasis-free survival in advanced HNSCC suggests that MET may be a potential target for specific treatment interventions."

The distinction between oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal primary SCC has important management consequences. In the current study, we evaluated metastatic SCC for HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 51 (by in situ hybridization[ISH]), p16 and ProExC (surrogate HPV markers), and Epstein Barr Virus reported in nasopharyngeal SCC. Forty patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2008, with adequate cell block material were identified. ISH for high risk HPV and EBV (EBER), and immunohistochemistry for p16 and ProExC were performed. Primary site was designated in 31 cases with 26 head and neck including 11 oropharyngeal and 2 nasopharyngeal, and 5 other sites. High risk HPV was detected in 9 cases (22.5%), p16 in 16 (40%), ProExC in 35 (87.5%), and EBER in 2 (5%). All cases with high risk HPV ISH also showed overexpression of p16. The sensitivity for HPV infection by both surrogate markers was 100%; specificity for p16 and ProExC was 78.7 and 16.1%, respectively. Seven (63.6%) oropharyngeal SCC were positive for HPV ISH and negative for EBV; one nasopharyngeal SCC (50%) was EBER positive and HPV negative. HPV and EBER detection can serve as indicators for oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal primary SCC, respectively, however our data show that only a subset (63.6%) of oropharyngeal SCC are high risk HPV-related. Additionally, despite their high sensitivity for HPV infection, surrogate markers, especially ProExC, lack specificity."

Occasionally the primary tumor site remains unknown even after thorough investigation. Management of such cases is problematic and may result in over-treatment and consequent increased morbidity. High risk HPV has been advocated recently as an important etiologic factor for a subset of head and neck SCC. These are believed to have a special predilection for the oropharyngeal tonsils and are characterized by nonkeratinizing basaloid morphology, and a strong reactivity to p16 immunostain. Identifying HPV-related SCC in the lymph nodes may thus provide a means for localizing the primary tumor site."
CD008054,0,20922700,0,[Skin cancer in renal transplant recipients].,"Kidney transplant is the best treatment option for renal failure. Over the years the 1-year patient survival has gradually increased, along with a reduction in acute rejection. The main causes of death in the late post-transplant period are cardiovascular disease, infections and malignancies. It is known that the incidence of cancer increases with the duration of post-transplant follow-up. Twenty years after transplantation, approximately 70% of patients on continuous immunosuppressive therapy present one or more tumor types. Some of the tumors that occur with a significantly higher frequency in transplant recipients compared with the general population are often associated with the reactivation of oncogenic viruses. Examples are herpes virus 8 (HHV8), implicated in Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), human papillomavirus (HPV), involved in squamous cell cancer of the skin, vulva, vagina and cervix, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), responsible for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). The type of drug used for the induction and maintenance of immunosuppression and the duration of treatment influence both the incidence and the type of cancer. For this reason, post-transplant malignancies often show a more aggressive behavior than tumors in the normal population. It is estimated that sarcomas occur 40 to 250 times more frequently in transplant recipients and are the leading cause of death from skin cancer after transplantation. The classic form of KS occurs in males and homosexuals. In the population of the Mediterranean area, KS is often associated with HHV8 infection that is reactivated by immunosuppression. The reduction or suspension of immunosuppressive therapy is the first step in the treatment of post-transplant KS. The second approach is chemotherapy. Since m-TOR, the target of sirolimus, is altered in many tumors, sirolimus may be an effective tool. Sirolimus inhibits not only cell proliferation but also tumor neovascularization by reducing VEGF production and inhibiting VEGF receptor signaling in endothelial cells. In conclusion, new strategies must be developed to reduce cancer mortality in transplant recipients while ensuring adequate immunosuppression to preserve the transplanted organ. One such strategy is the adoption of immunosuppressive regimens tailored to individual patients' medical history."

The study group consisted of 42 women with invasive cervical SCC and 50 control subjects. All of the patients were primarily treated with surgical intervention. Blood samples (5 mL) were obtained from the patients before surgery or during follow-up to 2 years after surgery. DNA was extracted from the leukocytes by a high pure PCR template preparation kit (catalog No. 1 796 828; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). NAT2*5A, NAT2*6A, and NAT2*7A/B polymorphisms of NAT2 were detected by using a LightCycler-NAT2 mutation detection kit in real-time PCR (catalog No. 3113914, LightCycler instrument; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). We found that the risk of cervical SCC was 9.045-fold higher in individuals with NAT2*5A mutant allele (95% confidence interval, 1.448-56.524; P = 0.018). The frequency of the NAT2*5A slow genotypes in the patients with cervical cancer (23.8%) was significantly higher compared with that in the control group (6%). Individuals with the NAT2*5A slow genotype had a significantly higher risk of cervical cancer compared with individuals with the NAT2*5A fast genotype (odds ratio, 7.469; 95% confidence interval, 1.673-33.350; P = 0.008). However, there was no significant association between the NAT2*6A and NAT2*7A/B fast or slow acetylator status and the development of cervical cancer. In conclusion, NAT2*5A slow acetylator genotype was found to be significantly higher in patients with cervical cancer. These results suggest that NAT2*5A gene polymorphisms in patients may be associated with genetic susceptibility to cervical cancer."

We have performed a systematic review of all randomized controlled trials in which vaccines against HPV were compared with placebo regarding efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. Six studies met the inclusion criteria, which included 47,236 women. The first objective in this systematic review was to assess vaccine efficacy in the prevention of cytologically and/or histologically proven lesions. And the secondary objective was the evaluation of safety and vaccine immunogenicity. Bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines significantly reduced the rate of lesions in the cervix, vulva, vagina, and anogenital region, with efficacy of 93% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87-96) and 62% (95% CI, 27-70), respectively, when compared with the control groups according to intention to treat. Regarding safety, we found more symptoms in the bivalent vaccine group (35%; 95% CI, 5-73) when compared with the control groups. In regard to vaccine immunogenicity, there was seroconversion in the group that received the vaccine when compared with the placebo group in the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines.

CD008054,0,16080313,0,Human immunodeficiency virus infection: personal experience in changes in head and neck manifestations due to recent antiretroviral therapies.,"Both the incidence and prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection are increasing in the world. Diseases of ENT districts are more frequent in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients and involve all the otolaryngological sites. The otorhinolaryngological manifestations in association with HIV infection are mainly atypical, so common in the clinical practice, really aspecific and very frequent in ENT daily routine (such as sinusitis, otitis, etc.) and, therefore, immunodeficiency may not be suspected. In other cases, ENT evidence is more peculiar or unusual, such as opportunistic infections, rare neoplasm and tumours with an unusual course, giving a very high suspect of a human immunodeficiency virus-related infection. The most frequent malignant neoplasm is Kaposi's Sarcoma which is extremely rare in non-human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects; the second most frequent is non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with 50% in extranodal sites (oral and maxillary sinus). Following a review of the literature, modifications caused by current antiretroviral treatment on head and neck manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus infection have been evaluated. Highly active antiretroviral therapy is a new therapeutic strategy, based on poly-chemo-therapeutic schemes, providing simultaneously two or more anti-retroviral drugs. We have used highly active antiretroviral therapy in human immunodeficiency virus infection since 1997, substituting previous mono-chemotherapy based on Zidovudine or Didanosine alone. Highly active antiretroviral therapy is extremely efficient in reducing the viral load of human immunodeficiency virus and increasing CD4+ T-lymphocyte count. These biological effects are associated with an improvement in immune functions. To evaluate the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy on otorhinolaryngological manifestations in human immunodeficiency virus infection, we performed a retrospective study on 470 adults, observed over 14 years (1989-2002) and constantly receiving the same treatment, with follow-up from 7 to 80 months. A total of 250 subjects underwent mono-antiretroviral chemotherapy (1989-1996), while 220 underwent highly active antiretroviral therapy (1997-2002). The results of the retrospective study showed that highly active antiretroviral therapy has greatly improved the control of the immune-deficiency (increasing the range of CD4+), reducing the number of otorhinolaryngological manifestations (also tumours). On the other hand, 2 patients presented sudden unilateral hearing loss following treatment: toxicity due to association of new drugs cannot be excluded."

The women visited the Outpatient Department of Gynecology, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland at six-month intervals. At each visit, a thorough gynecologic examination, PAP-smear, and colposcopy with or without punch biopsy were performed. Epidemiologic data were collected by questionnaire, and complete follow-up data were available for 480 of the 528 women. Of these 480 cases of HPV infection, 58.3% regressed spontaneously, and clinical progression was detected in 14.8%. To establish the prognostic factors associated with the clinical course of cervical HPV infections, the Cox proportional hazards regression model was applied. In the analysis, five variables were included: age, PAP-smear class, grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), HPV type, and colposcopic appearance at the first visit. In general, patient age at the time of diagnosis was inversely related to the probability of spontaneous regression (P less than 0.01). CIN II, CIN III and HPV type 16 were the most significant independent prognostic factors for progression of cervical HPV infections (P less than 0.001, P less than 0.0001, and P less than 0.001, respectively). We conclude that whenever HPV 16 DNA is found in the cervical biopsy with any grade of CIN, the lesion should be treated. Similarly, the presence of CIN II and CIN III indicates treatment whether HPV DNA are detected or not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008054,0,19091066,0,New paradigms in cervical cancer prevention: opportunities and risks.,"Testing for the DNA of high-risk types of papilloma virus (HPV) is more sensitive than cytology in detecting pre-cancerous lesions. One of the main advantages will be the possibility of applying prolonged screening intervals. However adequate screening protocols (age of start and stop, screening intervals, management of HPV positive women) need to be applied in order to avoid over-referral to colposcopy and over-treatment and to maintain sustainable costs. Further follow-up of running trials and research on molecular markers will better define these parameters. The new situation will require organised screening programmes with rigorous protocols and monitoring. This will be even more needed when women vaccinated for HPV 16 and 18 will be screened. Research on how to best screen vaccinated women is a priority. This paper proposes an overview of the plausible impact of new technologies in cervical cancer screening in the near future and in the vaccinated cohorts."

CD008054,0,15963882,0,Diagnosis and management of oncogenic cervical human papillomavirus infection.,"Cervical HPV infection should be managed less as a typical STI and more as a strong risk factor predisposing to cervical cancer development. HPV infection is undeniably transmitted predominately through sexual contact.However, the fact that more than 80% of women followed over time will acquire at least one HR-HPV infection reflects the ubiquitous nature of the infection and the ease of transmission. Although the behavioral profiles typically associated with an increased risk for STI (including lifetime partner number, age at first intercourse, and so forth) will certainly lead to an increased risk for HPV detection, there is a high absolute prevalence of HPV even among women who have few lifetime sex partners. It could be argued that to counsel patients for an HPV infection as an STI would be counterproductive, as short of absolute abstinence, the prevention of infection is difficult and treatment options, short of excisional procedures for neoplasia, are limited. The real promise held in this area is the availability of an apparently highly effective prophylactic HPV vaccine, targeting at least HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11[33,34]. This vaccine cocktail, if it achieved 100% coverage, could theoretically prevent 50% to 70% of invasive cervical cancers and most genital warts. Vaccination will be required among women before initiation of sexual contact, presumably among girls 10 to 13 years of age. Many programmatic issues remain regarding the implementation of HPV vaccine programs, including the marketing of the vaccine as STI or cancer prevention,as reviewed in detail by Gravitt and Shah [72]. Even in the era of potentially effective vaccines, screening for cervical cancer is likely to remain a priority in cervical cancer prevention programs for at least several decades. Vaccine trials have proven high short-term efficacy; however, these effects were clearly type-specific and antibody titers gradually decrease postvaccination. It is unclear whether the protection will remain over an individual's lifetime without vaccine booster, and oncogenic HPV infections not targeted by vaccination will continue to contribute to risk for development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer. Therefore, although the public health success of HPV vaccination is undoubtedly promising, the role of cervical cancer screening as a secondary prevention effort should not be trivialized. In fact, the nature of screening programs should continue to be reevaluated in the context of effective but limited spectrum vaccines."

We assessed the reliability of mailed vaginal samples by evaluating the quantity and quality of genomic DNA in the samples. Mailed swabs (n = 201) were compared with freshly collected samples (n = 200) for DNA concentration (45.1 versus 50.9 ng/microl, respectively) and purity (mean optical density [OD] 260/280 ratio 1.88 versus 1.78, respectively). A small, non-significant, decrease in DNA yield with longer transport time was noted. The DNA yield of mailed samples was significantly lower compared to fresh samples (P < 0.002), but this lower yield had little effect on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. In conclusion, the large majority of mailed self-sampled vaginal swabs resulted in DNA of adequate purity and concentration for further research."
CD008054,0,8278585,0,"Oxygen in human tumors: correlations between methods of measurement and response to therapy. Summary of a workshop held November 19-20, 1992, at the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.","Knowledge about the oxygenation of human tumors and its importance in the response to radiotherapy is crucial to the effort to develop improved treatment methods for radiotherapy. The measurement of oxygenation of human tumors and correlations with response to radiotherapy were the subjects of a recent workshop sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. The following methods for measuring oxygen or hypoxia, or a parameter related to either, were presented: polarographic oxygen electrodes, the comet and alkaline elution assays for radiation-induced DNA damage, nitroimidazole binding assays, hemoglobin saturation assays, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, phosphorescence imaging, and an assay for tumor interstitial pressure. The electron spin resonance, alkaline elution, and phosphorescence imaging methods have not been used in human tumors. The comet assay, nitroimidazole binding assays, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, cryospectroscopy, and near-infrared spectroscopy have been employed in human tumors, but correlations to treatment response have not been made. Polarographic measurements have indicated that the presence of hypoxia correlates with a poor response to radiotherapy in cervical cancers, but additional data are needed on early-stage disease, and with long-term follow-up on local control and survival. If these confirm the correlation between hypoxia and poor response to radiotherapy, additional tumor sites should be studied. Future clinical trials of treatments that sensitize, exploit, or kill hypoxic cells should identify and include the individual patients with hypoxic tumors. Fundamental unanswered questions regarding the assessment of tumor oxygenation concern the need for invasive procedures, the spatial resolution needed for prediction of response to radiotherapy, the importance of reoxygenation, differences between tumors in rates and degrees of reoxygenation, whether measurements made during a course of therapy are of value, and correlations among methods and with other predictive assays such as intrinsic radiosensitivity and potential doubling time."
CD008054,0,15835076,0,Age-specific incidence and clearance of high-risk human papillomavirus infections in women in the former Soviet Union.,"Recently, conflicting results on human papillomavirus (HPV) clearance have been reported and the data on the accumulation of incident HPV infections are still fragmentary. Thus, we completed an analysis of the age-specific incidence and clearance rates of high-risk (HR) HPV infections in 448 women participating in a multi-centre screening study in three New Independent States countries. At baseline, 239 of the 448 women were negative for HR HPV DNA, whereas 209 were HR HPV-positive and cleared HR HPV during the prospective follow-up. The cumulative incidence and clearance of HR HPV were modelled using life-table techniques. The monthly incidence rates of HR HPV were significantly age dependent (p = 0.0001), whereas monthly clearance rates remained constant across the nine age groups (p = 0.920). The incidence rates (3.04% and 2.65%) exceeded the clearance rates in the two youngest age groups only, 15-20- and 21-25-year-old women, and remained lower (0-0.84%) in all other age groups. The cumulative rate of incident HR HPV infections (1.0%) was significantly lower than the overall clearance rate (1.9%) (p = 0.001). In life-table analysis, incident HR HPV infections between the nine age groups were significantly different (p = 0.0001), while cumulative HR HPV clearance was identical in all groups (p = 0.822). The accumulation of incident HR HPV infections is significantly age-related, whereas virus clearance remains constant between 15 and 60 years of age. These distinct age-specific incidence and clearance rates explain the differences in age-specific prevalence of HR HPV infections in the study population."

CD008054,0,15754993,0,Immunohistochemistry in assessment of molecular pathogenesis of cervical carcinogenesis.,"Concerning the prediction of HPV-associated cervical disease, several importance issues are related both to the management of women with diagnosed CIN and those with cervical cancer. Oncogenic HPVs are capable of contributing to the development of malignant phenotype by several different mechanisms, most of which seem to be closely interrelated. Because of the fact that these molecular interactions are mediated by proteins, the logical strategy to dissect the complex molecular pathways is to study the functions of these proteins, utilising the capabilities of immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC offers practically unlimited possibilities to study any target molecules, against which a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody can be raised. This review describes the IHC-based strategies used by this author to assess the molecular pathogenesis of cervical cancer and its precursors in a number of large-scale prospective cohort studies conducted during the past 25 years. In the ongoing HPV-PathogenISS study, 13 different markers are being tested to evaluate their predictive value in distinct viral events, e.g. persistence or clearance of high-risk HPV in women treated for CIN. Apart from getting new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HPV-associated cervical carcinogenesis, we anticipate the disclosure of individual markers, a set of markers, or an expression profile of any such marker sets that would be of clinical value as predictors of disease outcome in cervical carcinogenesis."

Following implementation of reflex testing, our laboratory processed 8,022 specimens during a 20-month period; sufficient material was available for testing in 7,334 specimens. High-risk HPV was detected in 34.10% of these specimens. Detection rates varied with age, with positive rates as high as 58.46% in women 20 years old or younger, decreasing to 14.58% in women older than 35 years. The detection rate, categorized in 5-year age increments, showed a significant decrease until after 35 years, when the rate remained fairly constant (P < .0001). The detection rate decreased over the time of the study. These results demonstrate that high-risk HPV detection might vary according to the age mix of the population tested and the interval after implementation of testing."

In contrast, levels in the developed countries of the region are low, as is also the case for the Muslim countries of Western Asia, and mainland China. Incidence generally mirrora associated mortality, although with some exceptions reflecting facilities and infrastructure for early detection. Over the last 25 years there has been a marked decrease in incidence rates across most of the Asian Pacific, although less pronounced in India than elsewhere, and there are exceptions where the incidence is on the increase. The predominant risk factor is well established to be persistent infection with a high risk 'oncogenic' type of human papilloma virus (HPV), along with multiple partners, other sexually transmitted diseases and smoking. Consumption of vegetables, in contrast, appears to be protective. Hormonal factors may also play some role. Modifying factors may either impact on neoplasia by directly influencing the processes underlying carcinogenesis, or indirectly by affecting persistence of viral infections. For primary prevention, avoidance of repeated infections and smoking, as well as a high antioxidant intake may be beneficial. Vaccines against HPV also have promise for the future, but a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying spontaneous clearance of both infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) of different grades is also essential for optimal intervention. For screening, the choice of whether the PAP smear, HPV testing or some form of visual inspection are utilized depends on the resources which are available, all approaches having their own advantages and disadvantages, but with similar sensitivity and specificity. One complication is the increase in adenocarcinoma of the cervix which has been reported in some countries, for which risk factors and most effective screening may differ from the SCC case. A focus on high risk groups like sex workers might be warranted where financial and technical support are limited. If cervical intraepithelial neoplasias are detected then cryotherapy or the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) are effective for their removal. Control of cancer of the cervix, however, demands that a comprehensive approach to screening and management is adopted, necessitating major training of personnel and provision of appropriate resources."

CD008054,0,16081575,0,Cancer therapy-related oral mucositis.,"Oral mucositis is a common side effect of cancer therapies, particularly radiation therapy for head and neck cancer and various forms of chemotherapy. It commonly results in severe oral pain that can compromise the duration and success of cancer management. Hospitalizations are common because patients lose the ability to take anything by mouth due to severe pain and must have alimentation supported during this period. Pain management usually requires potent narcotic analgesia. Cancer therapy-related oral mucositis is commonly described as the most significant and debilitating acute complication associated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Until recently, cancer therapy-induced oral mucositis was thought to be a process involving the epithelium only. Evidence is building that the process of oral mucositis involves far more than just the epithelium, but includes multiple cellular processes of the submucosa as well. Many strategies have been evaluated to prevent oral mucositis, but the data is confusing since it is often conflicting. Therapy with the growth factor, KGF1, appears promising, as it is the only medication currently approved by the FDA.

A two-step method was developed for detection and genotyping of high-risk HPV. DNA was firstly amplified by asymmetrical PCR in the presence of Cy3-labelled primers and dUTP. Labelled DNA was then genotyped using DNA microarray hybridization. The current study evaluated the technical efficacy of laboratory-designed HPV DNA microarrays for high-risk HPV genotyping on 57 malignant and non-malignant cervical smears. The approach was evaluated for a broad range of cytological samples: high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and atypical squamous cells of high-grade (ASC-H). High-risk HPV was also detected in six atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) samples; among them only one cervical specimen was found uninfected, associated with no histological lesion. The HPV oligonucleotide DNA microarray genotyping detected 36 infections with a single high-risk HPV type and 5 multiple infections with several high-risk types. Taken together, these results demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of the HPV DNA microarray approach. This approach could improve clinical management of patients with cervical cytological abnormalities."
CD008054,0,12010863,0,Regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and loss of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is associated with cell-mediated immune responses to an HPV type 16 E7 peptide.,"Most human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia(CIN) lesions in normal women regress spontaneously, but a small number persist and may progress to invasive cancer. To evaluate the role of immunity to HPV and the outcome of CIN and associated HPV infection, we examined cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses to HPV 16 E6 and E7 peptides. One hundred thirty-six women with biopsy-confirmed CIN I or CIN II were followed for 1 year at 3 month intervals. Study subjects were 58% Hispanic, 36% African American, and 6% of other ethnicity, and were attending a municipal hospital colposcopy clinic. At each visit, cervical cytology and cervicovaginal lavage for HPV detection and typing was done, and blood was obtained for immunological studies. Lymphoproliferative CMI responses to HPV 16 E6 and E7 peptides were tested. An end point biopsy was done after the 1-year follow-up. The association between CMI responses to specific peptides and the outcome of disease was evaluated. CMI responses to E7 peptide (37-54) correlated significantly with regression of disease and with resolution of viral infection within 12 months. The protective effects of CMI to this peptide were not HPV type-specific. CMI responses to several other peptides also showed an association with regression, although not significant at present sample size. E7 peptide 37-54 contains one or more human T-cell epitopes. Identification and mapping of ""protective"" epitopes in the HPV E6 and E7 proteins could lead to the development of immunological assays to determine the risk of CIN and the development of immunotherapeutic protocols for the management of premalignant and malignant HPV-associated neoplasia and, ultimately, for the prevention of cancer."

CD008054,0,10328594,0,Human papillomavirus in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: are some head and neck cancers a sexually transmitted disease?,"There is abundant epidemiologic and virologic evidence that high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are tumorigenic in human epithelia, particularly in the cervix, where HPV infection is necessary for cancer development. HPV DNA has been detected in a proportion of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) in numerous case series. The mere presence of the virus in tumor specimens, by itself, does not imply a causal relationship. However, recent studies support an etiologic role for HPVs in a subset of HNSCC, particularly poorly differentiated tumors arising from Waldeyer's tonsillar ring. Epidemiologic studies have shown that exposure to HPV increases the risk of HNSCC, and HPV infection may interact with alcohol and tobacco exposure in tumor promotion. Molecular studies indicate that transcriptionally active virus is confined to tumor cells. It will be important to clarify further the role that HPV has in HNSCC development, because HPV-based therapeutic vaccines which are currently being developed for cervical cancer may also be of benefit in the management of HNSCC."
CD008054,0,8332306,0,Cervicography as an adjunct to cytologic screening.,"Cervicography is not a surrogate for colposcopy. Its easy availability and economy maximize the predictive potential of the existing screening test, the Pap smear. It can also be used as a triage tool for women ""at risk"" for cervical HPV infections, such as women with a history of vulvar condylomata. It is not colpophotography, as the magnification and focus are stable, and the operator cannot manipulate the position of the cervix and change focus and light settings. Cervicography cannot replace Pap smears in detection programs, but can augment the predictive value of screening when used in tandem. Stafl cautions gynecologic practitioners to use the two in partnership and that the duo can push cervical cancer detection rates closer to 100%. What Cervicography does provide is a screening tool with great potential and a way to attack the troubling death rates from cervical cancer still facing us in the 21st century."

CD008054,0,17600933,0,Cervical cancer screening programme in Finland with an example on implementing alternative screening methods.,"In Finland (population 5 million) the organised Pap screening programme for preventing cervical cancer has been in action already for 45 years. Women aged 30 to 64 are targeted (N 1.25 million) and the screening interval is five years. The programme invites women seven times in a lifetime; the attendance rate per one screening invitational round is 73%. The programme has affected markedly the cervical cancer rates in our country. During the decennia of its action there has been about 80% decrease in the age-adjusted cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates. The current age-standardised incidence rate is 4 and mortality rate 1 per 100,000 woman-years. In the current article we describe the organisational aspects of the programme; and pay attention to renovation of the programme taken place during the last decade when novel technological alternatives have been started to be used as the screening tests. By expanding the coverage and compliance of screening we still expect to increase the impact of the programme. Same time, efforts are needed to avoid overuse of services due to spontaneous screening, in order to decrease potential adverse effects and improve overall cost-effectiveness. A large-scale public health policy trial on Human papillomavirus (HPV) screening is on-going. Cross-sectional information available thus far suggests promising results. Follow-up of cancer rates after screening episodes are still required to evaluate optimal screening policies (e.g., screening intervals by age groups, and starting and stopping ages). We propose speeding up the use of modern technological alternatives in organised screening programmes."
CD008054,0,12107839,0,A prospective study of the relationship between prediagnostic human papillomavirus seropositivity and HPV DNA in subsequent cervical carcinomas.,"Several prospective studies with invasive carcinoma as endpoint have supported Human Papillomavirus as a cause of cervical carcinoma. However, the largest study used seroepidemiology and did not analyse presence of Human Papillomavirus DNA in the subsequent tumour. Linkage of serum bank registries and cancer registries had identified 196 women with a registered cervical carcinoma after donation of a serum sample. For the present study, biopsies for 127 cases could be located, verified to contain invasive carcinoma and be amplified by PCR. Three control women who had remained alive and without cervical carcinoma during an equal length of follow-up had been matched to each of the case women and tested for HPV antibodies. Presence of Human Papillomavirus DNA in the tumours was analysed by general primer and type specific PCR. HPV16-seropositive women had a relative risk of 4.4 (95% CI: 2.2-8.8) to develop cervical carcinoma carrying HPV16 DNA. By contrast, there was no excess risk for Human Papillomavirus 16-seropositive women to develop cervical carcinoma devoid of HPV16 DNA. Prediagnostic HPV16 seropositivity was strongly correlated with later HPV16 DNA positivity of the tumour (P<0.001) and prediagnostic HPV18 seropositivity correlated with HPV18 DNA in the tumour (P<0.03). The link between prediagnostic seropositivity and type of viral DNA in the cancer implies that the carcinogenic effect of infection with these viruses is dependent on persistent presence of type-specific viral DNA."

The overall rate of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in the group studied was 29.3% (22/75). Eight out of 10 high-grade CIN lesions contained 'high-risk' HPV-DNA 16/18 and/or 31/35/51 as demonstrated by 'in situ' hybridization with biotinylated probes. Vulvar and/or perianal condylomata were histologically diagnosed in 14 patients (18.7%); nine of these biopsies contained detectable HPV-DNA which was always related to HPV 6/11. The rate of high-grade CIN in symptomatic HIV-infected patients was 28% (7/25) as compared to 6% (3/50) of the other cases (P = 0.022). CD4 lymphocyte counts, white blood cell counts, CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio and percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes were lower in patients with high-grade CIN in comparison to the patients with negative colposcopical and/or cytological examination. After adequate standard treatment (cryotherapy, electrocauterization, cold-knife conization) only one case of CIN 2 recurred during the 2 years of follow-up period. The prevalence of lower genital neoplasia and HPV-related lesions among HIV-infected women is high and seems to correlate with the severity of HIV disease."

The objective of this study was to describe the cytologic outcomes of women who had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) diagnosis after a Pap smear and to observe any changes during follow-up colposcopy. A total of 852 abnormal Pap smear were identified through a computer search for a 6-month period. Histology data were available for 317 cases. Benign findings were observed in 45.4% of cervical biopsies. A clinically significant diagnosis was reported in the remaining tissue sample. The diagnosis report was either single or combined and recorded as follows: human papilloma virus 46.3%, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 23.6%; CIN 2, 5.6%; and CIN 3, 1.5%. There was one case of invasive cervical cancer. Overall, the incidence rate of ASCUS was 5%. However, we found that a significant proportion of this population had CIN 1 through CIN 3. Furthermore, this population has traditionally been noncompliant and routinely failed to attend follow-up appointments. Based on these results, the clinician should not ignore an initial abnormal Pap smear. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to perform colposcopy in Mexican American patients with a first time diagnosis of ASCUS on routine Pap smear."
CD008054,0,18674952,0,Current concepts in management of oral cancer--surgery.,"Oral cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with a high prevalence in South Asia. Tobacco and alcohol consumption remain the most dominant etiologic factors, however HPV has been recently implicated in oral cancer. Surgery is the most well established mode of initial definitive treatment for a majority of oral cancers. The factors that affect choice of treatment are related to the tumor and the patient. Primary site, location, size, proximity to bone, and depth of infiltration are factors which influence a particular surgical approach. Tumors that approach or involve the mandible require specific understanding of the mechanism of bone involvement. This facilitates the employment of mandible sparing approaches such as marginal mandibulectomy and mandibulotomy. Reconstruction of major surgical defects in the oral cavity requires use of a free flap. The radial forearm free flap provides excellent soft tissue and lining for soft tissue defects in the oral cavity. The fibula free flap remains the choice for mandibular reconstruction. Over the course of the past thirty years there has been improvement in the overall survival of patients with oral carcinoma largely due to the improved understanding of the biology of local progression, early identification and treatment of metastatic lymph nodes in the neck, and employment of adjuvant post-operative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. The role of surgery in primary squamous cell carcinomas in other sites in the head and neck has evolved with integration of multidisciplinary treatment approaches employing chemotherapy and radiotherapy either sequentially or concurrently. Thus, larynx preservation with concurrent chemoradiotherapy has become the standard of care for locally advanced carcinomas of the larynx or pharynx requiring total laryngectomy. On the other hand, for early staged tumors of the larynx and pharynx, transoral laser microsurgery has become an effective means of local control of these lesions. Advances in skull base surgery have significantly improved the survivorship of patients with malignant tumors of the paranasal sinuses approaching or involving the skull base. Surgery thus remains the mainstay of management of a majority of neoplasms arising in the head and neck area. Similarly, the role of the surgeon is essential throughout the life history of a patient with a malignant neoplasm in the head and neck area, from initial diagnosis through definitive treatment, post-treatment surveillance, management of complications, rehabilitation of the sequelae of treatment, and finally for palliation of symptoms."

An aggressive neoplasm associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome and lymphangiomatosis.,"We report the clinical and pathological features of nine distinctive, but relatively unknown, vascular tumors of infancy and childhood presenting as soft tissue masses often associated with locally aggressive disease, lymphangiomatosis and Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. The patients, four males and five females, were all in their first decade of life except for two (median, 2 years; range, 5 months to 19 years). These tumors involved deep soft tissues of the upper extremity (four cases), retroperitoneum (two cases), chest wall, scalp, and neck (one case each). Four patients also had Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, and three patients had lymphangiomatosis. Lymphangiomatosis consisted of diffusely infiltrating lymphangioma of soft tissue (three cases) and in two by the additional presence of bone lesions. In one of these three cases, lymphangiomatosis antedated the diagnosis of the vascular tumor, and in the remainder they were concurrently diagnosed. Tumors were characterized by infiltrating, interconnecting sheets or irregular nodules of slender endothelial cells lining crescentic or slit-like vessels and, less commonly, rounded capillary-type vessels. Within some tumors, nests of epithelioid endothelial cells with prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm containing finely granular hemosiderin, hyaline droplets, and cytoplasmic vacuoles were identified. Smaller amounts of hemosiderin were observed within the spindled endothelial cells and microthrombi could be seen occasionally within the tiny lumina. Nuclear atypia was minimal within these tumors and mitotic figures were infrequent, averaging 2 to 3/10 high-power fields (HPF) (range 0-7/10 HPF). Larger, well-formed feeding vessels were present at the periphery of the tumor. The endothelium of these vessels expressed factor VIII-AG, CD34, and bound Ulex europaeus, and contained an occasional perithelial cell expressing muscle-specific actin. In contrast, the spindled tumor cells expressed only CD34. Human papilloma virus (HPV)-16-like DNA transcripts, which have been identified in cases of Kaposi's sarcoma, were not detected by polymerase chain reaction in two cases. Follow-up information revealed that four patients were alive without disease after wide excision, multiple excision(s), or amputation (one case); three were alive with disease; and two died, one from lymphangiomatosis with respiratory compromise and the other from hemorrhage complicating Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. It appears that treatment should consist of wide local excision and supportive therapy for associated symptoms."

In HIV-infected women, however, there is some evidence that HAART may be associated with regression of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cervical disease. So far, epidemiologic data provided by cancer registries have shown no reduction in the incidence of cervical and anal cancer in patients with HIV infection since the initiation of HAART in 1996. Recent data suggest that HPV infection occurs in the anal canal of immunocompromised patients, as an opportunistic infection, in the absence of receptive anal intercourse.

Specimens were tested for HPV DNA using hybrid capture 2 (HC2) and PCR-reverse line blotting. 65 LSILs with HPV DNA types 16, 18, 52, or 58 were examined for physical status, E2/E6 ratio and viral load at two time points, along with patient age. Women with LSILs whose viral loads increased between baseline and 6 month follow-up had a 45% risk of developing HSIL (OR=7.6, 95% CI=1.9-29.4, P<0.01), as evaluated by real-time PCR and a 44% risk (OR=6.1, 95% CI=1.6-22.7, P<0.01), as evaluated by HC2. The two viral load measures correlated well (Person's coefficient, r=0.687, P<0.001). Such evaluations of viral load changes (increased or not increased) through repeat HPV DNA testing could predict progression of disease in LSIL cases of HPV types 16, 18, 52, and 58, which correlates to clinical implications."

The kappa value between all CC laboratories and the HPV QC laboratory was 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.89), with kappa values for individual CCs and the HPV QC laboratory ranging from 0.79 to 0.89. Agreement between test results was lowest among results for women with negative cytologic findings (0.73); among those with equivocal or abnormal cytologic findings, kappa values were 0.80 or more. These data show that HC2 is a reliable test for detecting clinically relevant oncogenic HPV DNA."

Diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of cytological changes in the cervix, vagina and vulva].","Approximately 150 cervical cancer cases are diagnosed in Finland annually. Both incidence and mortality have decreased by 80% since organised screening began. Recently, screening based on primary HPV-testing with Pap-smear triage has been shown to be more sensitive and more specific among women over 35 years old in randomised studies and thus may be implemented in routine. Abnormal findings in Pap smears indicate management. Confirmed CIN1 lesions are followed up and CIN2 and worse lesions treated. Follow-up after treatment should be reliably arranged, because elevated risk of cancer remains over 20 years after treatment. Quality control is of utmost importance."
CD008054,0,8392678,0,Colposcopic differentiation of abnormalities arising in the transformation zone.,"When metaplastic cervical epithelium is exposed to the factors responsible for neoplasia, the transformation zone becomes atypical. These changes, visible as acetowhite epithelium, altered vascular patterns, and irregular surface contour, are easily recognized through the colposcope in most patients. It is possible to grade the changes to determine the severity of the abnormality and so, in consultation with the patient, decide on the best management course. However, there will always be lesions where colposcopy is indeterminate, and biopsy of such lesions is mandatory. Combined colposcopy and histology are still the mainstays of clinical management. As yet, more refined investigations, such as HPV-subtype determination, have not demonstrated any advantage for these patients."

CD008054,0,16900471,0,Dutch solutions for liquid-based cytology: analysis of unsatisfactory slides and HPV testing of equivocal cytology.,"The liquid-based techniques to obtain microscopy slides for cervical screening have replaced conventional smears almost completely in the USA, but not in all European countries. The decision making process to use liquid-based cytology (LBC) for nationwide screening programs depends on the health system. In a pilot study of over 7,000 screenees, we analyzed the unsatisfactory LBC slides and tested the equivocal cytologies for HPV by using the LiPA test. For comparison over 48,000 conventional screening data were used. Compared to conventional smears, the LBC slides were highly cellular, the state of fixation was much better, and obscuring blood did not exist. The unsatisfactory rate showed an increase from 262/100,000 (conventional smears) to 357/100,000 (LBC slides) due to too thick, undiagnosable epithelial fragments on the LBC slides. HPV testing of the equivocal cytology leads to a better patient management and less unnecessary referrals."
CD008054,0,8392673,0,Biology and colposcopic features of human papillomavirus-associated cervical disease.,"Target biopsy and transformation zone ablation on excision is the mainstay of management for cervical lesions that can be adequately visualized. For the physician who does not progress beyond whimsical estimates of lesion prominence (which cannot differentiate minor- from major-grade lesions), the colposcope will never be more than a simple aid to the collection of directed biopsy specimens. Unfortunately, in situations in which the clinician's only option is passive response to the histopathology report, optimal management of the patient's disease will not occur. Indeed, the best prospect for diagnosing or prognosticating confusing disease patterns can sometimes be lost by blind precipitous intervention. Because the most prominent areas of colposcopic change do not necessarily coincide with the areas of greatest histologic abnormality, less experienced colposcopists may not be able to select the most abnormal sites for target biopsy. Peripheral areas of prominent aceto-whitening tend to be overinterpreted, and the subtle acetowhitening of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia near the canal tends to be easily overlooked. This problem is best solved by using colposcopic criteria that are based on critical analysis, rather than ""pattern recognition."" It is easy to derive the four proven colposcopic criteria, and they can be quickly compiled into an index that helps the clinician recognize lesion severity while he or she is performing the colposcopy. Of course, using the colposcopic index to infer approximate histologic findings does not eliminate the importance of biopsy. Skilled physicians will conscientiously follow the triage rules, including the need to collect carefully sited target biopsy specimens."

CD008054,0,17764095,1,HPV triage testing or repeat Pap smear for the management of atypical squamous cells (ASCUS) on Pap smear: is there evidence of process utility?,"A two-stage standard gamble was used to evaluate women's preferences for alternative managements of atypical squamous cells of undermined significance (ASCUS) on Pap smear (repeat Pap smear compared with immediate HPV test), and to test for the evidence of process utility. Women's utilities for the health state scenarios were clustered towards the upper end of the 0-1 scale with considerable variability in women's preferences. There was evidence of process utility, with immediate human papillomavirus (HPV) testing strategies having lower valuations than repeat Pap smear, where the clinical outcome was the same. Mean (95% CI) utilities for HPV testing (negative test) followed by resolution were 0.9967 (0.9957-0.9978) compared with repeat Pap smear followed by resolution: 0.9972 (0.9964-0.9980). Mean (95% CI) utilities for immediate HPV testing (positive test), followed by colposcopy, biopsy and treatment were 0.9354 (0.8544-1.0) compared with repeat Pap smear followed by colposcopy, biopsy and treatment: 0.9656 (0.9081-1.0). Our results add to the existing evidence that the impact of healthcare interventions on well-being is not limited to the effect of the intervention on the health outcomes expected from the intervention; process of care can have quality of life implications for the individual. A modelled application of trial-based data will allow characterisation of the true population costs, benefits, risks and harms of alternative triage strategies and subsequent policy implications thereof."

The colposcopist, armed with current knowledge and guided by a diagnostic and therapeutic protocol, should be able to avoid them (summarized in Table 1)."
CD008054,0,8392675,0,Management of the patient with an abnormal Papanicolaou test. Recent developments.,"Based on available data, virtually all cervical cancers and the majority of their high-grade precursors (Hi-SIL/CIN 2-3) contain sexually transmitted oncogenic HPV types, among these the most common type is HPV type 16. In current practice, the most cost-effective diagnostic and therapeutic means for Hi-SIL/CIN lesions is LEEP. Judgment must be exercised, however, to tailor the depth of electroexcision of cervical cancer precursors, particularly with respect to the low-grade variants, according to the position of their endocervical lesional margin. About half of the low-grade lesions also carry intermediate- to high-risk oncogenic viruses; unfortunately, morphology cannot identify them unless abnormal mitotic figures are present on the histologic sections. When sophisticated, low-cost viral probing tests and perhaps Cervicography become available, it may be pertinent to determine whether a low-grade lesion contains low-risk virus or is associated with a high- to intermediate-risk virus group. Indeed, the former are unlikely to progress to invasion and may, in fact, regress without therapy other than multiple biopsies, whereas the latter carry high-risk carcinoma potential. Treating long-term monogamous men with asymptomatic, subclinical lesions who are partners of HPV-infected women is not considered cost effective, for they do not seem to reinfect each other. Management strategies for patients with HPV infections should not only be therapeutic but also educative, encouraging patients to practice sexual monogamy."

Also the influence of the patients age and tumors pathological features (stage, grade, degree of keratinization) and DNA ploidy on the biological parameters were analysed. AI and MI were assessed on histological sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and the MIB-1LI on specimens stained with rabbit anti-human Ki-67 antibody (DAKO Ltd). Sections stained with MIB-1 antibody were used for assessment of the tumor proliferation pattern. The median age of the patients was 55 years (29-80). The median values for MIB-1LI, AI, MI, AI/MI, were: 52.3%, 1.1%, 1.5, and 0.9, respectively. In the univariate analysis median values for cut-off points were used for MIB-1LI, and AI, however, for other parameters significant cut-off points have been chosen. For MI it was 2.6 and for the AI/MI ratio 0.7. The median time of follow-up was 29 months, with a range of 2-145 months. The univariate analysis showed that tumor stage (p=0.7009), grade (p=0.6660) and AI (p=0.9378) had negligible influence on patients survival. However, MI >2.6 (p=0.0442), AI/MI <or=0.7 (p=0.0190), and random or mixed type of proliferation (p=0.0163) were significant prognostic factors. Cox multivariate analysis showed that MI, AI/MI, degree of keratinization and type of proliferation were significant prognostic factors for cervical cancer patients treated with radiotherapy."
CD008054,0,11902582,0,The promise and peril of surrogate end points in cancer research.,"Both experimental and observational studies of cancer need to have an end point. Traditionally, in aetiological and prevention studies, that end point has been the incidence of cancer itself, whereas in therapeutic trials, the end point is usually time to cancer recurrence or death. But cancer takes a long time to develop in an individual and is rare in the population. Therefore, aetiological studies and prevention trials must be large and lengthy to be meaningful. Similarly, many therapeutic trials require a long follow-up of large numbers of patients. Surrogate end points--markers of preclinical cancer or of imminent recurrence--are therefore an attractive alternative. But how can we be sure that a study with a surrogate outcome gives us the right answer about the true end point?"
CD008054,0,18784830,0,Papanicolaou test in the detection of high-grade cervical lesions: a re-evaluation based on cytohistologic non-correlation rates in 356 concurrently obtained samples.,"Studies evaluating the routine Papanicolaou (Pap) test have traditionally used as the reference gold standard, the diagnoses on the follow-up histologic samples. Since the latter are typically obtained days to weeks after the Pap test, the accuracy of the resultant comparison may be affected by interim factors, such as regression of human papillomavirus, new lesion acquisitions or colposcopy-associated variability. A subset of our clinicians have routinely obtained cervical cytology samples immediately prior to their colposcopic procedures, which presented a unique opportunity to re-evaluate the test performance of liquid-based cervical cytology in detecting the most clinically significant lesions (i.e. cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or worse: CIN2+), using as gold standard, diagnoses on cervical biopsies that were essentially obtained simultaneously. For each patient, cytohistologic non-correlation between the Pap test and biopsy was considered to be present when either modality displayed a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL)/CIN2+ while the other displayed a less severe lesion. Therefore, HGSIL/CIN2+ was present in both the Pap test and biopsy in true positives, and absent in both modalities in true negatives. In false positives, the Pap test showed HGSIL while the biopsy showed less than a CIN2+. In false negatives, Pap tests displaying less than a HGSIL were associated with biopsies displaying CIN2+. Combinations associated with ""atypical"" interpretations were excluded. A cytohistologic non-correlation was present in 17 (4.8%) of the 356 combinations reviewed. The non-correlation was attributed, by virtue of having the less severe interpretation, to the Pap test in all 17 cases. There were 17, 322, 0, and 17 true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the Pap test, at a diagnostic threshold of HGSIL, in identifying a CIN2+ lesion were 50%, 100%, 100% and 95% respectively. Even in Pap test/biopsy combinations obtained on the same day by the same colposcopist and evaluated by the same pathologist, there is a 4.8% (17/356) false negative rate associated with the Pap test. Our findings suggest that there may be an intrinsic error rate associated with this test modality."
CD008054,0,18990005,0,Aetiology of cancer in Asia.,"Cancer has become the leading cause of death in many Asian countries. There is an increasing trend in breast, prostate and colon cancers, which are considered as typical of economically developed countries. Although breast and prostate cancer rates are still lower than in western countries, they are particularly rapidly increasing. In this paper, we review recently published literature to identify important etiologic factors affecting the cancer risk in Asian populations. Infectious agents such as Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B and C viruses, and human papillomavirus were shown to be associated with elevated risks of stomach, liver and cervical cancer, respectively. Tobacco smoking was shown to be significantly associated with higher lung cancer risk and moderately increased all cancer risk. Excessive alcohol drinking appeared to increase the risk of colorectal cancer in Japanese and breast cancer in the Korean population. Betel nut chewing was associated with higher risk of oral and esophageal cancer. In terms of diet, various studies have demonstrated that high caloric and fat intake was associated with breast cancer risk, salted food intake with stomach cancer, aflatoxin B1 with liver cancer, and low fruits and vegetables intake with breast and lung cancer. Environmental exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution, arsenic, radon, asbestos and second hand smoke was shown to increase the lung cancer risk. Reproductive factors such as late age at first childbirth, early menarche, late menopause, oral contraceptive intake, and short duration of lifetime lactation were shown to be associated with breast and/or colorectal cancer. Cancer has clearly become an emerging health threat in Asia and cancer control programs should be actively implemented and evaluated in this region. Various strategies for cancer control have been developed in some Asian countries, including the set-up of national cancer registries, cancer screening programs, education programs for health behavior change, eradication of Helicobacter pylori and vaccination for hepatitis B and C viruses, and human papilloma virus high risk forms. However, more attention should also be paid to low- and medium-resource Asian countries where cancer incidence rates are high, but neither intensive research on cancer for planning effective cancer control programs, nor easy implementation of such programs are available, due to limited financial resources."
CD008054,0,18990006,0,Role of tobacco in the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in an eastern Indian population.,"The head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) accounts for about 30-40% of all cancer types in India and the subcontinent in general. HNSCCs are primarily not hereditary, but rather a disease of older and middle aged adults. Many etiological factors like tobacco, alcohol and HPV infection are known to play important roles. Eastern India, particularly Kolkata, has a population heavily exposed to various types of smoked and smokeless tobacco, with only limited exposure to alcoholic beverages. Since there have been no previous epidemiological studies on tobacco as the main risk factor for head and neck carcinogenesis in Kolkata, we here carried out a hospital based case control study in the city and its adjoin regions. Data from 110 patients diagnosed with HNSCC and a similar number of matched control samples were analyzed using the chi-square test. Survival status of the patients was also analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. A tobacco habit was significantly correlated with the incidence of HNSCC and persons with current addiction had a 2.17 fold increased risk of cancer development. Dose-response relationships were seen for the frequency (p=0.01) and duration (p=0.02) of tobacco exposure with the risk. No significant difference in impact was found with smoked as opposed to smokeless tobacco in the development of the disease. Among HNSCC patients, significant poor survival in cases with tobacco habit than in those with no addiction and in cases with >10 years of addiction than in those with 10 years of addiction. Our data suggest that tobacco in both smoked and smokeless forms is the most important risk factor for both development and prognosis of HNSCCs and may be a major source of field cancerization on the head and neck epithelium in the eastern Indian population."
CD008054,0,17433234,0,[Preventing papillomavirus infectious and herpes zoster: new vaccines].,"Two new vaccines have been recently licensed : a quadrivalent vaccine against Human papillomavirus infections (HPV) 6, 11, 16 and 18, recommended to children from 9 years old and to young adults under the age of 26 years, and a vaccine against herpes zoster for adults from 60 years old onwards. A bivalent vaccine against HPV 16 and 18 will be shortly available. HPV vaccines are composed of the L1 structural proteins of 2 or 4 HPV genotypes, produced by genetic engineering and self-assembled. These inert vaccines are devoid of genetic materials and mimic the viral particle (virus-like particle, VLP). They allow, as suggested by the 4.5 to 5 years follow-up, to prevent HPV infections and the onset of pre-cancerous lesions associated with genotypes contained within the vaccine. They represent a major overhang in the vaccinology field, and, as anti-hepatitis B vaccine, will probably be effective in cancer prevention. Their use must be associated with the continued detection of cervix cancer by smears and also with the prevention of other sexually transmitted diseases. The herpes zoster vaccine is a living attenuated vaccine produced from the OKA/Merck strain already used in the vaccine against varicella. Its safety is good among persons 50 years old and over and its efficiency on lowering herpes zoster incidence, on the burden of illness and on post-herpetic neuralgia has been demonstrated in persons over 60 years old."

Despite advances in the management of patients with this disease, the survival rate has not been significantly improved. Several mechanisms of carcinogenesis have been elucidated and molecular targeted agents seem to be promising therapeutic tools. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the EGF receptor, improves survival rates in association with radiotherapy in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) or in palliative disease, and is nowadays the only targeted agent approved in this indication. Other targeted agents are also clinically relevant to the treatment of different malignancies, including SCCHN.

It provides guidance on how to manage women with abnormal cervical cytology. Throughout this article the Bethesda system is used for cervical cytology terminology, as the European guidelines have recommended that all systems should at least be translated into that terminology while cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is used for histological biopsies (Cytopathology 2007; 18:213-9). A woman with a high-grade cytological lesion, a repeated low-grade lesion or with an equivocal cytology result and a positive human papillomavirus (HPV) test should be referred for colposcopy. The role of the colposcopist is to identify the source of the abnormal cells and to make an informed decision as to whether or not any treatment is required. If a patient requires treatment the colposcopist will decide which is the most appropriate method of treatment for each individual woman. The colposcopist should also organize appropriate follow-up for each woman seen. Reflex testing for high-risk HPV types of women with atypical squamous cells (ASC) of undetermined significance with referral for colposcopy of women who test positive is a first option. Repeat cytology is a second possibility. Direct referral to a gynaecologist should be restricted to special circumstances. Follow-up of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion is more difficult because currently there is no evidence to support any method of management as being optimal; repeat cytology and colposcopy are options, but HPV testing is not sufficiently selective, unless for older women. Women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) should be referred without triage. Women with glandular lesions require particular attention. In a subsequent issue of Cytopathology, the second part of Chapter 6 will be presented, with recommendations for management and treatment of histologically confirmed intraepithelial neoplasia and guidance for follow-up of special cases such as women who are pregnant, postmenopausal or immunocompromised."

CD008054,0,11048810,0,Anaplastic large cell lymphomas presented as bone lesions: a clinicopathologic study of six cases and review of the literature.,"Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas uncommonly present as bone lesions. Most of these tumors are diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) presented as bone lesions is exceedingly rare. In this study, we describe six cases of ALCL that presented as solitary or multiple bone lesions. The average patient age was 33 years (range, 4 to 63 years) and the male to female ratio was 2:1. Fever and localized bone pain were the most frequent presenting symptoms. Radiologic examinations revealed osteolytic lesions in all cases, with three (50%) being multiple lesions and five (83%) involving the axial bones. All patients were initially assessed to have only bone involvement. Staging studies revealed mild cervical lymphadenopathy in one patient and no evidence of extraskeletal disease in the other five patients. Histologically, there was diffuse infiltration of one or more bones by large pleomorphic lymphoma cells. Immunohistochemical studies showed all six neoplasms were positive for CD30, EMA, and granzyme B. One case was of T-cell lineage, positive for CD3. One case was positive for the T-cell-associated antigen CD4. The remaining four cases were of null-cell type. In-situ hybridization for EBV was performed in five cases; all were negative. Despite the relatively low International Prognostic Index (IPI) of these patients (mean, 1.67; range, 1 to 3), the overall prognosis was relatively poor: three of six died of disease within 2 years of diagnosis, and two of six were alive with evidence of disease (follow-up, 6 mo to 2 years). Thus, compared to their nodal counterparts, ALCLs that present as bone lesions are distinguished by their uniform expression of EMA and granzyme B, and a relatively poor clinical outcome. Our results also suggest that ALK-1 expression in this clinical setting is not a favorable prognostic indicator."

CD008054,0,9638386,0,A risk-benefit assessment of irinotecan in solid tumours.,"Irinotecan is a water-soluble camptothecin analogue. Its cytotoxicity effects are exerted through interaction with the topoisomerase I-DNA complex, eventually leading to cell death. In preclinical studies, irinotecan has demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity in vitro and in vivo, and synergistic effects have been observed when it is administered in combination with other antineoplastic agents. Phase I studies of irinotecan conducted in Europe, Japan and the US have provided useful information on optimal dosage and scheduling, as well as thorough evaluation of the toxicity profile of the drug. Phase II and III trials utilising either irinotecan alone or in innovative combinations with other drugs are currently in progress. Available data indicate that irinotecan alone or in combination with other cytotoxic agents has therapeutic potential in several types of malignancy, including colorectal, lung, ovarian, cervical and gastric cancers and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is the first drug since fluorouracil to possess consistent antitumour activity against metastatic colorectal cancer. The principal toxicities associated with irinotecan are diarrhoea and leucopenia. Effective strategies have been developed to circumvent both the early- and delayed-onset diarrhoea induced by irinotecan, thus allowing safer delivery of this promising agent in the clinical setting."

Circulating Tg mRNA was found in 13 of 34 patients, 5 of 13 with detectable and 8 of 13 with undetectable sTg. From these 8 patients with undetectable Tg, 6 showed no cervical radioiodine uptake, and 3 presented proven metastatic disease (2 of them positive for antithyroglobulin antibodies). NIS mRNA was detected in 11 of 34 patients, but its measurement did not improve the ability to detect patients with metastases. Overall, identification of metastatic thyroid cancer was better associated with Tg mRNA than with NIS mRNA, sTg, or whole body scan (83% vs. 16.6% vs. 50% vs. 50%; P < 0.001). These data showed that circulating Tg mRNA is not only a more sensitive marker of residual thyroid tissue or thyroid cancer than sTg, particularly in patients during T4 therapy and with positive antithyroglobulin antibodies, but also was more sensitive than NIS mRNA in all patients."

High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types, such as 16 and 18, are consistently identified in Filipino women with cervical cancer. Factors identified to increase the likelihood of HPV infection and subsequent development of cervical cancer include young age at first intercourse, low socioeconomic status, high parity, smoking, use of oral contraception and risky sexual behaviors. Cancer screening programs presently available in the Philippines include Pap smears, single visit approach utilizing visual inspection with acetic acid followed by cryotherapy, as well as colposcopy. However, the uptake of screening remains low and is further compounded by the lack of basic knowledge women have regarding screening as an opportunity for prevention of cervical cancer. Prophylactic HPV vaccination of both quadrivalent and bivalent vaccines has already been approved in the Philippines and is gaining popularity among the Filipinos. However, there has been no national or government vaccination policy implemented as of yet. The standard of treatment of cervical cancer is radiotherapy concurrent with chemotherapy. Current researches are directed towards improving availability of both preventive and curative measures of cervical cancer management."

After 4 years, excluding those for whom there was no follow up, 5.8% of those with a history of abnormal smears, none of those with a clinical history of genital warts or herpes virus and 1.1% of controls had developed histological evidence of at least cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (CINIII) when referred for investigation of subsequent abnormal smears; one woman, from the control group, had developed invasive cervical cancer. Women with two negative smears after a history of abnormal smears who subsequently developed CINIII were more likely to have had a previous smear reported as moderate or mild-moderate dyskaryosis (2/6) compared with those whose follow up was negative (2/89). The results suggest that two negative cervical smears may not necessarily indicate that a lesion has regressed, but that a clinical history of genital warts or herpes virus infection should not be an indication for increased surveillance."

The study was performed to determine the frequency of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in the various cytologic groups and to assess the effect of testing for human papillomavirus on the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of these tests.Results: Papanicolaou smears that included all non-negative tests (high- and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and atypical squamous or glandular epithelial cells of undetermined significance) had the maximal sensitivity (89%) for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer. The combined cytologic categories of high- and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions had a sensitivity of 58%, this was reduced to 24% if only high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were considered relevant for additional evaluation. If we had not evaluated the patients with atypical squamous and glandular cells of undetermined significance, we would have missed diagnosing one third of high-grade and one half of low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Cervical cytology was false negative in 8% of patients with high-grade and in 14% of those with low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasias. High-risk human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid was detected in 40% of women with high-grade and in 24% of those with low-grade grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasias. The positive predictive value of cytology with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance increased from 5% to 38% for high-grade and from 30 to 85% for high- and low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasias in patients with detectable high-risk human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid. Virologic studies produced no significant improvement on these diagnoses in women with high- or low-grade cytology.Conclusions: Because of the poor sensitivity of cytology suggesting high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, we recommend that all women with atypical or low-grade cytology be recalled for colposcopy and high-risk human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing, if available. Decisions whether to perform a biopsy should be based on the result of colposcopic examination. Performing colposcopy only on those patients who have cytologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and following those with lower grade cytologic anomalies without colposcopic diagnosis appears inadequate to rule out high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia."

Two prophylactic HPV vaccines are licensed in >100 countries, and immunization programs in young, adolescent girls have been widely implemented. HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (Cervarix; GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) has demonstrated type-specific protection against the five most frequent cancer-causing types (16, 18, 31, 33, and 45) that are responsible for 82% of invasive cervical cancers globally. Cervarix has demonstrated efficacy against HPV-45, which is the third most common HPV type in cervical cancer and adenocarcinoma. Final results of a large phase 3 trial recently showed Cervarix substantially reduced the overall burden of cervical precancerous lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+) by 70.2% in an HPV-naÃ¯ve population approximating young girls prior to sexual debut, the target of most current vaccination programs. Protection offered by Cervarix against nonvaccine types (mainly 31, 33, and 45) might potentially allow for 11%-16% additional protection against cervical cancers, compared to a vaccine only offering protection against HPV-16/18. Another recent study directly compared the antibody response of Cervarix to that of quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (Gardasil; Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA). Cervarix induced significantly superior neutralizing antibody levels as compared with Gardasil for HPV-16 and HPV-18 in all age groups studied. This may translate into more women having detectable (neutralizing) antibodies in cervicovaginal secretions for HPV-16 and HPV-18 after vaccination with Cervarix when compared with Gardasil. Cervarix induced significantly higher frequencies of antigen-specific memory B-cells and T-cells in responders for HPV-16 and HPV-18 as compared with Gardasil. Cervarix continues to show sustained high levels of total and neutralizing antibodies for HPV-16 and HPV-18, 7.3 years after vaccination. This is associated with high efficacy and no breakthrough cases in the HPV-naÃ¯ve population, and is the longest duration follow-up for safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy for any licensed HPV vaccine to date."
CD008054,0,20837404,0,Genetic variation in DNA repair pathway genes and melanoma risk.,"Reduced DNA repair capacity has been proposed as a predisposing factor for melanoma. We comprehensively evaluated 1463 genetic variants across 60 DNA repair-related pathway genes in relation to melanoma risk in a nested case-control study of 218 melanoma cases (20% on head and neck) and 218 matched controls within the Nurses' Health Study (NHS). We then genotyped the two variants with the smallest P value in two replication sets: 184 melanoma cases (28% on head and neck) and 184 matched controls in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS); and 183 melanoma cases (10% on head and neck) and 183 matched controls in the NHS. The SNP rs3219125 in the PARP1 gene was significantly associated with melanoma risk in the discovery set (odds ratio (OR) 3.14; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.70-5.80) and in the HPFS replication set (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.05-3.54) but not in the NHS replication set (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.58-1.97). In the joint analysis, the OR was 1.89 (95% CI, 1.34-2.68) for this polymorphism, and this increased risk was more pronounced among patients with lesions in head/neck (OR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.77-5.73 for head/neck, and OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.03-2.30 for other sites, P value for heterogeneity test=0.036).

Cervical cancer and oral cancer are closely associated with specific types of HPV, and the tumors grow only if there is continual expression of the viral E6 and E7 genes. Evidence from in vitro studies shows that when expression of these genes is inhibited by gene therapy approaches such as antisense RNA, ribozymes, or siRNA, the transformed phenotype of the cells is lost. Although it seems possible that clinical applications of this approach could help in the management of cervical and oral cancers there have been no clinical trials of gene therapy for HPV-associated cancers.

We evaluated the performance of 4 HPV DNA tests, namely, HC II, Linear Array (LA), DNA chip, and cycle sequencing for their capacity to detect the presence of high-risk HPV DNA and HPV-associated cervical lesions. Seventy-six women who were referred to the colposcopy clinic for abnormal cytology were enrolled. The women were examined using liquid-based cytology, colposcopy-directed biopsy, and HPV DNA tests. After DNA extraction from a single sample, HPV DNA tests were performed by all 4 methods on the same specimen. The LA test has higher HPV-positive rates than HC II for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I (83.3% vs 61.1%; P < 0.01) and for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II and more severe lesions (100.0% vs 80.0%; P < 0.01). The concordance between the DNA chip and LA tests was 89.5%, confirming substantial agreement (kappa coefficient = 0.73), and the concordance between HC II and the DNA chip was 80.3%, also showing substantial agreement (kappa coefficient = 0.738). The concordance for 15 high-risk HPV genotypes between LA and sequencing was 82.5% with a kappa value of 0.536. Furthermore, the LA test was more sensitive in the detection of high-grade cervical lesions than HC II (100% vs 92.3%, P < 0.01). The LA test showed superior sensitivity in the detection of clinically relevant HPV infections and has proven to be an accurate tool for identifying individual HPV types, especially in cases of multiple HPV infections."

For that, 412 women with a cytological diagnosis of LSIL at entry were monitored by cytology, HR-HPV testing with the Hybrid Capture II assay (HC-II) and colposcopy. Our primary endpoint was clinical progression defined by the presence of a high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2 and CIN3) at the biopsy. At baseline, histological control revealed 10 CIN2 and 11 CIN3 only in the cohort of women HR-HPV+. In the follow-up, 4 CIN2 and 8 CIN3 were detected, always in the women initially HR-HPV+. Thus, the recurrence of a HR-HPV+ infection clearly selects a population at high-risk for CIN2-3. The semi-quantitative appreciation of the viral load with HC-II could not be used as a good prognostic factor for the follow-up of women with LSIL. HR-HPV testing reduces the number of cytology and colposcopy examinations in the follow-up of women aged >35 years when HPV testing is initially negative. Thus HR-HPV testing should be reserved for the follow-up of this population of women initially HR-HPV+ and proposed 6 to 12 months after the cytological diagnosis of LSIL."

In this study, we analyzed concurrent cervical smears and biopsies from 167 patients with Papanicolaou (Pap) smears showing persistent atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASCUS) or low grade SILs (1) to compare the detection of HPV by nonisotopic in situ hybridization (NISH) on matched smears and biopsies; (2) to analyze the type and distribution of NISH signal within lesions; and (3) to define further the ability of NISH techniques to distinguish between patients with low- and high-grade SIL. Whether present in cervical smears or biopsies, high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, and related types) were significantly associated with high-grade SILs (P < .001) but were found in 15% of low-grade SILs. Ninety percent of high grade lesions were directly infected by these HPV types, and good concordance (92.2%) was found between NISH analysis of matched cervical smears and biopsies, indicating accurate colposcopic targetting of biopsies and excision specimens. Punctate signal morphology, which correlates with viral integration, was associated with high-grade SILs but was also observed in two low-grade SILs. Although the presence of high-risk HPV types in low-grade SILs limits the predictive ability of HPV testing by this means in this group of patients, those patients with high-risk HPV infection of low-grade SILs may be a greater risk of progression to high-grade SIL or invasive carcinoma. If this were the case, HPV testing would be of potential value in the management of patients with low-grade cytological abnormalities."

The expression of hTERT in a large population of 153 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer was analyzed using the in situ hybridization technique. We found that diffuse and clear hTERT expression was present in 51 (33%) of 153 patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that hTERT expression was associated with shorter overall survival (P = 0.04), shorter disease-specific survival (P = 0.03), and shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.02). Multivariate analysis confirmed this independent prognostic value of hTERT expression.

Screening programmes for cancer of the cervix have been very effective in many developed countries but in very few developing countries. In general, the failures in developing countries can be directly related to failure to achieve adequate quality in one or other component of a programme. Some of these failures occur at the level of the laboratory, but in several Latin American countries, there are superb laboratories, but overall the programme has failed to achieve the expected impact. In some countries this has led to alternatives to the cytology smear being evaluated, without recognition that it is not the test that has failed, but another essential component of an effective programme. The solution is attention to management and organisation at all levels, with quality assurance at each. This is required at the level of: definition of the target population, identification of the individual women in the target population, recruitment of the at risk woman to screening, administration of the screening test, laboratory examination of the test, communication of results from the laboratory to the woman and her physician, ensuring the woman attends for investigation and management of abnormal screening tests, ensuring adequate therapy of lesions identified by the diagnostic process, ensuring adequate follow-up of treated women, ensuring women with negative screening tests return for re-screening at the appropriate intervals, and monitoring and evaluation of the programme."

We investigated the timing of diagnosis of histologic cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) using data from the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance-low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion triage study (ALTS). Of the 2,725 women who underwent enrollment colposcopy, 412 of 472 (87.3%) diagnosed with histologic CIN3+ over the 2-year duration of ALTS could be assigned to a HPV type or group of types and were included in this analysis. Eighty-four percent of HPV16-positive CIN3+ were diagnosed at enrollment, compared with 57% of HPV18/45-positive CIN3+, and 58% of CIN3 positive for other carcinogenic HPV types at enrollment. In contrast, only 8% of HPV16-positive CIN3+ were diagnosed at exit, whereas 31% were HPV18/45 positive and 22% were positive for other carcinogenic types at study exit (P < 0.001).

To date few studies examining the usefulness of p16 immunocytochemistry in atypical squamous cells which cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H), compared with ASC-US in liquid-based cervical smears. Therefore, we examined the correlation of p16 immunocytochemical staining with follow-up biopsy results on ASC-H categorized smears and compared the data with those classified as ASC-US on 105 liquid-based cytology samples. We found no statistical significance in the p16 expression of ASC-US smears and the presence of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) in follow-up biopsies (p = 0.546). However, p16 expression did significantly correlate with the presence of SIL (p = 0.002) in ASC-H smears. There was a statistically significant relationship between p16 expression and presence of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) or more on the follow-up biopsies in both ASC-US (p = 0.012) and ASC-H (p < 0.001) categorized smears. In ASC-US categorized smears, there was no statistical significance between p16 expression and the HR-HPV viral load (p = 0.091). But there was a statistical significance between p16 expression and the HR-HPV viral load (p < 0.001) in ASC-H categorized smears.

Cohort participants acquired 189 anal HPV infections, 113 of which cleared during the study period. The most frequently acquired HPV genotypes were HPV-52, -53, -84, and -16. Women in the highest quartile of trans-zeaxanthin, trans -anhydro-lutein, and trans-, cis-, and total Î²-carotene had significant 43% to 50% reduction in the risk of acquisition of any HPV infection compared with women in the lowest quartile. Few associations were observed between micronutrient levels and clearance of transient (â¤ 150 days) anal HPV infections. However, clearance of persistent (> 150 days) infections was associated with higher levels of Î²-tocopherol + Î³-tocopherol and lower levels of carotenoids and retinol. Our findings suggest that several carotenoids can reduce the risk and clearance of anal HPV infections that contribute to anal cancer."
CD008054,0,16406731,1,[ASCUS: an update].,"A report of ASCUS is always confusing or painful to the clinician, as histological correlate of this diagnosis is wide, ranging from a totally normal cervix mucosa to infiltrating carcinoma; most of the time it is the result of benign inflammatory or reactive changes. This is the reason why this category has evolved since its introduction in the Bethesda system for reporting cervical cytology in 1988, to achieve a closer link to the lesional diagnosis. The most recent modification took place in 2001, to subcategorize the ASC into ASC-US and ASC-H. The present review provides guidelines to manage these diagnoses."
CD008054,0,11139314,0,Detection of p73 antibodies in patients with various types of cancer: immunological characterization.,"p53 antibodies have been found in the sera of patients with various types of cancer. The presence of these antibodies is generally associated with p53 accumulation in the tumour that is believed to trigger this humoral response. The recent discovery of 2 new members of the p53 family, p73 and p63, led us to study the specificity of this immune response towards the 3 proteins. Serum samples from 148 patients with various types of cancer were tested for antibodies against p73 and p63 using immunoprecipitation. 72 patients were previously shown to have p53 antibodies whereas 76 were negative. The control group consisted of 50 blood donors. p73 were detected in 22/148 (14.9%) of the cancer patients (11/72 in the group with p53-antibodies and 11/76 in the negative group). Only two sera from the control (4%) were positive. p63 antibodies were detected in only 4/148 (2.7%) of the cancer patients. Epitope mappings were performed and demonstrate that p73 antibodies are directed toward the central region of the p73 protein whereas p53 antibodies react predominantly toward the amino- and the carboxy-terminus of p53. Our results indicate that there is a specific immune response toward the p73 protein in cancer patients, a finding supported by an increasing number of publications describing p73 accumulation in tumoral cells."
CD008054,0,16765101,1,Trial of management of borderline and other low-grade abnormal smears (TOMBOLA): Trial design.,"Cervical screening reduces the risk of cervical cancer by detecting and treating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The management of women with low-grade cervical abnormalities is controversial. Two management policies exist: repeat smears in primary care and colposcopy examination. It is not clear which of these is the more effective and efficient. There is also uncertainty as to the most effective and efficient management of women at colposcopy when an area of abnormality is seen on the cervix - immediate treatment or biopsy and selective recall for treatment if the biopsy result suggests this is necessary. The result of a human papillomavirus (HPV) test might assist in deciding the appropriate management of women with low-grade abnormalities. TOMBOLA, a pragmatic randomised-controlled trial set within the cervical screening programmes in Scotland and England, addresses these three areas of uncertainty. Almost four and a half thousand women aged 20-59 with a low-grade cervical abnormality have been recruited and randomised to either repeat smears or colposcopy examination. Women in the colposcopy arm of the trial are further randomised to a policy of either immediate treatment or biopsy and selective recall for treatment if they have an abnormal transformation zone. Women are followed up to an exit examination at 3 years. HPV testing is undertaken at recruitment and at the exit examination. The primary endpoint is cumulative incidence of CIN2/3. A range of other clinical, psychosocial and economic outcomes is being considered. This paper describes the design of the trial, and discusses the rationale underlying aspects of the design and the challenges faced in designing and implementing the trial."
CD008054,0,17192039,0,Early non-invasive diagnosis of cervical cancer: beyond Pap smears and human papilloma virus (HPV) testing.,"Cervical cancer is a major gynecologic malignancy around the world. However, current diagnostic methods such as Pap smear and human papilloma virus (HPV) testing are insufficient for an early diagnosis of cervical cancer, follow-up on therapy efficacy or to identify the women who might progress to cervical cancer (only about 1-5% of the HPV-positive women will develop cervical cancer). Patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) clearly need a better screening test. Developing a non-invasive method for early diagnosis of cervical cancer is essential. Our in vitro and translational research data support the hypothesis that: 1. Squamous cell cervical cancer is related to specific upregulation of tissue and serum Insulin-like Growth Factor-II levels (IGF-II; 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity). Serum IGF-I, but not IGF-II levels are elevated in other gynecological, breast, lung and prostate cancers. Serum IGF-II test helps in diagnosing cervical cancer as early as ASC-US or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-I and in monitoring therapy efficacy (p < 0.001 by Student's 't' test and Chi-square analysis). 2. Concomittant to increased serum IGF-II levels, IGF-Binding Protein 3 (IGF-BP3) levels are significantly decreased in persistent CIN and cervical cancer (p < 0.0001). As IGF-BP3 modulates IGF-II biological activity, significantly decreased serum IGF-BP3 levels (levels normalize after therapy; p < 0.001) may indicate a poor prognosis. Similar to serum IGF-II, serum IGF-BP3 levels help monitoring therapy efficacy in cervical cancer and advanced CIN. Measurement of serum IGF-II levels will help in early diagnosis of cervical cancer and monitoring of therapy outcome. Serum IGF-BP3 in conjunction with IGF-II levels may help in predicting prognosis as well as monitoring therapy efficacy."

CD008054,0,18486742,0,Head and neck cancer.,"Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas that develop in the upper aerodigestive epithelium after exposure to carcinogens such as tobacco and alcohol. Human papillomavirus has also been strongly implicated as a causative agent in a subset of these cancers. The complex anatomy and vital physiological role of the tumour-involved structures dictate that the goals of treatment are not only to improve survival outcomes but also to preserve organ function. Major improvements have been accomplished in surgical techniques and radiotherapy delivery. Moreover, systemic therapy including chemotherapy and molecularly targeted agents--namely, the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors--has been successfully integrated into potentially curative treatment of locally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. In deciding which treatment strategy would be suitable for an individual patient, important considerations include expected functional outcomes, ability to tolerate treatment, and comorbid illnesses. The collaboration of many specialties is the key for optimum assessment and decision making. We review the epidemiology, molecular pathogenesis, diagnosis and staging, and the latest multimodal management of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck."

Clinicopathologic correlation and demonstration of human papillomavirus by in situ hybridization.,"It has been suggested that invasive cervical carcinoma is biologically more aggressive in young patients than in older patients. The clinicopathologic characteristics and human papillomavirus (HPV) status of women < or = 35 years of age with invasive cervical carcinoma treated at Emory University Hospital from 1985-1989, were evaluated in a retrospective study. The group consisted of 23 patients, 35% of all patients with invasive cervical carcinoma. Age at diagnosis, clinical stage, histologic classification, lymph node status, treatment and clinical follow-up were obtained from medical records. HPV status was evaluated by colorimetric in situ hybridization for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33 and 35 in archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor material available from 16 of the patients. This study found that the young patients had lower survival and greater extent of disease than predicted by clinical staging. The rate of detection of HPV (69% positive) and HPV typing (type 16 predominated) in these young patients showed no difference from other series of cervical carcinomas from all age groups. Although a higher proportion of patients who died of disease had HPV-negative tumors (3/7, 43%) than those patients who were alive and free of disease (2/9, 22%), this difference was not statistically significant (P = .73, Fisher's Exact T-Test)."

The DNA ploidy status and the cell proliferation activity analyzed by flow cytometry give us complementary information about the prognosis and the management and support of the patients. We performed a study of 91 cases of carcinoma of the larynx and pharynx by means of flow cytometry. Forty-three patients were treated by surgery alone, and 48 patients also received radiotherapy. Fifty-five were aneuploid (60%); this percentage increased to 74% in the pharynx area and fell to 47% at the larynx level. The aneuploid tumors showed worse behavior in the patients treated by surgery alone compared with those who also received radiotherapy. The S-phase fraction was high in aneuploid tumors, in positive lymph nodes, and in advanced stages. The S-phase fraction was higher in poorly differentiated tumors. In patients treated by surgery alone, we noticed that by combining both cytometric variables two different kinetic profiles could be defined related to the patients' behavior. The diploid tumors with a low S phase had the greatest rates of survival, whereas diploid tumors with a high rate of S phase and aneuploids had a lower rate."

Incidence rates of invasive cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers were analyzed with respect to age, race, year of diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, and histopathology. The incidence of metachronous primary cancers following initial primaries of the cervix was also investigated. Anogenital cancers constituted about 4% of all cancers in Michigan women between 1985 and 1992. Age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 women per year for each site were found to be as follows: 10.1 (cervix), 1.9 (vulva), 1.0 (vagina), and 0.6 (anus). The incidence rates of women in the United States for cancers in the anogenital region were higher in blacks than in whites, with the exception of vulvar cancer. U.S. blacks were more likely to develop squamous cell carcinomas, but less likely to develop adenocarcinomas of the cervix and vagina when compared to whites. Over the 5- to 8-year follow-up period, 6.5% of the women with index cases of cervical cancer developed second primary cancers. This represented a 40% increase in the risk of incident primary cancers compared to the risk in the general population of Michigan women. The significant occurrence of second primaries of the vagina following index primaries of the cervix suggests a shared etiology, such as infection with human papillomavirus. The incidences of cancers related to smoking, including cancers of the urinary bladder, lung/bronchus, and lower anogenital tract were also increased."

A case-control study of Washington State women who presented for routine gynecologic care from 1997 to 2001 was conducted. All women underwent cytologic testing and HPV DNA screening. Those with abnormal cytology findings or a positive oncogenic HPV test and a random sample of women negative on both tests were referred for colposcopically directed cervical biopsy with repeated testing. Among 461 women with oncogenic HPV were 181 controls with negative histology, 137 cases with histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1 (CIN1), and 143 cases with histologically confirmed CIN grades 2-3 or higher (>/= CIN2-3). Smoking information was obtained by questionnaire. Immunohistochemistry testing for Ki-67 was performed on a subset of biopsy specimens (n = 139). Smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day was associated with >/= CIN2-3 (adjusted odds ratio = 2.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.3, 5.5) and CIN1 (adjusted odds ratio = 2.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.2, 5.3). Heavy smoking was positively associated with Ki-67 but not with repeated detection of oncogenic HPV. Since smoking was associated with both CIN1 and >/= CIN2-3, cigarette by-products may affect the early evolution of HPV-related lesions, possibly by increasing the rate of cell turnover."
CD008054,0,20006487,0,"Multimodal approach using oncolytic adenovirus, cetuximab, chemotherapy and radiotherapy in HNSCC low passage tumour cell cultures.","Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common and often devastating disease without curative treatment when advanced or recurrent. The aim of this study was to assess whether capsid-modified oncolytic adenoviruses have therapeutic efficacy in HNSCC low passage tumour cell cultures and if it could be further improved by combination with cetuximab, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We investigated which adenoviral capsid modifications allow best gene transfer and cell killing of HNSCC substrates. Gene transfer was assessed using replication-deficient adenoviruses expressing luciferase. Cell killing was studied in vitro and in vivo using oncolytic adenoviruses, which kill tumour cell by viral replication. The most effective capsid-modified oncolytic adenoviruses were combined with HNSCC standard therapies and their efficacy was assessed in vitro as well as in vivo. Cell killing was assessed in vitro by MTS assay and in vivo by HNSCC subcutaneous tumour growth follow-up in nude mice. Cetuximab treatment was found to enrich CD133+ and CD44+ tumour-initiating type cells in tumours grown in mice. Capsid-modified viruses showed increased transduction and oncolysis of HNSCC substrates in comparison to Ad5-based agents. Polylysine (pK7)-modified oncolytic virus resulted in significant tumour growth reduction in vivo. Combination of chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil), radiotherapy and cetuximab with oncolytic adenovirus therapy resulted in further increases in cell killing effect in vitro and complete eradication of tumours in vivo. Our pre-clinical data suggest that it is feasible and efficacious to combine oncolytic adenoviruses with HNSCC standard therapies into a multimodality treatment regimen for clinical testing in HNSCC patients."

To date, less than 20 cases have been mentioned. Although the rarity of this diagnosis makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions from limited data, it does seem that SSCC is an aggressive tumor. In this study, we present a 31-year-old patient with abnormal vaginal bleeding. The diagnosis of SSCC was confirmed through pathologic examinations from hysterectomy specimen. Its epithelial origin was demonstrated by immunohistochemical studies. The expression of p53, HER2/neu, and c-kit was not enhanced in this tumor. Importantly, it was human papillomavirus type 16, positive by polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization studies. Enhanced immunostaining for phospho-retinoblastoma protein and decreased apoptosis compared with the squamous cell carcinoma counterpart were observed.

HIV-positive women had a higher percentage of persistent SIL (76%) than HIV-negative women (18%, relative risk (RR)=4.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.4, 7.7). SILs were more frequent among women infected with HPV at the time of enrolment or with persistent HPV infection, but these associations disappeared after adjusting for HIV serostatus.

Forty-nine patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion had higher frequency of high-risk HPV than 167 patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and 63 controls. There was no statistical difference in the frequencies of HER-2 Ile/Ile, Ile/Val, and Val/Val genotypes between squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) and controls. When the Ile/Ile genotype was compared to the Ile/Val + Val/Val genotypes, there was also no statistical difference in the genotype prevalence between SILs and controls either in 91 or 188 patients with or without high-risk HPV, respectively. These results suggest that the HER-2 polymorphism at codon 655 in cervical cell samples is unlikely to be associated with HPV status and the onset of cervical cancer in a Japanese population."

Perinatal exposure to natural (17beta-estradiol [17beta-E(2)]) and synthetic (diethylstilbestrol [DES]) estrogens induces neoplastic changes in humans and rodents. Previous studies demonstrated that neonatal 17beta-E(2) treatment of mice results in increased nuclear DNA content of cervicovaginal epithelium that precedes histologically evident neoplasia. In order to determine whether this effect was associated with chromosomal changes in humans, the frequencies of trisomy of chromosomes 1, 7, 11, and 17 were evaluated by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique in cervicovaginal tissue from 19 DES-exposed and 19 control women. The trisomic frequencies were significantly elevated in 4 of the 19 (21%) DES-exposed patients. One patient presented with trisomy of chromosomes 1, 7, and 11, while trisomy of chromosome 7 was observed in one patient. There were two patients with trisomy of chromosome 1. Trisomy of chromosomes 1, 7, 11, and 17 was not observed in the cervicovaginal tissue taken from control patients.

Screening methods and follow-up schedules for cervical cancer are well known. A golden standard to screen and monitor men does not exist yet, because HPV-related, life threatening malignancies in men are rare. The importance of male HPV screening lies mainly in HPV vaccination. Young females are the target group for HPV, but men are considered to be the reservoir for HPV and to have a role in the perpetuation of the infection in the general population. We looked at the usefulness of urine as a tool for HPV screening. Pubmed was searched with the words ''HPV'', ''Urine,'' and ''HPV-DNA''. The chance of finding HPV-DNA in urine is higher in men with lesions in the urethra than outside the urethra, and in women with abnormal cervical cytology. In general, the results of testing urine for HPV-DNA are better for women than for men, probably because of the anatomical position of the urethra to the vagina, vulva, and cervix. In both genders, urine HPV prevalence is higher in HIV pos patients and in high-risk populations. Urine, to screen asymptomatic low-risk-profile (wo)men seems less useful because their urine samples are often inadequate. If urine proves to be the best medium to screen, a low-risk population remains controversial."

Records of consecutive women undergoing gracilis flap pelvic reconstruction procedures were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-two received classical ""long"" flaps, while 24 received short flaps. In the short gracilis flap modification, the dominant vascular pedicle is deliberately sacrificed. Clinical factors for association with flap-specific complications were analyzed. Eighty-three flaps were used in 46 women for reconstruction after radical pelvic surgery. Those receiving short flaps were more likely to have a preoperative diagnosis of cervical cancer and to have undergone exenteration with rectosigmoid anastomosis, and all short flaps were performed by gynecologic oncologists (all P < 0.05). Distribution of other patient characteristics were similar. Loss of more than one or both flaps occurred in seven (15%) patients, three (14%) with long and four (17%) with short flaps, a nonsignificant difference. Age, weight, tobacco use, associated medical conditions, diagnosis, prior therapy, type of procedure, previous lymphadenectomy, use of bilateral flaps, postoperative abscess/fistula, and type of surgeon were not significantly associated with major flap loss. Four (50%) of eight patients undergoing exenteration with rectosigmoid anastomosis had major flap loss, compared to 2 of 29 with exenteration only, and 1 of 9 with other pelvic reconstructions (P < 0.05). In conclusion, sacrifice of the dominant vascular pedicle in the short gracilis flap does not increase the risk of major flap loss. Vaginal reconstruction after exenteration with rectosigmoid anastomosis significantly increases the risk of this complication."
CD008054,0,20379395,0,Current management strategy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is an unique head and neck cancer. It is common among the southern Chinese and is closely associated with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV). To diagnose the disease in its early stage is infrequent as the symptoms are usually trivial and patients only present in late stages. Testing the blood for elevated EBV DNA has now become a screening test for the high risk group of patients, aiming to diagnose the disease in its early stages. Imaging studies, positron emission tomography scans in addition to clinical examination provide information on the extent of the disease. The confirmation of the disease still depends on endoscopic examination and biopsy. Radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy has been the primary treatment modality. The application of intensity modulated radiotherapy and the use of concomitant chemoradiation have improved the control of nasopharyngeal carcinoma together with the reduction of long term side effects. The early detection of residual or recurrence tumor in the neck or at the primary site has allowed delivery of salvage treatment. The choice of the optimal surgical salvage, either for neck disease or primary tumor depends on the extent of the residual or recurrent disease. The outcome of these patients have improved with the application of the appropriate surgical salvage."

We examined the real usefulness of such typing to determine prognosis of the lesions and correct clinical management. We determined the correlations between human papillomaviruses, as detected by the in situ hybridization method, with the histological grade of 125 cervical lesions (in 106 patients) and the clinical course (mean follow-up = 24 months) in 56% of them. Viruses 16/18 and/or 31/33/55, considered to be potential oncogenes, predominated, whatever the grade, in in situ hybridization positive intraepithelial malpighian lesions (57 out of 59 cases; 97%). In the follow-up cases, there was no difference in the clinical course of the lesions in terms of grade (simple condyloma mild or moderate dysplasia) based on the hybridization results (detection and typing). These findings suggest that routine viral typing cannot be proposed to determine the therapeutic attitude (abstention, destruction) for the management of intraepithelial lesions of the cervix."

The necessary resources, infrastructure, and technological expertise, together with the need for repeated screenings at regular intervals, make cytologic screening difficult to implement in poor countries. As noncytologic approaches for the detection of HPV, simple visual screening methods for anogenital lesions caused by HPV, and the availability of an HPV-16/18 vaccine will enhance the linkage between screening and treatment, multiple factors will need to be considered when designing new, or modifying existing prevention strategies. Countryspecific decisions regarding the best strategy for cervical cancer control will need to rely on data from many sources and take into account complex epidemiologic, economic, social, political, and cultural factors, and be made despite uncertainty and incomplete information. A rigorous decision analytic approach using computerbased modeling methods enables linkage of the knowledge gained from empirical studies to real-world situations. This chapter provides an introduction to these methods, reviews lessons learned from cost-effectiveness analyses of cervical cancer screening in developed and developing countries, and emphasizes important qualitative themes to consider in designing cervical cancer prevention policies."
CD008054,0,19127558,0,Invader human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 and 18 assays as adjuncts to HPV screening of cervical papanicolaou smears with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance.,"High-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is standard practice for triaging women who have Papanicolaou (Pap) smears with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), however, only 5% to 17% of these women have underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN-2)/CIN-3. Recent reports have demonstrated that the presence of either HPV type 16 (HPV-16) or HPV-18 confers an elevated risk for CIN-2/CIN-3. The current study was designed to determine the prevalence of HPV-16 and HPV-18 in ASC-US Pap smears and to determine whether further typing would enhance the risk stratification of patients for CIN-2/CIN-3."

CD008054,0,15682286,0,The cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus screening for cervical cancer. A review of recent modelling studies.,"We compared findings from recent studies modelling the cost-effectiveness of screening for cervical cancer using human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and alternative strategies. Data were standardized to facilitate comparison of costs per life year or costs per QALY gained in six studies. Absolute changes in costs, life years and QALYs for each strategy were normalized to a comparison with no screening. Costs were standardized to US$ in 2000 values. Most models assume screening starts at age 18 or 20 years. Assumed prevalence of HPV ranges from 10% for those aged 18 years to 20% for those aged 20-25 years and drops substantially after age 30. All except one model assume sensitivity to LSIL of 83% or higher. Two models distinguish the increasing specificity of HPV testing in older age groups (up to 95% for LSIL in women aged 55 years or older). All the models include consultation costs as well as screening and treatment costs, but costs for follow-up diagnosis and treatment vary considerably. Two models also include patient time costs. Despite these differences all strategies involving HPV testing have cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) ratios in the range of USD 12,400-16,600. Costs per life year vary more widely, the highest being USD 19,246 (annual screening with liquid cytology and HPV). However, excluding strategies using liquid cytology, the highest costs per life year for a strategy including HPV testing are under USD 14,000 (simultaneous conventional cytology and HPV every two years). The cost per life year for HPV testing alone triennially is lower than for Pap smear testing alone biennially. Costs per QALY are generally lower than costs per life year (given the reported modelling assumptions and settings). Even with inclusion of patient costs, no strategies involving HPV testing cost more than USD 16,600 per QALY. Adoption of the ACOG guidelines to include HPV testing with cytology as a screening option for women aged 30 years or older therefore appears to be cost-effective."
CD008054,0,10487620,0,Genetic alterations on chromosome 17p associated with response to radiotherapy in bulky cervical cancer.,"Chromosome 17 alterations are found in more cancers than those of any other chromosome, and frequently involve the p53 gene on 17p13. The aim of this study was to identify the correlations between the presence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MI) on chromosome 17p13 in patients with cervical cancer and the patients' response to radiotherapy. A total of 50 patients were treated with definitive radiotherapy. We performed biopsies and took specimens from the tumour and venous blood of all patients. Tumour and normal DNAs were analysed by polymerase chain reaction for genetic losses and instability at three polymorphic microsatellite loci mapped to 17p13. Nineteen of the 50 tumours (38%) displayed a genetic alteration (GA) on 17p13, 16 (32%) were found to have LOH, and three (6%) showed MI. The sizes of the tumours of the GA-positive patients were significantly greater than those of the GA-negative patients (P = 0.009). The mean tumour diameter of all patients was 6 +/- 2.4 cm. We divided the patients into those with tumours smaller than 6 cm in diameter (n = 26) and those with tumours equal to or greater than 6 cm in diameter (n = 24). The former group survived significantly longer compared to the latter group (P = 0.0002). Among the patients with < 6 cm tumours, all six GA-positive patients are alive with no evidence of disease (NED), whereas of the 20 GA-negative patients, 18 have NED and two are alive with disease (AWD) or suffered cancer-caused death (CD). Thus, there was no correlation between GA and radiotherapy response in the tumours smaller than 6 cm. However, among the patients with > or = 6 cm tumours, two of the GA-positive patients have NED and 11 are AWD/CD, whereas seven of the GA-negative patients have NED and four are AWD/CD. Among the patients with > or = 6 cm tumours, the response to radiotherapy of the GA-positive patients were significantly poorer than those of the GA-negative patients (P = 0.02). In addition, the GA-negative patients survived significantly longer compared to the GA-positive patients (P = 0.026). The results of this study suggest that GA increases with tumour growth. Improved success in the management of bulky cervical cancer requires a better understanding of its biological behaviour."
CD008054,0,12421445,0,Archival cervical smears: a versatile resource for molecular investigations.,"Archival cervical smears: a versatile resource for molecular investigations Archival cervical smears represent a huge resource of pathological specimens. This, together with long clinical follow-up data, makes archival smears the most valuable resource for cervical cancer research. Despite this huge potential, only a few molecular investigations have been carried out based on archival smears. It has been shown that archival smears can be used for amplification of genomic sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, it is unknown whether PCR can be applied to minute dyskaryotic cells microdissected from archival cervical smears and whether these archival materials are suitable for reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). To address these issues, we prepared DNA and RNA samples from dyskaryotic cells microdissected from archival cervical smears with a storage time of 11 years and systematically tested the extent that these materials can be used for PCR-based molecular investigations at both DNA and RNA levels. Our results showed that a crude DNA preparation simply by proteinase K digestion was suitable for PCR amplification of genomic sequences. By targeting the amplified genomic sequence to 250 bp or less, most if not all archival smears could be used for PCR and are therefore suitable for screening gene mutations and loss of heterozygosity, human papillomavirus typing, etc. Purified DNA samples from microdissected dyskaryotic cells were adequate for restriction enzyme digestion and could be used for a PCR-based clonality analysis of the androgen receptor gene. Finally, RNA samples extracted from dyskaryotic cells microdissected from archival smears were adequate for RT-PCR as long as a gene-specific primer was used for the RT reaction and the target sequence was restricted to 150 bp or less. In summary, our results demonstrated that archival cervical smears are suitable for a range of molecular investigations at both DNA and RNA levels. The potential gain of knowledge on cervical cancer by the molecular study of archival smears is immense."

CD008054,0,20841605,0,Long-term absolute risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse following human papillomavirus infection: role of persistence.,Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cancer. It has been suggested that information about high-risk HPV type-specific infection might make cervical cancer screening more effective. Persistent HPV infection could also be a useful screening marker. We estimated the long-term risk of high-grade CIN after one-time detection of high-risk HPV DNA and after persistent infection with individual high-risk HPV types.
CD008054,0,17223540,1,HPV triage for low grade (L-SIL) cytology is appropriate for women over 35 in mass cervical cancer screening using liquid based cytology.,"In the experimental arm of a randomised trial, women were tested both for liquid-based cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA and referred for colposcopy if cytology was ASCUS (atypical cells of undetermined significance) or more severe. We considered those with ASCUS (757) or LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions) (485) and a valid HPV test who received colposcopy. We computed sensitivity, specificity and ROC curves with different values of relative light units (RLU, that are related to viral load) as cut off, using cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe (CIN2+) at blind histology review as the endpoint. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was significantly less among women aged 25-34 years than in those older, both considering ASCUS/AGUS (atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance) (p=0.0355) and LSIL (p=0.0009). At age 35-60 the curves for ASCUS and LSIL were similar, while at age 25-34 the area under the curve for LSIL was significantly less than for ASCUS (p=0.0084). With LSIL cytology, specificity of Hybrid Capture 2 with 2 RLU cut-off was 35.0% (95%CI 28.4-42.1) at age 25-34 and 64.5% (95%CI 58.3-70.3) at age 35-60. In conclusion, triaging by HPV testing performed better in women aged over 35 years than those younger. For older women, HPV triaging should also be considered for managing those with LSIL cytology."

CD008054,0,12958220,0,Comparison between prototype hybrid capture 3 and hybrid capture 2 human papillomavirus DNA assays for detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer.,"We compared the performance of a prototype version of the Hybrid Capture 3 (HC3) human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA assay to the current generation Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) assay, both of which target 13 oncogenic HPV types, for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and cancer (CIN3+) with cervicovaginal lavage specimens collected at enrollment into a 10-year cohort study at Kaiser Permanente (Portland, Oreg.). HC3 results for a risk-stratified sample (n = 4,364) were compared to HC2 results for the entire cohort (n = 20,810) with receiver operating characteristics curves, and the optimal cut points for both tests (relative light units [RLU]/positive control [PC]) for the detection of CIN3+ were determined. Specimens were also tested for HPV16 and HPV18 with separate HC3 type-specific probes. The optimal cut point for detecting CIN3+ was 1.0 RLU/PC for HC2, as previously shown, and was 0.6 RLU/PC for HC3. At the optimal cut points, HC3 and HC2 had similar screening performance characteristics for CIN3+ diagnosed at the enrollment visit. In analyses that included cases CIN3+ at enrollment and those diagnosed during early follow-up, HC3 had nonsignificantly higher sensitivity and equal specificity for the detection of CIN3+ compared to HC2; this increase in sensitivity was primarily the result of increased detection of CIN3+ in women who were 30 years of age or older and were cytologically negative (P = 0.006). We also compared the performance of the hybrid capture tests to MY09/11 L1 consensus primer PCR results (n = 1,247). HC3 was less likely than HC2 to test positive for specimens that tested positive by PCR for any untargeted types (P < 0.001). HC3 was less likely than HC2 to test positive for untargeted PCR-detected single infections with HPV53 (P = 0.001) and HPV66 (P = 0.01). There was good agreement between test positivity by PCR and by single type-specific HC3 probes for HPV16 (kappa = 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.71 to 0.82) and for HPV18 (kappa = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.68 to 0.79). In conclusion, we suggest that HC3 (>/=0.6 RLU/PC) may be slightly more sensitive than and equally specific test as HC2 (>/=1.0 RLU/PC) for the detection of CIN3+ over the duration of typical screening intervals."

CD008054,0,8895541,0,A prospective study on the risk of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia among healthy subjects with serum antibodies to HPV compared with HPV DNA in cervical smears.,"To estimate the risk of developing cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) among women exposed to human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16, we performed a prospective study in a population-based cohort of more than 15,000 women followed for 34.9 months. Seventy-four women developed CIN during follow-up and were matched for age, time of sampling and area of residence with 148 women who remained CIN-free during follow-up. The blood samples taken at enrollment were tested for serum antibodies to HPV types 16, 18 and 33 capsids. Cervical smears or biopsies were analyzed for the presence of HPV DNA by nested PCR using HPV general primers and by HPV 16- and 18-type-specific PCR HPV serology and HPV-PCR were in good agreement, particularly when the blood sample and the Pap smear were taken less than 6 months apart. HPV DNA was found in 88% of cases and 4% of controls, whereas HPV 16 DNA was present in 44% of cases and in 1 of 142 controls. HPV-16-seropositive women had a 3-fold increased risk of developing CIN. The risk was highest among women younger than 35 years of age, of whom an estimated 3.4% of HPV-16-seropositive and 0.5% of seronegative women developed CIN. Since the risk associated with HPV-16 seropositivity (a measure of past or present infection) was 35-fold lower than that of HPV DNA (present infection), most infections appear to be eliminated before CIN develops. In conclusion, HPV 16 infection does confer an excess risk of CIN development, and HPV DNA detection has a high predictive value for the presence of high-grade CIN."

CD008054,0,11563869,0,Management of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion by human papillomavirus testing.,"Cervical cytological terminology varies from country to country. In the USA, the Pap smear is reported using the Bethesda system. The abnormal morphological changes described by this system include two very problematic categories: atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS). The management of ASCUS, which is similar to the British system 'borderline' smear, has been most problematic because the majority of women with this Pap result are normal, although approximately 5-11% have high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and 1 per 1000 has cervical cancer. Because AGUS is far less common and a significantly greater risk for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ and cancer, its management is far less controversial, but it is problematic because of clinical confusion with the ASCUS terminology. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia is almost entirely related to human papillomavirus. Documentation that certain high-risk types of human papillomavirus are necessary in the aetiology of cervical cancer has led to investigations into the management of these equivocal and low-grade Pap smear abnormalities by testing for these human papillomavirus types."
CD008054,0,8869098,0,Human papilloma virus has no prognostic significance in cervical carcinoma.,"The prognostic significance of the detection of HPV (human papilloma virus) DNA in cervical carcinoma was evaluated in 223 cases treated from January 1988 to November 1989. HPV DNA was detected by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on fresh tumour specimens obtained before therapy was started. HPV DNA of any type was detected in 93.3% of all tumours, HPV16 was the predominant type and was detected in 69% of cases. HPV18 was more frequent in adeno- and adenosquamous carcinoma than in squamous cell carcinoma and occurred more often in poorly differentiated tumours than in more highly differentiated tumours. Patients with HPV negative tumours were on average older than patients with tumours containing HPV. Neither presence of HPV DNA nor HPV type had prognostic significance. In 63 women with early stage tumours submitted to surgery, no difference was found in the frequency of lymph node metastasis, vessel invasion or prognosis related to HPV type. We conclude that neither the presence nor the type of HPV DNA had any prognostic significance in cervical carcinoma."

However, it is different from other benign nasal and paranasal tumors, in histological morphology, and in higher probabilities of recurrence, complication with malignant tumor, and malignant alteration. In this study, we examined clinically and pathologically 30 patients with nasal and paranasal sinus papilloma who underwent operations in our department between 1975 and 1994. The tumor occurred in the opening of the maxillary sinus in 19 patients and in the nasal septum in 7 patients. Destruction of bone was observed in 12 patients. Pathological examination revealed inverted papilloma in 17 patients, exophytic papilloma in 13 patients, and atypia in 4 patients. Recurrence was observed in 9 patients, and malignant alteration was observed in 5 patients. Using paraffin sections, aneuploidy was assessed by flow cytometric DNA ploidy. Diploid in 25 cases (83.3%) and aneuploid in 5 cases (16.7%) were observed. Risk factors of malignant alteration in nasal and paranasal papilloma are considered to be 1) developmental morphology, 2) destruction of bones, 3) atypia in pathology, 4) recurrence before progression to malignancy, and 5) the presence of aneuploidy. The 5 patients in whom malignant alteration was observed each showed 4 of the 5 risk factors, suggesting that malignant alteration is most likely to occur in nasal and paranasal papilloma that show 4 or 5 risk factors. The period up to malignant alteration varies; in one patient, it was more than 10 years. Therefore, follow-up observation over a long period is required."

Our aim was to evaluate the potential value of this fast and sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method for intra-operative detection of chromosomal aberrations as a surrogate marker for incomplete tumor resection. Biopsies of the primary tumors and adjacent macroscopically nonmalignant mucosa 1 and 2 cm away from the tumor margins were collected from 20 patients. DNA were isolated, and 11 microsatellite markers at loci 3q25.31 approximately 3q28 were amplified by PCR. Allelic losses or gains were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. Imbalanced alleles were common in the samples evaluated. In the median gains of the informative loci were detected in 67% of the primary tumors, 22% of the samples taken at 1 cm and 15% of the samples taken at 2 cm distance. We observed gains of 3q at least in one microsatellite in all primary tumors, in 15 (1 cm) and 12 (2 cm) nonmalignant mucosa samples. Gain of genetic material is frequent in tumor-surrounding mucosa. Detection of small chromosomal aberrations is possible using the PCR-based, highly sensitive, and fast-to-perform fragment analysis technique.

CD008054,0,8143613,0,Mutagenesis after cancer therapy.,"A subset of Hodgkin's disease (HD) and breast cancer patients have been reported to have elevated hprt mutant frequencies in peripheral blood lymphocytes after cessation of therapy. A subset of these patients are also known to develop second therapy-related malignancies. Therefore, it is clearly important to determine if these elevations in mutant frequency represent true, persistently elevated mutation frequencies. As a follow-up to our study of patients previously treated for HD, we recruited for a prospective study six previously treated HD patients and five patients who had been treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. These individuals were studied several times over a 6-7 months. The results confirmed that a subset of patients have persistently high mutant frequencies when compared to 71 previously studied controls. The study was designed to determine if the elevated mutant frequencies of treated patients represented independent mutations or resulted from the in vivo expansion of single mutant cells. We used the polymerase chain reaction to examine DNA single strand conformation polymorphisms at the T-cell receptor-gamma locus of individual mutant clones. This analysis showed that 20.1% of the mutants from Hodgkin's disease patients and 17.5% of the mutants from squamous cell carcinoma patients were siblings. The sibling mutants generally did not persist over time. However, one patient had one mutant clone that persisted, but slowly decreased in prevalence over a 7 month sampling period. The data demonstrate that treatments for cancer result in persistently elevated mutation frequencies at the hprt locus in some, but not all, patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The interobserver agreement (reliability) of the PAPNET reviewers was computed, and their readings were compared with three standards: the consensus diagnosis of five pathologists who used light microscopy, the detection of cancer-associated human papillomavirus DNA by Southern analysis, and the correlation with diagnoses of biopsy specimens obtained during passive follow-up. The PAPNET reviewers classified 18 to 65% of cases as normal, 25 to 42% as equivocal, and 10 to 55% as abnormal. Unanimous interobserver agreement was achieved in only 24 (13%) cases. Four of the five PAPNET reviewers agreed moderately well with the results of the pathology reference panel. In four of the five PAPNET reviews, classification of cases as abnormal was strongly correlated with the detection of cancer-associated types of human papillomavirus. Consensus PAPNET results of abnormal were predictive of abnormal histologic findings at follow-up. Theoretically, if colposcopy had been performed on all of the women with equivocal or abnormal PAPNET results (based on the consensus of the panel), as much as 95% of biopsy-confirmed lesions could have been detected, but 79% of women would have been referred. Restriction of colposcopy referral to women with definitely abnormal PAPNET readings would have reduced referrals to 31%, but the sensitivity of the triage would have dropped to 51% of biopsy-confirmed lesions."

EBV was detected by PCR in 11 biopsies, but in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry, did not confirm this finding. Aberrant p53 expression was observed in approximately half of the tumours. These results support the involvement of both aberrant p53 expression and HPV in the aetiology of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck."
CD008054,0,17592428,0,Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the trachea.,"Lymphoepithelioma is a lymphocyte-rich, poorly differentiated and non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx. Tumors arising outside the nasopharynx are rare and are designated as lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas (LELCs). This is the third reported case of LELC of the trachea. A 27-year-old woman was referred to our hospital on suspicion of bronchial asthma on August 2000. A polypoid tumor of the cervical trachea was recognized on neck X-ray, neck computed tomography (CT) scan, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The protruding tumor was resected endoscopically by an electrosurgical snare. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations demonstrated large irregular polygonal cells extending in an islet or trabecular pattern among lymphoid stroma. These polygonal cells showed non-keratinization, atypia and prominent nucleoli. In situ hybridization showed these cells were infected with the Epstein-Barr (EB) virus. The infiltrating lymphocytes consisted of both T-and B-lymphocytes with no atypia. Thus the tumor was diagnosed as LELC. Blood examination revealed a past EB viral infection. Sphenoid resection of the tracheal cartilaginous portion was performed for residual tumor. We gave 50 Gy postoperative radiation, and she has been disease free in the 6-year follow-up period."
CD008054,0,15369795,0,Human papilloma virus type 16 infection and the early onset of cervical cancer.,"Human papilloma viruses (HPV), particularly type 16, have been associated with cervical cancer. It has been noted that the average onset of cervical cancer is occurring in younger women coupled with a higher prevalence of cervical HPV infection. However, the correlation between HPV 16 infection and the early onset of cervical cancer is still unclear. We hypothesize that HPV infection is an indicator of early onset of cervical cancer. To test this hypothesis, cervical smears from 197 women were evaluated by the polymerase chain reaction for HPV 16. These data revealed that the HPV 16-positive women were significantly younger than the HPV 16-negative women. Moreover, the average age of HPV 16-positive women with CIN 3 or invasive cancer was significantly younger compared with the other groups. These data clearly suggest that HPV 16 infection is a significant risk factor for the progression for cervical cancer in a young population of women."

CD008054,0,15345076,0,Cancer of the Uterine Cervix.,"HEALTH ISSUE: Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases of women; it is diagnosed in almost half a million women every year and half as many die from it annually. In Canada and other industrialized countries, its incidence has decreased due to cytology screening. However, invasive cases still occur, particularly among immigrant groups and native Canadian women. Although incidence of squamous cell carcinomas has decreased, the proportion of adenocarcinomas has increased because Pap cytology is ineffective to detect these lesions. KEY FINDINGS: In Canada, cervical cancer will cause an estimated 11,000 person-years of life lost. In most Canadian provinces, early detection is dependent on opportunistic screening. Primary prevention can be achieved through health education (sexual behavior modification) and vaccination to prevent infection from Human Papillomavirus (HPV). The initial results from vaccination trials are encouraging but wide scale use is more than a decade away. DATA GAPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Most cases of cervical cancer occur because the Pap smear was either false negative, was not done or not done often enough. Appropriate recommendations and guidelines exist on implementation of cytology-based programs. However, most Canadian women do not have access to organized screening. Further research is needed to 1) evaluate automated cytology systems; 2) define appropriate management of precursor lesions and 3) deliver definitive evidence of HPV testing efficacy in long-term follow-up studies with invasive cancer as an outcome and 4) provide Canadian data to justify augmenting or modifying current programs to use HPV testing in secondary triage of equivocal Pap smears."
CD008054,0,7827152,0,Epidemiology of AIDS-related malignancies.,"HIV infection is known to increase the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Kaposi's sarcoma preferentially affects homosexual men and risk varies by geographic area, suggesting there is an environmental cofactor for Kaposi's sarcoma in addition to HIV. Despite intensive investigation, the responsible cofactor has not been conclusively identified. HIV-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma affects all HIV transmission groups, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma risk increases with duration of HIV infection and age. Epstein-Barr virus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this tumor, but the precise mechanisms have not been worked out. Cervical cancer and anal cancer have a less certain association with HIV infection and immunodeficiency, although epithelial dysplasia at these sites does seem to be HIV-related. Children with HIV infection are additionally affected by increased incidence of leiomyosarcoma and benign leiomyoma, whereas adults with HIV infection do not seem particularly susceptible to this tumor, perhaps because of hormonal or growth-promoting factors. Apart from these specific disease associations, HIV infection and related immunodeficiency do not result in a generalized tumor diathesis.

CD008054,0,15822686,0,[Prevalence of human papillomavirus infection in Slovenian women with repeated Pap II smears].,"In the detection of precancerous lesions the cervical Papanicolaou smear screening is used in Slovenia and worldwide. Management of patients with repeat abnormal smears (Pap II) represents a great and complex clinical and public health problem. Repeated cytologic examinations are routine procedure in many countries, also in Slovenia, although the sensitivity of Pap smear testing in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II and III is relatively low. In cases of abnormal squamous cells and mildly dyskaryotic cells the presence of infections with high-risk HPV genotypes is being increasingly used as a complementary method to Pap smear testing. In the study we enrolled 148 cervical samples of women who within two years had three subsequent Pap II smears (abnormal squamous cells or mildly dyskaryotic cells). The prevalence of HPV infections was determined using three molecular tests: Hybrid Capture 2 (hc2) test and two variants of polymerase chain reaction (PCR-PGMY11/PGMY09 and PCR-CPI/CPIIG). HPV infection was detected in 25.7% of women. In women aged < or = 30 years a statistically significant higher prevalence of HPV infections was found (37.8%) than in women aged > 30 years (20.4%). Our findings show that repeat Pap smear as the method of follow-up and detection of precancerous lesions of the observed population do not provide relevant results due to low prevalence of HPV infections in Slovenia, which indirectly indicates low sensitivity and specificity of Pap smear testing. In the detection of HPV infections, molecular methods are thus sensitive screening tests to be used complementary to cytologic tests in women with abnormal squamous cells and mildly dyskaryotic cells."

CD008054,0,20135209,0,Women's knowledge of HPV and their perceptions of physician educational efforts regarding HPV and cervical cancer.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) was one of the most common sexually transmitted infections in women of child-bearing age in the US. It was estimated that nearly three out of every four American women between the ages of 15 and 49 would be infected with genital HPV over the course of their lifetime. Human papillomavirus was present in almost 100% of cervical cancers. Despite this growing epidemic, there was little knowledge and awareness of HPV among the general public. HPV was most often detected in abnormal Pap test results. However, women undergoing Pap tests lacked basic knowledge about HPV testing, abnormal results, and follow-up procedures. The purpose of this study was to determine women's knowledge of HPV and their perceptions of the education they received from their physician regarding the reason for a Pap test, explanation of Pap test results, and how effectively the physician explained associations between HPV and cell abnormalities, cervical cancer, risk factors, and preventive measures. A survey containing 33 questions was completed by 109 primarily professional women. Based on the data collected in this study it seems that physicians were not routinely providing HPV information to their female patients. Women reported their physicians were not educating them on testing for HPV and cervical cancer, risk factors associated with contracting HPV, and preventive measures associated with HPV. Younger physicians were more likely to discuss these topics with women than older physicians. Single women also reported more discussion with their physician on these topics than married women."

Improved cost effectiveness by selective colposcopy.,"Since up to 45% of patients with atypical Papanicolaou smears have been shown to have significant pathology, women with persistent atypia are usually referred for colposcopy. This study evaluated the use of a new adjunctive screening test, speculoscopy, in selecting women with atypical Papanicolaou smears who would most benefit from referral for colposcopy. Both screening and referral patients were evaluated with the Papanicolaou smear, speculoscopy and colposcopy at 10 study centers. Biopsies were obtained from most women with positive colposcopy. The results in patients with atypical smears were used to perform a cost-benefit analysis of each of three management protocols. Using the results of speculoscopy to select women with atypical Papanicolaou smears for colposcopy provided a cost-effective alternative to performing colposcopy either on all women or on those with persistent atypia following treatment. Even when all women undergo speculoscopy at the time of screening, this protocol provides a cost savings of up to 24% and no significant loss of diagnostic accuracy. These data suggest that speculoscopy performed at the time of initial screening can accurately select women with atypical Papanicolaou smears who require colposcopy for diagnostic biopsy in a cost-effective manner."

CD008054,0,18642468,0,Cervical cancer screening following prophylactic human papillomavirus vaccination.,The recognition that infection with certain human papillomavirus (HPV) types is a necessary cause of cervical cancer has opened new fronts for the prevention of this disease. Primary prevention is now possible via immunization with highly efficacious HPV vaccines and secondary prevention has gained impetus with the advent of sensitive HPV DNA testing to improve traditional Pap cytology screening programs. Although universal vaccination of teenagers and young women is a desirable policy cost remains a key obstacle. To achieve cost-effective reductions in the burden of cervical cancer prevention initiatives must consider screening and immunization as integrated and organized approaches that take advantage of HPV testing as primary screening test followed by triage with Pap cytology. This strategy has the added benefit of providing epidemiological surveillance of vaccinated populations.

Results were compared and subsequently related to histological grading, lymph node status, pT category, and pathological stage. DNA content was non-diploid in 9 cases (30%). Mean AgNOR counts per tumor ranged from 2.52 to 8.76. PCNA and Ki-67 expressions were similar in 10 cases (33%). In the remaining cases, PCNA-positive cells usually outnumbered Ki-67-positive cells. No significant correlation was found among DNA index, PCNA and Ki-67 expressions, and AgNOR counts. Although there was a positive trend when Ki-67 was compared with histological grading, findings were not statistically significant. In contrast, a significant correlation was found between DNA index and lymph node status (P = 0.035), with a higher incidence of neck node metastases in non-diploid tumors. These data suggest that tumor ploidy can be correlated with lymph node spread in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and might be used as an additional prognostic factor when planning treatment."
CD008054,0,12063555,0,Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (roscovitine) suppresses growth and induces apoptosis by regulating Bcl-x in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells.,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) play essential roles in the intracellular controls of the cell cycles. Roscovitine, [2-(R)-(1-ethyl-2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-isopropylpurine], is a potent and selective inhibitor of the Cdk2 and Cdc2. We investigated whether this compound was effective against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. Roscovitine was found to inhibit the growth of all 11 HNSCC cell lines in time- and dose-dependent manner and to diminish the Cdk2 and Cdc2 activities. An induction of apoptosis was observed in all cells, as judged by the cell morphology, along with the appearance of cells with sub-G1 DNA contents, DNA fragmentations, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. In four HNSCC cell lines, apoptosis was induced without antecedent marked cell cycle arrest, and in the other seven cell lines, cell cycle arrest preceded cell death. We also found up-regulation of Bcl-xS in the former cell lines, and in the latter cell lines, the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were induced simultaneously. These results suggest that roscovitine exerts antitumor activities in HNSCC and is associated with induction of Bcl-xS. Roscovitine can be considered to provide a new chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic strategy for the clinical management of HNSCC."

In thyroid cancer, mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been largely confined to the more aggressive anaplastic forms. We studied point mutations in the p53 gene in 22 patients exposed in childhood to radiation in the head and neck area who later developed papillary thyroid cancers (RITC). Eighteen thyroid cancer patients without exposure to radiation, selected to match by gender and age the RITC group, were used as the control group. After histological identification, DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded specimens. Exons 5-8 of p53 were PCR amplified and screened for mutations by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and cycle sequencing. Four of 22 RITC patients (18%) showed missense point mutations. No missense mutations were found in the cancer control group. The missense mutations in the RITC group occurred at codon 208 in 2 patients, codon 177 in 1, and codon 217 in 1. The mutations were transitions from G to A and C to T. All patients with missense mutations were male and had lymph node involvement. Three of the 4 patients with p53 missense mutations had invasion of the cancer beyond the thyroid capsule compared to 2 of the 17 remaining RITC patients. None of the patients with p53 mutations had distant metastases or recurrence of the tumor. These results suggest that p53 gene point mutations may play a pathogenetic role in some radiation-induced, well differentiated thyroid cancers and in their local spread."

CD008054,0,19684447,0,Integrating human papillomavirus vaccination in cervical cancer control programmes.,"Screening with Pap cytology has substantially reduced cervical cancer morbidity and mortality during the last 50 years in high-income countries. Unfortunately, in resource-poor countries, Pap screening has either not been effectively implemented or has failed to reduce cervical cancer rates. Cervical cancer in these countries thus remains a major public health problem. Infection with certain human papillomavirus (HPV) types is now recognized as a necessary cause of this disease and has led to new preventive strategies for cervical cancer. Testing for HPV DNA of oncogenic types is gaining increasing interest and application in cervical cancer screening. It has much greater sensitivity and only slightly lower specificity than Pap cytology. Molecular-based screening will be of particular clinical value in the post-vaccine era in which cervical disease will be a rare event and may escape cytology-based detection. As a primary screening test followed by Pap triage of HPV-positive cases, HPV testing has the potential to improve the overall quality of screening programmes, thus allowing for increased testing intervals, which would lower program costs with acceptable safety. Prophylactic vaccines against the 2 leading oncogenic HPV types (16 and 18) have been recently licensed. In large clinical trials, they have shown excellent safety and nearly 100% efficacy in preventing persistent infections and the cervical pre-cancers due to vaccine HPV types 16 and 18. Combining modern screening techniques and universal prophylactic HPV vaccination is likely to produce the most advanced and cost-effective preventive strategy to fight cervical cancer worldwide."

CD008054,0,9887239,0,Cervicography and HPV DNA testing as triage criteria for patients with abnormal pap smear.,"Cervicography and HPV DNA testing have been proposed as intermediate triage techniques for the management of patients with Pap smear showing minor-grade atypia. The aims of the present study of 221 patients with positive Pap smear (ages 16-65) were (1) to evaluate the association of cervicography and HPV DNA test with the probability of biopsy and final histology diagnosis of CIN2 or worse, (2) to identify the combinations of results on cervicography and HPV DNA test associated with the absence of such lesions, and (3) to estimate the cost of a potential triage protocol for patients with HPV-CIN1 smear. The probability of biopsy showed a univariate association with the severity of the smear result and the cervicography classification but not the HPV DNA test. In the multivariate analysis, only the cervicography result was a significant predictor of biopsy. The final histology diagnosis showed a univariate association with each of the three tests and a multivariate association with the degree of cytology positivity and the cervicography result. Among patients with HPV-CIN1 smears, only a negative cervicography (with any HPV DNA test result) was always associated with the absence of severe histologic lesions. This pattern accounted only for 7% of such patients. The additional costs of a potential triage protocol based on cervicography were estimated to exceed the savings resulting from the reduced colposcopy rate."

Moreover in these field a non negligible portion of lesions progress to High-Grade Lesion (H-SIL). With the aim of comparing the data, we examined samples observed in our Ambulatories with 6-12 months follow-up. We observed retrospectively 11.197 Pap test from January 1995 to June 1997, mostly first visits. All received a Pap test, colposcopy and gynaecological examination. Biopsy and histological standard examinations were performed when necessary. Alterations classified as mild epithelial abnormalities, of both ASCUS and L-SIL categories, were observed in 146 cases: 78 ASCUS and 68 L-SIL. Of these 48 were CIN 1/mild dysplasia (25 HPV associated) and 20 were HPV lesions, according to BS. All the cases with persistent ASCUS and L-SIL underwent a second control. In these 45 cases we observed 2 new cases of H-SIL and one of L-SIL; so 82.3% and 30.7% of ASCUS and L-SIL regressed to negatives. In the stable group 11.8% and 60.4% were ASCUS and L-SIL. Moreover 5.9% of ASCUS and 4.8% of L-SIL progressed to H-SIL. No cases of invasive cancer were observed. Our data show that ASCUS and L-SIL diagnosis can identify 6% and 4.8% of H-SIL respectively. In addition 17-18% of ASCUS were stable or progressed. These two categories, as already demonstrated in other studies, are mostly at risk."

CD008054,0,11266518,0,HPV DNA testing of the residual sample of liquid-based Pap test: utility as a quality assurance monitor.,"HPV DNA testing of the residual sample volume of liquid-based Pap tests has been recommended as a way to determine the appropriate follow-up for women who have equivocal results in routine clinical screening. A major aspect of quality assurance in the cytopathology laboratory consists of correlation of smear interpretation with biopsy or conization results as mandated by CLIA '88. However, the use of histology as the gold standard suffers from similar problems of subjectivity and sampling as the Pap smear. In this study we explore the potential use of HPV DNA testing of the residual volume from the ThinPrep Pap Test (Cytyc Corporation, Boxborough, Massachusetts) as a substitute gold standard in quality assurance monitoring of a cervical cytology screening program. The residual samples from 397 ThinPrep Pap cases were retrospectively analyzed for high-risk HPV DNA using the Hybrid Capture II technique. Sensitivity (71.8%), specificity (86.5%), predictive value of positive (77.1%) and negative (82.9%) ThinPrep Pap interpretations were calculated on the basis of HPV DNA results for 266 cases classed as either squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) or negative. Overall, there was agreement between the two tests in 80.8% of cases (Cohen's kappa =.59). The percentage of HPV DNA-positive cases interpreted as atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASCUS) was 43.7%, and the percentage of negative cases was 17.1%. We believe that this approach is an objective adjunct to the traditional quality assurance protocol, with the added benefit that it includes cases interpreted as negative, as well as abnormal cases that do not come to biopsy."

We demonstrated previously that overexpression of the wild-type p53 gene in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cell lines via adenovirus-mediated gene transfer suppressed growth both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we characterize the mechanism of the growth suppression by the exogenous p53 gene as a consequence of programmed cell death (apoptosis). One of the cell lines used in this study, Tu-138, harbors a mutated p53 gene, whereas the other cell line, MDA 686LN, possesses a wild-type p53 gene. DNA fragmentation was detected by electrophoresis in both cell lines after infection with the wild-type p53 adenovirus, Ad5CMV-p53. With the use of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling method, 4.4% of the remaining viable Tu-138 cell population was identified as apoptotic as early as 15 h after inoculation with Ad5CMV-p53. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased to 31% at 22 h. In contrast, only 10% of the viable MDA 686LN cells (wt-p53) had undergone apoptosis 30 h after Ad5CMV-p53 infection, although the percentage of apoptotic cells rapidly increased to 60% at 48 h after infection. For in vivo analysis of apoptosis, nude mice in which squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cell lines had been implanted s.c. had exogenous wt-p53 transiently introduced to the tumor cells via Ad5CMV-p53 2 days later. In situ end labeling clearly illustrated apoptosis in the tumor cells. These results suggest that wt-p53 plays an important role in the induction of apoptosis in human head and neck cancer cell lines and that selective induction of apoptosis in cancer cells can be further explored as a strategy for cancer gene therapy."

It is expected that with good coverage of the vaccine, 70% of cervical cancers will be prevented, as will a proportion of other HPV-related anogenital diseases. Issues that will require careful consideration will include: whether males and females should be vaccinated; the durability of the immune response; the proportion of attributable disease to the HPV types targetted by the vaccines; and accessibility and cost of the vaccine.

CD008054,0,12618194,0,The p53 network in head and neck cancer.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and, despite advances in treatment, still represents a clinical challenge. Inactivation of one or more components of the p53 network is an extremely common event in human neoplasia. In HNSCC, disabling of p53 occurs in a high proportion of cases by mutation in the p53 gene, but other mechanisms of inactivation, such as the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and molecular abnormalities in other components of the pathway, are also recognised. The frequent changes occurring in the p53 pathway in HNSCC imply that molecular genetic and immunocytochemical analysis of this critical tumour suppressor network may be of diagnostic and prognostic utility in the clinical management of HNSCC. Further, these changes also provide targets for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to this increasingly common cancer, in which clinical cure for advanced disease remains an elusive goal."

Towards this end, three classes of markers were investigated: cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs; Î±-SMA positivity) as a representative of the tumor microenvironment, maspin (mammary serine protease inhibitor) as a tumor marker likely to be modulated by factors within the tumor microenvironment, and DNA content and Ki-67 labeling index as inbuilt tumor markers in 128 cases of MTSCC using immunohistochemistry and image cytometry. Of these markers, only CAF density was independently and relatively strongly associated with elevated mortality from MTSCC. The hazard ratio in the CAF-rich type of tumor microenvironment was 4.85 (95% CI 1.41-16.6, versus the CAF-poor) when adjusted by proportional hazards modeling for the center where the patient was managed, gender, tumor stage, presence of neck metastasis and age at diagnosis. CAF density was unrelated to non-MTSSC mortality. Given the strong association between increased CAF density and higher mortality in MTSCC, routine assessment of CAF density for disease course prognosis and inclusion as an integral part of treatment protocols are recommended."

This region is thought to be involved in transformational, tumorigenic events. No mRNAs of the E6 region were detectable using the most sensitive PCR-mediated procedure currently available. Since it was previously shown that in cytological abnormal cervical scrapings about one-half of the samples positive for HPV 16 DNA express mRNAs of the E6 region, a difference between normal and abnormal cervical scrapings, when the HPV 16 is present, exists. The observed difference between cytologically normal and abnormal, HPV-DNA-positive cervical scrapes may eventually be used as a prognostic marker for screening of women at risk for the development of cervical carcinoma. However, firm establishment of the putative correlation between tumor progression and the presence of E6 transcripts requires extensive follow-up analysis of HPV-positive patients."

This study evaluated associations between three single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL10 promoter and clearance of low- or high-risk HPV infection in a cohort of 226 largely HIV-1-infected African-American adolescent females. Among immunosuppressed individuals (HIV-1 seropositive and CD4(+) </= 500), the GCC haplotype in the IL10 promoter was associated with reduced clearance of high-risk HPV16-like [relative hazard (RH), 0.46; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.25-0.85; P = 0.01], HPV18-like (RH, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.16-0.67; P = 0.002), and any high-risk type (RH, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.20-0.68; P = 0.002) but not with low-risk HPV type (RH, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.29-1.25; P = 0.17). No associations were observed among immunocompetent individuals. The IL10 GCC haplotype has been associated with production of relatively high levels of interleukin (IL)-10, which could (a) inhibit cytokines such as IL-2, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-12 that are involved in the T(H)1-T(H)2 immunoregulation; (b) down-regulate expression of MHC class I and class II molecules; or (c) induce the transcription of early promoter of HPV, all potentially contributing to duration of HPV infection among immunosuppressed individuals. These results support the hypothesis that IL10 polymorphisms influence the clearance of infection with high-risk HPV types and warrant further studies of host genetic control of HPV pathogenesis and cervical cancer in the context of immunosuppression."

(FIGO) stages operated on according to the Wertheim technique. A parallel histological evaluation and HPV status determination were carried out on biopsies from the primary tumors and on the regional lymph nodes. A general primer mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed at first and the samples not amplified were examined by type-specific primers. All except one primary tumors contained DNA-sequences characteristic for high risk HPV-types. The lymph nodes of these HPV-positive patients proved to be also HPV-positive with a frequency of 25/30 (83%). The frequency of the HPV-positivity was higher (100%) in the group of patients with HPV-18 positive status, than in the HPV-16 positive group. Two thirds of the evaluated regional lymph nodes were HPV-positive in the HPV-16 group of patients. The same HPV-types were harboured by the primary tumors and by the regional lymph nodes both in the HPV-16 positive and HPV-18 positive groups of patients. In the HPV-16-positive group of patients metastatic lymph nodes occurred with a frequency of 3/16, while the frequency of HPV-16 positivity in the same nodes was 11/15. In the group of patients with HPV-18 positivity the difference was even greater, 1/12 v. 12/12. Early recurrences were detected in a relation of 3 to 1 in the group of patients with histologically tumor-free and metastatic-positive lymph node status. At the same time all of the lymph nodes in this group with early recurrency (4/4) contained DNA-sequences characteristic for the HPV-18 type. These findings raise the hypothesis that the HPV-specific nucleic acids detected in the lymph nodes can be taken as sensitive indicators of metastases. The follow-up results support these hypothesis as patients with HPV-18 positive lymph node status showed early recurrencies and short survival that is poor prognosis not corresponding to the early stage of cervical cancer with histologically negative lymph node status."

Using consensus primer-mediated PCR assays, HPV DNA was detected in 90% (18/20) of HSIL, 95% (40/42) of LSIL and 64% (60/94) of ASC-US cases. HPV DNA positivity was significantly associated with CIN 2/3/carcinoma (P<0.001) in women with ASC-US, but not in women with LSIL (P=0.52). Of HPV DNA-positive specimens, the eight oncogenic HPV types were detected in 83% of HSIL cases (15/18), 53% of LSIL cases (21/40), and 47% of ASC-US cases (28/60). The eight oncogenic HPV types were significantly associated with CIN 2/3/carcinoma (OR, 10.6; 95% CI, 3.98-28.10; P<0.001), whereas no significant association was observed between the non-eight oncogenic HPV types and CIN 2/3/carcinoma (OR, 2.20; 95%CI, 0.80-6.03; P=0.125). In women with ASC-US, HPV genotyping for the eight oncogenic types showed higher specificity (81 vs 46%) and positive predictive value (PPV, 44 vs 26%) in predicting CIN 2/3/carcinoma compared to HPV DNA testing. Similarly, in women with LSIL, higher specificity (69 vs 8%) and PPV (62 vs 39%) for predicting CIN 2/3/carcinoma were also observed using HPV genotyping test for the eight oncogenic types compared to HPV DNA testing. Our findings suggested that HPV genotyping for the eight oncogenic types might be useful to improve the efficacy of HPV DNA testing for predicting CIN 2/3/carcinoma in women with mildly abnormal Pap results, which may lead to personalized clinical management with improved patient compliance for follow-up."
CD008054,0,12775944,0,Atypical glandular cells: new Bethesda Terminology and Management Guidelines.,"Although Pap tests have enabled early detection of premalignant lesions, the introduction of new collecting devices has significantly improved the detection of lesions hidden in the endocervical canal, such as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). The term ""atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance"" (AGUS) was introduced at the 1988 Bethesda Conference and defined as morphologic changes in glandular cells beyond those that are suggestive of the benign reactive process, but insufficient for the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). In the new 2001 Bethesda System, the term has been eliminated and replaced with the term ""atypical glandular cells"" (AGC), with the following subclassifications: not otherwise specified (NOS), favor neoplasia, endocervical AIS, and adenocarcinoma. The risks of premalignant or malignant disease associated with the AGC favor neoplasia category are substantially higher than in the AGC NOS category (96% vs. 9-41%, respectively). Patients diagnosed with AGC NOS or AGC favor neoplasia will require colposcopy, endocervical sampling, and, for patients over 35 years of age, endometrial biopsy. If all of these tests are negative, the Pap test should be repeated in 4-6 month intervals until 4 consecutive normal tests are obtained. Positive results in one of the tests will require management according to ASCCP guidelines. The AGC favor neoplasia diagnosis also requires cervical conization and/or other testing, as the incidence of premalignant or malignant lesions in patients with this diagnosis is high. The role of HPV testing in this setting is unknown at this time."

Prior to the colposcopic procedure, patients (N=76) were randomly assigned to one of three preparatory conditions: (a) Loss-framed message, which emphasized the cost of nonadherence to screening recommendations; (b) Gain-framed message, which emphasized the benefit of adherence; and (c) Neutrally-framed message. It was hypothesized that low monitors (who are more positively biased about their health) would show a more adaptive pattern of response to loss-framed information than high monitors (who are more negatively biased about their health). The results of a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses were consistent with this prediction. Low monitoring was associated with greater knowledge retention (beta=.61, p<.05) and less canceling/rescheduling of follow-up appointments in the loss condition than in the neutral condition (beta=.82, p<.002). High monitoring, however, was associated with greater intrusive ideation when information was presented in the loss-oriented frame as compared to the neutral frame (beta=.99, p<.01). Knowledge retention and screening adherence were not affected by the framing manipulation. The differences between high versus low monitors as a function of loss or neutral frame suggest an interaction effect, wherein both the type of framing message and the individual's attentional style lead to distinctive cognitive-affective and behavioral patterns. The findings may have clinical implications for the tailoring of health messages to the individual's signature style."

In addition to cytological screening, nucleic acid testing is the mainstay of diagnosis and follow-up. The molecular tests used for the detection of HPV-DNA in cervical specimens, usually rely on consensus polymerase chain reaction assays that target L1 region of the viral genome. Diagnostic assays that monitor mRNAs from HPV oncogenic proteins, E6 and E7, have also been recently developed. This study was aimed to detect E6/E7 mRNAs from high-risk HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33 and 45 qualitatively by a commercial Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) assay (NucliSENS EasyQ HPV; bioMÃ©rieux, France) from cervical specimens. Cervical smear samples were collected from 57 women who had suspected lesions in gynecologic examination and transported by a commercial liquid-based cytology system (ThinPrep Pap Smear Method, Cytyc, USA). Nucleic acid purification was performed by an automated commercial station (NucliSENS easyMAG, bioMÃ©rieux, France) as directed by the manufacturer.

Regulatory T cells (T(regs)) might be involved in the failure of the immune system to control the development of HPV-induced cancer. We investigated frequencies, phenotype and activity of T(regs) in patients with cervical neoplasia. CIN and cervical cancer patients showed increased CD4(+)/CD25(high) T cell frequencies in peripheral blood and CD4(+) T cell fraction. These CD4(+)/CD25(high) T cells represent T(regs) as demonstrated by their low proliferation rate, low interferon (IFN)-gamma/interleukin (IL)-10 ratio, high expression of CD45RO, GITR, CTLA-4, forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) and low CD45RA expression. Moreover, in HPV16(+) cervical cancer patients, in-vitro depletion of CD25(+) T cells resulted in increased IFN-gamma T cell responses against HPV16 E6- and E7 peptides. Thus, increased frequencies of T(regs) in cervical cancer patients may indeed suppress HPV-specific immunity. Longitudinal analysis of CD4(+)/CD25(high) T cell frequencies in patients showed a modest decline 1 year after curative surgery or chemoradiation. This study demonstrates increased frequencies and suppressive activity of T(regs) in cervical cancer. These results imply that T(regs) may suppress the immune control of cervical neoplasia and furthermore that suppression of immunity by T(regs) will be another hurdle to overcome in therapeutic immunization strategies against cervical neoplasia."

Patients with advanced-stage HNSCC were treated within a randomized trial, investigating the optimal route of cisplatin administration, concurrently with radiation. Cisplatin was administered intra-arterially (IA, 150 mg/m2, with systemic rescue by sodium thiosulfate) or intravenously (IV, 100 mg/m2). In a subgroup, adducts were quantified in normal tissue and tumor. 32P-postlabeling was used to quantify intrastrand guanosine-guanosine adducts (GG-adducts) and adenosine-guanosine adducts (AG-adducts). Adduct levels were correlated with treatment outcome. Thirty-five patients were included (21 IV and 14 IA). At median follow-up of 27 months, locoregional (LR) control was 75% at 1 and 70% at 2 years. Adduct levels in tumor were 4-5-fold higher than in white blood cells (WBC) for both IA and IV treatment (p = 0.01). Adduct formation in WBC and buccal cells was higher in IV treated patients compared with IA infusion (p = 0.049 and 0.005 for GG-adducts in WBC and buccal cells, respectively). Adducts in tumors after IA infusion were not statistically different from those after IV. A strong correlation was observed between GG- and AG-adduct formation (r = 0.86, p < 0.001). Patients with higher GG adduct levels (>median) in primary tumor had significantly better disease free survival (DFS) than patients with lower (< or = median) adduct levels (p = 0.02). For overall survival (OS), a nonsignificant trend was observed, again in favor of patients with higher adduct levels (p = 0.06). In conclusion, cisplatin-DNA adduct formation in primary tumor appears to be predictive for DFS in HNSCC. No differences were observed in intratumoral adduct levels between IA and IV treatments, despite selective infusion of high-dose cisplatin with the IA procedure. However, systemic adduct levels (WBC and buccal cells) from IV patients were higher than in IA patients, consistent with less systemic exposure after IA administration."
CD008054,0,19695867,0,The challenges of organising cervical screening programmes in the 15 old member states of the European Union.,"Cervical cancer incidence and mortality can be reduced substantially by organised cytological screening at 3 to 5 year intervals, as was demonstrated in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and parts of Italy. Opportunistic screening, often proposed at yearly schedules, has also reduced the burden of cervical cancer in some, but not all, of the other old member states (belonging to the European Union since 1995) but at a cost that is several times greater. Well organised screening programmes have the potential to achieve greater participation of the target population at regular intervals, equity of access and high quality. Despite the consistent evidence that organised screening is more efficient than non-organised screening, and in spite of the Cancer Screening Recommendations of the European Council, health authorities of eight old member states (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain) have not yet started national organised implementation of screening for cervical cancer. A decision was made by the Irish government to extend their pilot programme nationally while new regional programmes commenced in Portugal and Spain.

CD008054,0,18714567,0,Cost of screening and treatment of cervical dyskaryosis in Germany.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the principal cause of cervical cancer. Clinical trials with HPV vaccines have shown high efficacy against HPV-induced precancerous cervical lesions. Before implementing a vaccination programme, up-to-date data on cervical dyskaryosis, incidence and annual treatment costs are needed. We assessed resource use and costs for 12 months following diagnosis for women with abnormal Pap smears in Germany based on a sample of 138 women who had received abnormal results on Pap smears taken during March and April of 2004. Most women had a Pap IIID (57%) vs Pap III (20%) or Pap IV (23%). Women with a Pap IV consulted their gynaecologist more frequently than those with a Pap III or Pap IIID (5.6 visits vs 4.2 and 4.6 visits, respectively). Only 9% of patients underwent colposcopy plus biopsy; this may be due to the lack of histological assessment by coloposcopy and biopsy done currently in Germany. More women in the Pap IV group had a cold knife conisation, compared with those in the Pap IIID group, (84% vs 27%) hysterectomy (22% vs 4%) and laser coagulation (12.5% vs 4%). Median treatment duration was shorter for women with a Pap III than for those with Pap IIID and IV (3 vs 5 months, respectively). Overall, 28.3% of the women were hospitalised (median 5; range 1-33 days). The estimated average annual cost per patient was Euro 1,055, Euro 943 and Euro 3,174 for Pap III, IIID and IV, respectively. The cost of managing precancerous cervical lesions in Germany was shown to be high."

CD008054,0,10574600,0,Extrapleural solitary fibrous tumor: a clinicopathologic study of 24 cases.,"Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs), rare in extrapleural sites, can present difficulties in diagnosis at these locations. From the files of the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, we accessed 24 cases of extrapleural SFT (14 females, 10 males, ages 19 to 85 yr) obtained for clinical, histologic, immunohistochemical, and follow-up findings. Tumor locations included the head and neck (n = 12), the abdomen (n = 10), and the extremities (n = 2). Tumors were 2 to 25 cm in greatest dimension (mean, 8.2 cm) and were well circumscribed or encapsulated. Histologic features were typical of their pleural counterparts, e.g., bland spindle cells with some hypercellular areas and myxoid to hyalinized backgrounds. A hemangiopericytic vascular pattern was present in 19 cases and prominent in 11. Mitotic activity ranged from 0 to 4 counts per 10 high-power fields. Necrosis was seen in two cases. Focally increased cellularity was seen in seven cases and margins were positive in another seven cases. Spindle cells were positive for vimentin (19 of 19) and CD34 (18 of 20), and negative for cytokeratin (0 of 19). Fibroblastic differentiation was present in the three cases studied by electron microscopy. Flow cytometry in three cases revealed diploid cell populations. Follow-up for 19 cases (9 to 99 mo) revealed no evidence of metastasis, although one patient had residual tumor after an incomplete excision, and one patient died of unrelated causes. Histologic findings such as mitotic counts, necrosis, cellularity, and marginal status were not associated with outcome. We conclude that extrapleural SFTs are clinically and histologically similar to their pleural counterparts. Although the length of clinical follow-up was short (mean follow-up, 41.4 mo), recognizing these lesions is important because they typically follow an indolent clinical course if completely excised. Although CD34 is nonspecific, it is usually positive in SFTs and may aid in their diagnosis."
CD008054,0,17683070,0,Colposcopy is not necessary to assess the risk to the cervix in HIV-positive women: an international cohort study of cervical pathology in HIV-1 positive women.,"The objectives of this prospective multicentre international cohort study are to describe the characteristics of a cohort of HIV-1 positive women and determine the best management system by comparing cervical pathology according to results of cytology, colposcopy and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing at baseline and throughout follow-up. A. Cohorts of known HIV-positive women were recruited from 6 hospital-based European centres and a community-based South African centre. Following registration, women were reviewed every 6 months to undergo cervical surveillance including cytology, colposcopy, histopathology and HPV testing, using the HPV hybrid capture assay. Independent risk factors for the incidence of cytological abnormality and acquisition/clearance of HPV infection during follow up were identified. A total of 1,534 women were recruited, 400 of which were from South Africa. At baseline, among European women, 66% had normal cytology and half were HPV negative and among South African women, 45% had normal cytology and one third (32%) were HPV negative. The sensitivity of cytology (>/=ASCUS) matched with that of colposcopy to detect CIN2+. Rate of detection of high grade CIN at 2 years was similar in European and South African women (11 and 9.3%, respectively). Cytology and HPV testing alone were each sufficiently sensitive as a screening test at 2 yearly intervals. Our data confirm the high prevalence of low-grade cytological abnormalities and high-risk HPV infection. Cytology appears to be sufficient for cervical surveillance, with HPV testing being less specific with poor positive predictive value. There appears to be no additional benefit from routine colposcopy."
CD008054,0,16167918,1,A comparison of the human papillomavirus test and Papanicolaou smear as a second screening method for women with minor cytological abnormalities.,"Of the estimated one million Papanicolaou (pap) smears performed annually in Sweden, about 4% show any degree of abnormality. Approximately, 1% of these cases contain moderate or severe atypia (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions) and the rest contain low-grade atypia. Recommendations for the management of minor abnormalities vary in various parts of Sweden. Generally, a second Pap smear is obtained 4-6 months after the first one showing low-grade atypia. The aim of this study is to compare the sensitivity of human papilloma virus (HPV)-DNA testing for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2-3 with that of a second Pap smear in women, who had low-grade atypia in their first Pap smear."
CD008054,0,19540559,1,The significance of marked nuclear atypia in grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Approximately 10% to 15% of cases of grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia are found to have progressed to a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or higher at follow-up, and there are presently no reliable morphological predictors of this subset. It has recently been reported that cases of grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia that display marked nuclear atypia (defined as cases with at least 5 epithelial cells with nuclear enlargement of at least 5 times the size of an intermediate cell, and/or multinucleation of at least 5 nuclei.) have a substantially higher rate of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion on short-term follow-up and may, therefore, require more aggressive initial management. We report herein our experience with a cohort of such cases. After a review of consecutive cervical biopsies, 352 cases with grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia were classified into group 1 (grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with marked atypia, n = 31) and group 2 (grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia without marked atypia, n = 321). The average follow-up rates for groups 1 and 2 were 93.55% (29/31) and 90.65% (291/321), respectively. Average follow-up durations were 14.3 and 17.9 months, respectively. The follow-up high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion rate of the cases with marked atypia was 10.34%, as compared with 11.68% for cases without marked atypia. The follow-up interpretive frequency (in cytologic samples) of ""low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion"" was significantly higher in group 1(19/29 versus 114/291, P = .009). However, no significant differences were identified between groups 1 and 2 regarding the interpretive frequencies of either high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (3/29 versus 34/291, P = 1) or ""negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy"" (6/29 versus 56/291, P = .8) in follow-up cytologic samples. In subsets of both groups in which high-risk human papillomavirus testing was performed in the Papanicolaou test sample that immediately preceded the index cervical biopsies, no significant differences in viral load were found. In conclusion, grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with marked atypia does not have a higher follow-up high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion rate than grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia without marked atypia in our patient population. Further studies are required to address the significance of marked atypia in grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and whether patients with this finding should be managed differently."
CD008054,0,19540557,0,3q26 (hTERC) gain studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization as a persistence-progression indicator in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cases.,"Gains of 3q26 chromosome region, where the human telomerase RNA gene (hTERC) is located, have been previously documented in cervical carcinomas and preneoplastic lesions. The aim of our study was to define the value of 3q26 gains related to persistence-progression in cervical specimens with cytologic diagnosis for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, using liquid-based cytology (ThinPrep; Hologic, Marlborough, MA) and fluorescence in situ hybridization. For these purposes, 55 patients were included in the study: 25 cases with a negative cytologic diagnosis for squamous intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (20 premenopausal and 5 postmenopausal women, used as control negative cases) and 30 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cases. The follow-up was performed using cytology at 6, 12, and 24 months after the low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion diagnosis. When the cytology result showed a high-grade lesion, colposcopy and biopsy were performed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization technique with a 3q26 2-color commercial probe was performed to determine the number of hTERC copies. There were no differences between premenopausal and postmenopausal normal cases. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cases with regression in the follow-up at 6, 12, and 24 months showed a percentage of cells with 3q26 gains similar to the control cases and lower than low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cases with persistence or progression (P < .05). Fluorescence in situ hybridization results were similar in preserved and frozen samples. However, in frozen samples, the number of cells suitable to be evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization was lower than in preserved (nonfrozen) cases. In conclusion, the determination by fluorescence in situ hybridization of 3q26 gains in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cases could be useful to predict the persistence-progression of such cervical lesions using both preserved and frozen cervical material."

Recent advances in our understanding of viral pathogenesis have provided insights into the natural history of papillomavirus infection and subsequent development of neoplasia. A more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for viral oncogenesis will facilitate the development of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat papillomavirus-associated cervical neoplasias. Strategies under current investigation are focusing on the induction of effective humoral and cell-mediated immunity, the expression of HPV gene products, and cofactors that interact with HPV gene products to affect cell transformation. As a result of these investigative efforts, prophylactic HPV capsid vaccines and other gene therapies may soon become clinically available."

Triage studies have consistently shown that HPV testing is more sensitive that repeated cytology in identifying underlying high-grade lesions in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). Studies that reflect primary screening conditions have shown that the sensitivity of HPV tests is higher than standard cytology in detecting high-grade lesions whereas the specificity is similar only in women aged 30-35 and above. HPV vaccines have an intrinsic attraction as a preventive strategy in populations with limited resources. However, vaccines designed to widespread use are still in development and testing phases.

CD008054,0,15730517,0,A population-based cohort study of KIR genes and genotypes in relation to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Natural killer (NK) cells are involved both in control of virus infections and in elimination of tumor cells. Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) either activate or inhibit NK cell-mediated cytolysis, protecting healthy cells from destruction while enabling killing of abnormal cells. To investigate whether KIR genes or genotypes are associated with cervical carcinogenesis, a nested case-control study of 65 case women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) diagnosed during a 6-year follow-up of 15,234 women and 150 control women from the same cohort that remained healthy was performed. More than 70 different genotypes were observed, and 33 of which had not been described previously. An A-genotype including KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2, KIR2DL3, KIR2DL4, KIR3DL1, KIR3DL2, KIR3DL3, and KIR2DS4 was associated with increased risk of CIN (OR 6.7; 95% CI 1.7-26.3), and KIR2DL5B*002 appeared to have an inverse association with disease (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.5-2.9). There was no association of CIN with the number of activating KIR genes. There was also no association between KIR genes and type of human papilloma virus or with other CIN-related immune response genes. It was concluded that certain KIR genes and genotypes may associate with cervical neoplasia."
CD008054,0,20561781,0,Cetuximab in the management of locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer: expanding the treatment options?,"The treatment of locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) has evolved in recent years as a consequence of a better understanding of the potential benefits associated with altered radiation fractionation regimens, concurrently administered chemotherapy and radiotherapy (chemoradiotherapy) and induction chemotherapy. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is a treatment option for technically resectable disease, where functional morbidity precludes the use of surgery. Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy may also be used in this setting, and has been validated for larynx preservation. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is a standard treatment approach for medically fit patients with locoregionally advanced unresectable disease. However, the toxicity burden of additional chemotherapy in both the concurrent chemoradiotherapy and induction chemotherapy settings can have implications for treatment compliance and may impede the administration of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to schedule. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted IgG1 monoclonal antibody, cetuximab (Erbitux), has shown significant clinical benefits in the treatment of both locoregionally advanced and recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN. A phase III study in locoregionally advanced disease demonstrated significant improvements in locoregional control and progression-free and overall survival with cetuximab plus radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone, and overall survival benefits were maintained at 5 years. The addition of cetuximab to concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been shown to be feasible in phase II trials and is being investigated in phase III trials. Preliminary evidence suggests that cetuximab could be incorporated into induction management strategies. Taken together, these data support an important role for cetuximab in the treatment paradigm for locoregionally advanced SCCHN."
CD008054,0,17390054,0,HIV infection and cancer in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (Review).,"The majority of cancers affecting HIV-infected subjects are those established as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining: Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and invasive cervical cancer (ICC). However, other types of cancer, such as Hodgkin's disease (HD), anal cancer, lung cancer and testicular germ cell tumors appear to be more common among HIV-infected subjects compared to the general population. While not classified as AIDS-defining, these malignancies have been referred to as AIDS-associated malignancies. The mechanisms by which depressed immunity could increase the risk for cancer are unclear, except for in KS and most subtypes of NHL, where it is strictly associated with a low CD4 count. Although it remains unclear whether HIV-1 acts directly as an oncogenic agent, it may contribute to the development of malignancies through several mechanisms (e.g., infection by oncogenic viruses, impaired immune surveillance, imbalance between cellular proliferation and differentiation). Studies of the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the incidence and progression of HIV/AIDS-associated cancers provided contrasting data. While a significant decrease in the incidence of KS has been observed, HAART has not had a significant impact on NHL incidence, particularly systemic NHL, or on ICC, HD, anal cancers and other non-AIDS-defining cancers. Regardless of whether these cancers are directly related to HIV-induced immunodeficiency, treating cancer in HIV-infected patients remains a challenge because of drug interactions, compounded side effects, and the potential effect of chemotherapy on CD4 count and HIV-1 viral load. A better knowledge of viral mechanisms of immune evasion and manipulation will provide the basis for a better management and treatment of the malignancies associated with chronic viral infections."

While advances in radiation therapy and surgical techniques have made the treatment of cervical carcinoma impressive, limitations to successful management still remain. In fact, the 5-year survival rate, stage for stage, has not improved in the United States or world wide in the past 40 years. With an estimated half a million women developing this disease annually, this lack of improved survival poses an international unresolved health problem. Immune response has been shown to be a major factor involved in the course of the disease for this cancer. Immunologic monitoring was also shown to be of effective value in assessing the prognosis for cervical carcinoma. We studied the various immunologic abnormalities in cervical cancer, the effects of radiation therapy on immune function, prospects of an immunologic staging system, the relationship between human papillomavirus infection and the immune response, and the possibility of using in vitro immunologic assessment to provide a better framework for more effective management of cancer of the uterine cervix."

We studied the prevalence and risk factors of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) among systematically followed HIV-infected women enrolled from a population with low HIV prevalence. The study population consisted of 108 HIV-infected women enrolled between 1989 and 2003 with a mean follow-up 4.4 years. Risk factors of SIL were assessed based on samples collected during 2000-02. The overall rates of atypical glandular cells of uncertain significance (AGUS), atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASCUS), low-grade SIL (LSIL) and high-grade SIL (HSIL) were 4, 24, 15 and 5%, respectively. Reduced CD4-lymphocyte count was associated with an increased prevalence of SIL, whereas duration of HIV infection (< or > or =5 years), use of antiretroviral medication, or HIV viral load (<50 or > or =50 copies/mL) was not. The cumulative risk of developing SIL after 1 and 5 years was 17% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7-27%) and 48% (95% CI 33-63%), respectively. The cumulative risk of SIL was increased among women younger than 31 years (P = 0.04) as well as in women displaying high initial HIV viral load (P = 0.01).

More excessive bleeding was presented during the excision at 7 women (6.1%), which was attributed to the pilot step of the introduction of the technique. Coagulation artifacts were presented at 42 women (36.8%), they were significant at 8 (19.1%) of them. Residual disease was found at 7 women (4.9%), all of them with involved margins, but the special attention should receive two cases, one of them with micro invasion up to 750 micron, at the subsequent hysterectomy the residual changes were not found. At the second case the following radical hysterectomy found the residual small cell no keratinized squamous cell cancer with microinvasion up to 3000 micron, without metastases at the regional lymph nodes.

Participants were six purposively selected New Zealand women -- predominantly MÄori -- at least 6 months overdue for a follow-up cervical screen in the previous 6 years. Each woman gave an in-depth interview. Transcribed and analyzed via a general inductive approach, the interviews suggested that the smears can violate women's positive aloneness with their bodies, and magnify aloneness as a negative state. Overdueness for the test avoids these effects. To minimize such effects, primary health care needs to acknowledge and address these issues, for example by providing an opportunity to connect the aloneness to trusted others."
CD008054,0,20718841,0,Cervical cancer screening in Mediterranean countries: implications for the future.,"Prompted by feedback from the 34th European Congress of Cytology (ECC), the practice of including a special symposium in the programme was continued in the 35th ECC in Lisbon (2009) by arranging a satellite symposium entitled 'Cervical Cancer Screening in the Mediterranean Countries'. Because of the importance to the future of this discipline, it was felt appropriate to summarize the highlights of this symposium here. Cervical cancer prevention strategies in the countries participating in the symposium (Portugal, Spain, Italy, Croatia, Greece and Turkey) appear to be highly variable. As yet, none of these countries can demonstrate a fully implemented national screening programme, but all are in different phases of designing and/or setting up such a programme, which is important. At present, the time-honoured concept of cervical cancer prevention by Pap smear screening is under review, because prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines demonstrate a potential to prevent the vast majority (albeit not all) of cases of cervical cancer in the foreseeable future. Cervical cancer screening is still needed in this emerging era of HPV vaccination, but clearly the existing screening strategies must be modified to provide a cost-effective combination of vaccination and screening. If the currently evaluated new screening strategies, such as HPV testing followed by cytology triage, become a reality, there is the likelihood that the Pap test will have only a secondary role, subordinate to HPV testing. Supporters of this scenario claim that Pap test performance will deteriorate in vaccinated populations. Reduced positive predictive value (PPV), due to lower disease prevalence, is inevitable, however, and this would also affect HPV tests. Any decline in sensitivity and specificity depends on human performance, and as such is avoidable by taking appropriate preventive measures. As clinical cytologists, we should focus attention on minimizing the risk to the Pap test of falling sensitivity because of unfamiliarity with abnormal cells, and also of reduced specificity if the fear of missing significant disease leads to overcalling of benign abnormalities."

This article reviews the currently available methods of HPV detection as well as emerging strategies for the implementation of HPV testing into clinical practice.

The presence of HPV DNA in cases of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) has been reported repeatedly from Shantou, China, and other regions with a high incidence of esophageal carcinoma (EC). However, unlike in cervical squamous-cell carcinoma (CSCC), in ESCC, the characteristics of HPV are unclear. Thus, the role of high-risk HPV types in the carcinogenesis of ESCC remains uncertain."

CD008054,0,9497799,0,PCR detection of the human papillomavirus: improved DNA recovery from frozen biopsies.,"1. One of the main obstacles to the reliable detection of human papillomavirus in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is that a minute quantity of infected tissue is often all that is available. 2. In this work, proteinase K-phenol-chloroform-treated sections of frozen cervical biopsies were split in two. Half of the material was precipitated by ethanol in the presence of glycogen, and in the remaining half glycogen was absent. 3. On average a 15-fold increase in total DNA yield was obtained with glycogen. As a result, in 63 cases analysed by PCR for human papillomavirus type 16, we were able to detect nearly 20% more positive samples when glycogen was used. 4. The implications of the improved accuracy of diagnosis are that women requiring a closer follow-up can be identified, and conversely rescreening intervals can be extended for those testing negative for oncogenic human papillomavirus types with more confidence than in the past."
CD008054,0,11480709,0,Obligations to provide appropriate patient management.,"The Pap test is a successful method of preventing cervical cancer, but it does have significant false negative and false positive rates. The main aim of screening is the detection of precursor lesions, both regression and progression of which may occur, making it difficult to decide upon follow-up and further therapy. Around the world there are many differences, as a far as the frequency of the disease, the organization and economic background of the health care system, the use of different additional diagnostic tools and even the terminology considered. All these factors underline the importance of a consensus on a ""minimum level"" of obligations to provide appropriate patient management. The screening interval should be two to five years, in some cases even annually. The cytopathologist has an obligation to recommend repeat smears in cases of cytologic abnormalities likely to regress. We recommend the use of standard terminology and stress the importance of a ""common language"" in cervical cytology. Colposcopy and biopsy are obligatory in cases of HSIL and cancer. We suggest that in severe cases women should be provided with detailed written and verbal information."

A total of 583 initially unsatisfactory ThinPrep slide preparations were identified, and remakes were made with the residual in the PreservCyt (Cytyc) vials with (n = 455) or without (n = 128) GAA. Clinical follow-up information was obtained. The addition of GAA resulted in a 56.5% reduction in unsatisfactory cases, compared with a 26.6% reduction without GAA. Neoplasia and atypia were detected in the reprocessed specimens. The addition of GAA resulted in false-positive HC2 test results in 10 of 10 cases. Neutralization of the specimen may reverse this effect. Reprocessing unsatisfactory ThinPrep specimens with GAA can substantially reduce the overall unsatisfactory rate and result in the detection of significant lesions. However, the addition of GAA can result in false-positive results on HC2 HPV tests."
CD008054,0,9470807,0,Amplification of 11q13 DNA markers in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas: correlation with clinical outcome.,"This study was performed on 282 patients with primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas to evaluate the prognostic importance of 11q13 amplification. Amplification of the 11q13 DNA markers, HST-1/FGF-4 and BCL-1, evaluated by Southern and slot blot hybridisation, was detected in 52% of tumours. 11q13 amplification was associated with tumour site since this alteration occurred in 76% of tumours arising in the hypopharynx, versus 40% in the other sites (P = 0.0007). 11q13 amplification was also significantly related to the presence of involved neck lymph nodes (P = 0.013). The relationship between 11q13 amplification and risk of progression was studied in two subgroups of head and neck cancer patients with regard to treatment modalities. The presence of 11q13 amplification in the tumour was not significantly associated with a shorter event-free survival (P = 0.82) and crude survival (P = 0.61) of the 201 patients treated by surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. Similarly, absence of a relationship was observed for the group of 79 patients treated by surgery alone. These results confirm that 11q13 amplification is a prominent event in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, indicating that it may be a common genetic event in the development of these neoplasms, but is not a reliable prognostic marker."

CD008054,0,14642551,0,Molecular and histopathologic predictors of distant failure in endometrial cancer.,"A case-cohort study was designed to correlate various histopathologic and molecular variables with distant failure in endometrial cancer by analyzing phenotypic and molecular indices in hysterectomy specimens. From an overall population of 283 patients with endometrial cancer, we selected a cohort including all 49 patients who experienced any recurrence and 76 randomly chosen patients without recurrence. Expression of nuclear proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), MIB-1 (a marker of cell proliferation), and p53 was determined with digital image analysis, and cell membrane HER-2/neu and bcl-2 were quantitated visually. Ploidy and DNA indices were determined with flow cytometry. Overall, 6 immunohistochemical and 11 flow cytometric cases were eliminated because of technical inadequacies. Distant failures were defined as primary recurrences that developed outside the pelvis or vagina. Median follow-up was 91 months. Distant failures occurred in 13% of the patients. Cervical stromal invasion, positive adnexae, myometrial invasion >50%, positive lymph nodes, positive peritoneal cytology, lymphovascular invasion, grade 3 histology, nonendometrioid subtype, p53 >33%, strong HER-2/neu membranous staining, aneuploidy, S-phase fraction > or =9%, proliferative index > or =14%, and DNA index > or =1.5 significantly (P<0.05) predicted distant failures. However, a logistic regression model identified only p53 (OR=43.73; P<0.005), lymphovascular invasion (OR=11.59; P<0.001), and cervical stromal invasion (OR=11.29; P=0.001) as cogent predictors of distant failures. Only 3% of patients without any of these three predictors developed distant failures compared with 36% of those with at least one of the three (P<0.01). Thus, locoregional therapy may be insufficient when at least one of these predictors is present."
CD008054,0,7556287,0,A colposcopic scoring system for grading cervical lesions.,"Colposcopic scoring systems have been used for distinguishing low-risk from high-risk cervical lesions. We studied 159 HPV DNA positive patients (7 with HPV 6/11, 51 with HPV 16/18, 52 with HPV31/33/35, 25 with mixed HPV types, and 24 with untypable HPV) (mean age 25.7 years, SD 7.4), and 69 age matched HPV-DNA negative control, patients, drawn from the same clinical setting. A dot-blot hybridization technique (ViraPap and VyraType, Digene Diagnostics, MD, USA) was used for HPV DNA hybridizations types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35. Each patient underwent cytologic and colposcopic evaluation at four-month intervals. A colposcopic score for grading cervical lesions was used. It included features of lesion borders, tone of acetowhitening, and vascular atypia. Each feature was graded using three categories, so that an increasing score would be associated with gradually more severe lesions. The mean follow-up time was 12.2 months (SD 8.7) for the cases, and 12.8 months (SD 6.9) for the controls. The study end point was defined as the presence of cytologic changes consistent with CIN, in which case colposcopically directed biopsy and endocervical curettage were performed. The mean colposcopic score derived from the features of ATZ was 4.9 in the HPV DNA positive patients and 4.3 in the HPV DNA negative patients. The mean colposcopic score was 3.3 for those with HPV 6/11, 4.5 for HPV 16/18, 5.3 for HPV 31/33/35, 5.0 for mixed HPV types, and 4.0 for untypable HPV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008054,0,19585505,0,p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 polymorphism and risk of second primary malignancy after index squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck.,"P73 plays an important role in modulating cell-cycle control, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting cell growth. A novel noncoding p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 exon 2 polymorphism was associated with risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). We hypothesized that p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 polymorphism modulates risk of second primary malignancies (SPM) in patients after index SCCHN. We followed a cohort of 1,384 patients diagnosed with incident SCCHN between May 1995 and January 2007 for SPM development. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare SPM-free survival and SPM risk between the different genotype groups. Our results showed that patients carrying the p73 variant AT allele were less likely to develop SPM compared with the patients with p73 GC/GC genotype (Log-rank test, p = 0.013). Compared with the p73 GC/GC genotype, there was a significantly reduced risk of SPM associated with the p73 GC/AT genotype (HR, 0.61, 95% CI, 0.40-0.93) and the combined p73 GC/AT+AT/AT genotypes (HR, 0.59, 95% CI, 0.39-0.89), but a nonsignificantly reduced risk for p73 AT/AT genotype (HR, 0.44, 95% CI, 0.14-1.41). The p73 AT allele was significantly associated with risk of SPM in an allele dose-response manner (p = 0.011 for trend). The risk of SPM associated with p73 variant genotypes (GC/AT+AT/AT) was more pronounced in several subgroups (e.g., older patients, men, minorities, ever smokers, and ever drinkers). Our results support that this p73 polymorphism may be a marker for risk of SPM among patients with an incident SCCHN."

Historically, the national system of population-based cancer registries in the US has provided high-quality data on cancer incidence and mortality for the most important biologic endpoints, namely, anogenital cancers and some oral cavity/oropharyngeal cancers. There also has been some data collection on cancer precursors; however, this activity has been inconsistent and of lower priority. Because effectiveness against HPV-associated cancers will not be measurable for several decades, strengthening and possibly expanding the capacity of registries to collect precancer data, which are earlier manifestations of infection, must be considered. Collecting type-specific data on HPV-associated precancers and cancers. While keeping in mind the current limitations of registry operations, they discuss resources that may be needed to implement and sustain these types of activities."

It appears plausible that the decrease in estrogen inherent in the postmenopausal state likely produces reactive cytologic atypia, which is misinterpreted as ASC-H. The change in hormone levels observed in pregnant patients, postpartum patients, and contraceptive users, as a corollary, potentially could create a similar diagnostic dilemma. In the current study, the impact of age and altered hormone status on the frequency of ASC-H was assessed to answer the following questions: Is the low predictive value of ASC-H in postmenopausal women an age-related phenomenon, and do other states that result in decreased levels of estrogen relative to progesterone have a similar association?"

Histological malignancy (P = 0.0005), mode of invasion (P = 0.0168) and M/V index (P = 0.0093) showed a significant correlation with survival according to univariate survival analysis. According to multivariate survival analysis (Cox's regression model), the M/V index was the best predictor of the techniques studied of patient prognosis. The M/V index also showed significant correlation with DNA ploidy. The present results suggest that the M/V index is an important prognostic factor for oral carcinoma.

CD008054,0,19331088,1,Cervical cytology screening and management of abnormal cytology in adolescents.,"The consensus guidelines recognize adolescents as a special group and allow for more conservative follow- up of abnormal cytology and histology. The guidelines recognize the role of high rates of HPV infection and reinfection in teens, along with high rates of clearance of HPV and low rates of invasive cervical cancer. Risks of treatment are balanced with risk for disease progression. The cervical cancer vaccine is now recommended for teens. The approved vaccine protects against HPV related disease caused by four subtypes of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. The Food and Drug Administration has approved the vaccine as routine for 11- and 12-year-old girls. The vaccine is most effective prior to HPV exposure or before the sexual debut. In South Carolina only 4.8% of high school girls indicate having sexual intercourse before age 13. Vaccination provides an opportunity to review risky behaviors with adolescent patients and to encourage healthy, safe lifestyles. Vaccination is not protective for sexually transmitted infections and this can be emphasized at vaccination visits as well. The importance of cancer screening can also be reviewed with patients at vaccination visits."

The impact of HPV infection on development of cervical cytological abnormality (dyskaryosis) was monitored by repeat HPV genotyping and cytological assessment 2 years later. Detection of mRNA transcripts of known HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 using NASBA methodology and specific molecular beacons for five common HPV types was also performed at both time points. A total of 11/54 (20%) women developed dyskaryosis after 2 years with 31/54 and 23/54 women exhibiting transient and persistent infections respectively, as monitored by DNA genotyping. Women who maintained type-specific persistent HPV infection were significantly more likely to develop dyskaryosis compared to those who exhibited a transient infection (P = 0.001). The presence of HPV mRNA E6/E7 transcripts was less sensitive but more specific for the detection of disease at follow up. Moreover, women who were DNA positive and also positive for mRNA transcripts at baseline were significantly more likely to harbour persistent infection compared to those in whom DNA only was detected at baseline (P = 0.013). This study highlights the importance of detecting persistent type specific HPV infection to identify those women more at risk of developing cervical abnormalities, either by repeated DNA genotyping, or potentially by RNA based techniques that may be more predictive of persistent infection if performed at a single time point."

Human papillomavirus DNA testing, colposcopy with or without biopsy, and histopathologic examination were conducted as needed. In cytopathologic examination, genomic amplification of TERC was found in 30 of 659 (4.6%) normal or benign cellular changes; in 23 of 170 (13.5%) atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS); in 8 of 28 (28.6%) atypical squamous cells with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion possible (ASC-H); and in 26 of 103 (25.2%) low-grade (LSIL) and 64 of 73 (87.7%) high-grade (HSIL) squamous intraepithelial lesions; with pairwise significant difference (P< 0.05) in each, except ASC-H and LSIL (chi(2) = 0.127, P = 0.72). In histopathologic examination, TERC was amplified in 28 of 671 (4.2%) normal, inflammatory, or wart cases; in 17 of 233 (7.3%) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 cases (CIN 1); in 27 of 39 (69.2%) CIN 2 cases; in 57 of 67 (85.1%) CIN 3 cases; and in 22 of 23 (95.7%) cervical cancer cases; with pairwise significant difference in each (P < 0.05). The number of cells with abnormal signals increased and the abnormal signal patterns were diversified with increasing severity of cervical dysplasia.

DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsies and PCR was carried out to identify HPV types 16, 18, 31, 35, 33 and 45. To detect additional HPV types, consensus PCR products were cloned and sequenced. A catalyzed signal-amplified colorimetric in situ hybridization was carried out in 84 of 106 specimens as a positive control. Response to therapy, progression-free survival (PFS) and cervical cancer-specific survival (CCSS) were the statistical endpoints. Survival analysis was carried out using univariate and multivariate analysis (Cox regression). Ninety-six patients (90.6%) were HPV-positive and 42/96 (43.7%) were positive for multiple HPV types. Eight patients had persistent disease after radiotherapy. From these 8 patients, 7 were infected with multiple HPV types and only 1 patient had an infection with a single HPV type. After a median follow up period of 50 months, patients with multiple HPV infection had a significantly shorter PFS and CCSS compared to those with single HPV infection (24.8% and 34.9% vs. 64% and 60.8%, Log rank, p < 0.01 and 0.04). In multivariate analysis, the presence of multiple HPV types (RR 1.9), node status (RR 2.3), tumor size (RR 3.2) and histologic type (RR 4.8) were independent prognostic factors of CCSS. Our results demonstrate that the presence of multiple HPV types is associated with poor response and with reduced survival in cervical cancer patients who receive radiotherapy as the primary treatment."

CD008054,0,8733047,0,First experiences with genetic counselling based on predictive DNA diagnosis in hereditary glomus tumours (paragangliomas).,"Hereditary glomus tumour (MIM 168,000) or paraganglioma (PGL) is a slowly progressive disorder causing benign tumour growth predominantly in the head and neck region. Though benign in nature the tumours can lead to severe morbidity. Inheritance of PGL is autosomal dominant and is strongly modified by genomic imprinting; only a paternally transmitted PGL gene leads to symptoms. A gene for PGL has recently been mapped to 11q22.3-q23. Genetic counselling on the basis of DNA linkage diagnosis was offered in an extended Dutch pedigree. Thirty-two subjects opted for further counselling, of whom 20 applied for DNA testing and participated in a standardised protocol. Sixteen cases had presymptomatic testing (paternal allele); four of these appeared to have the at risk haplotype and in two of them a glomus tumour was subsequently detected on MRI. In one case linkage results were inconclusive (recombination) and one person did not want to learn his test result. Four cases had testing for carrier status (maternal allele) of which one appeared to be a carrier. Our data show that genetic counselling gains significant accuracy when based on parent of origin, sex of the counsellee, and DNA linkage diagnosis. Moreover, a normal DNA result may prevent unnecessary worry and investigations, while an established presymptomatic diagnosis will guide adequate clinical management. The psychological impact of counselling and predictive DNA testing is unclear as yet. Further investigations into the natural history of PGL in gene carriers and into the psychological impact of DNA testing is desirable."

ASCUS: atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance].,"ASCUS (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance) is a class for reporting cervical cytopathologic diagnoses. The Bethesda System (TBS) introduced ASCUS in 1988 and then defined this cytologic class further. Since the initial subclassification in probably reactive or probably neoplastic , TBS proposed different subgroups for a correct clinical management. At present, the subgroups are the following: ASCUS a) due to compromised specimen (poor processing or obscuring material); b) with mature intermediate-type cytoplasm; c) in postmenopausal women; d) atypical metaplasia; and e) with orangeophilic cytoplasm. Generally, clinical management of ASCUS presents 3 options: 1) cytologic follow-up (colposcopy only in a persistent diagnosis of ASCUS); 2) colposcopy; and 3) both Human papillomavirus testing and Pap-test. These options may be adopted in the ASCUS type b) and e) whereas in the type c) only in postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy. In the ASCUS type a), Pap-test should be immediately repeated (processing defects) or after therapy (excessive inflammation). In postmenopausal women not receiving hormone replacement therapy, the Pap-test has to be repeated after topical estrogen therapy. In ASCUS type d), a more aggressive follow-up is needed, such as colposcopy and eventual biopsy. Therefore, in the ASCUS diagnosis an effective communication between cytopathologist and clinician is needed for a correct clinical management."
CD008054,0,11279397,0,[Controversial categories in cytopathology of the uterine cervix. II. AGUS: atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance].,"AGUS (Atypical Glandular Cells of Undetermined Significance), or AGCUS, is a category for reporting doubtful or suspicious glandular changes of the uterine cervix. Glandular lesions are not well known by the cytopathologist and their cytologic criteria are not completely reproducible. Only with the introduction of The Bethesda System (TBS) in 1988, the presence of endocervical cells is considered essential to correctly evaluate a cervical specimen. The origin of atypical glandular cells, endometrial or endocervical, should be distinguished. Moreover, endocervical AGUS should be further qualified as favor reactive or favor neoplastic or Adeno-carcinoma in situ (AIS) . Recently, it has been proposed to classify endocervical AGUS in a) AIS; and b) AGUS that cannot rule out AIS when incomplete criteria of AIS are present. Moreover, the origin of AGUS is sometimes impossible to know. In these cases, the diagnosis is AGUS not otherwise specified (NOS). The clinical management of AGUS presents different options depending on its origin or its further qualification: cytologic follow-up, colposcopy and eventual biopsy, endocervical or endometrial curettage, hysteroscopy, human papillomavirus typing, etc. including conization and hysterectomy. In conclusion, an appropriate clinical management is needed to detect glandular or squamous lesions that can be frequently identified in the AGUS follow-up."
CD008054,0,9038602,0,Intra-epithelial and invasive cervical neoplasia during HIV infection.,"Patients affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection present an elevated risk of developing cancer. In the last 10 years, the relationship between human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and female cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) has been established. Several studies have described an increased prevalence of both cervical HPV infection and CIN among HIV-positive women compared to HIV-negative ones. A high recurrence rate of CIN after standard treatment has been noted in HIV-infected women and the severity of these lesions seems to be inversely correlated to immune function. Taking into account these data, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) since 1993 have included invasive cervical carcinoma among the AIDS-defining conditions. Once cervical cancer develops in HIV-positive women, the disease may be aggressive and less responsive to treatment. A primary means by which HIV infection may influence the pathogenesis of HPV-associated cervical pathology is by molecular interaction between HIV and HPV genes. Although these have not been well defined, an upregulation of HPV E6 and E7 genes expression by HIV proteins (such as tat) has been postulated by some authors. Cervical cytology appears to be adequate as a screening tool for the cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia in HIV-positive women, but the high recurrence rate and multifocality of this disease reinforces the need for careful evaluation and follow-up of the entire anogenital tract in these women. Probably in the next few years, cervical tumours will represent one of the most frequent complications of HIV infection, a part of progression through AIDS. This points to a need for greater interdisciplinary co-operation for a best disease definition and for the development of effective prevention measures."
CD008054,0,20512116,0,Local immune response in the microenvironment of CIN2-3 with and without spontaneous regression.,"Fifteen to thirty percent of cases with histologically confirmed CIN2-3 in cervical biopsies regress spontaneously (ie, show CIN1 or less in the follow-up cervical cone). The balance between immune-reactive cells from the host and high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) genotypes may provide a biological explanation for this phenomenon. We retrospectively studied 55 cases of CIN2-3 in a cervical biopsy with subsequent cervical cone to assess whether hrHPV genotypes (by AMPLICOR and Linear Array tests) CD4, CD8, CD25, CD138 and Foxp3 cells (by quantitative immunohistochemistry) in the cervical biopsies can predict regression (defined as CIN1 or less in the follow-up cone biopsy). Eighteen percent of the CIN2-3 cases regressed (median biopsy-cervical cone time interval: 12.0 weeks, range: 5.0-34.1 weeks). HPV-16 correlated with low CD8+ and high CD25+. None of the regressing CIN2-3 lesions contained HPV-16. The regressing CIN2-3 lesions had lower numbers of stromal CD138+ and higher numbers of stromal CD8+cells; higher stromal and intra-epithelial ratios of CD4+/CD25+ cells; higher ratios of CD8+/CD25+ cells and lower ratios of CD8+/CD4+, CD138+/Foxp3+ and CD25+/Foxp3+ cells in the stroma. With multivariate survival analysis, stromal CD8+ cell numbers, CD4+/CD25+ cell ratios and CD138+ cell numbers are found to be independent regression predictors. In conclusion, in non-HPV-16 CIN2-3 lesions, assessing stromal immune cells can be a useful prognostic indicator of regression or persistence."

The present study is aimed at testing this hypothesis in a broader prospective, accommodating women between 41 and 50 yr of age from the data derived from the ongoing long-term hospital-based routine cervicovaginal cytology at Queen Mary's Hospital, Lucknow, India. The cervical smears of 31,032 women have been evaluated cytologically during a span of 32 yr (April 1971-March 2003) for early detection of carcinoma cervix and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The incidence of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) was found to be 6.1% while frank malignancy was seen in 0.5% of cases. The following observations were made from the accumulated cytological data: (a) approximately 30% of the total cancer cases was in the age group of 41-50 yr; (b) the maximum number of SIL cases was detected in women between 41 and 50 yr of age (35% of the total SIL cases), and adequate management of these SIL cases would prevent cancer cases from occurring in later years, thus minimizing the maximum incidence of 1.3% observed in women beyond 50 yr of age; (c) the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection also was found quite high in women between 41 and 50 yr old, the adequate management of which would prevent onset/progression of any premalignant changes in the cervix. Our experience of 32 yr of cytological screening substantiates the hypothesis of single lifetime screening between 41 and 50 yr of age as an effective strategy for control of carcinoma cervix in developing countries like ours."

Patients were selected from the medical records of hypertension centers. After exclusion of syndromic patients, 45 patients with familial (F+, n=3) and sporadic (F-, n=42) cases of isolated PHEO/PGL were considered. They included 35 patients with PHEO, 7 with PGL, and 3 with head/neck PGL (hnPGL). Three patients with PHEO (2F-, 1F+) presented VHL mutations (P86A, G93C, and R167W), six with PGL (4F-, 2F+) were positive for SDH or VHL mutations (SDHB R230G in two patients, SDHB S8F, R46Q, R90Q, and VHL P81L in one subject each), and one with hnPGL carried the SDHD 348-351delGACT mutation. We have also detected missense (SDHB S163P, SDHD H50R and G12S), synonymous (SDHB A6A, SDHD S68S), and intronic mutations that have been considered nonpathological polymorphic variants. No mutation was found in SDHC or RET genes. Our data indicate that germline mutations of VHL and SDH subunits are not infrequent in familial as well as in sporadic cases of nonsyndromic PHEO/PGL (overall, 12 of 45 probands, 22%). Accordingly, screening for such mutations seems to be justified. However, a more precise characterization of the functional relevance of any observed sequence variant and of other genetic and environmental determinants of neoplastic transformation is essential in order to plan appropriate protocols for family screening and follow-up."

To determine whether these findings are of clinical significance cervical tissues from 223 patients with squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) or invasive carcinoma and 39 normal healthy cervical tissues were stained with antibody to LA-1 using the immunoperoxidase assay. Tissues from 52 patients with squamous carcinomas at other sites were used as controls. Staining was respectively observed in 46.4, 56.5, and 64.7% of patients with low-grade SIL, high-grade SIL, and invasive cancer. It was localized in the atypical epithelium involving a progressively larger extent of epithelium as a function of increased pathologic grade. Only 10.3% of the normal cervical tissues stained with anti-LA-1 antibody. Twenty-five patients that were lost to follow-up for 2-5 years after the original diagnosis were studied at the time of diagnosis (1 degree biopsy) and when they returned to the clinic (2 degrees biopsy). In the follow-up series, LA-1 staining was observed in both biopsies from 9/12 patients that progressed to a higher degree of atypia, while 9/11 patients whose lesions remained stationary were LA-1 negative. Our studies suggest that LA-1 might be a useful biological marker of cervical neoplasia."
CD008054,0,9461017,0,DNA aneuploidy and infection of human papillomavirus type 16 in preneoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix: correlation with progression to malignancy.,"A microphotometric analysis of nuclear DNA ploidy and detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 DNA was carried out in 50 cases of mild, moderate and severe dysplasia of the uterine cervix along with an equal number of matched controls in order to understand their relative importance in malignant progression of the disease in women. Twenty-two (44.0%) cases of dysplasia showed an aneuploid DNA pattern while positivity for high risk HPV type 16 DNA was found in twenty-three (46.0%) cases. Thirty-four women with twice confirmed mild and moderate dysplasia have been followed up for 24 months. Follow-up data revealed that eight (72.7%) of the 11 patients having an aneuploid DNA pattern and positivity for HPV 16 progressed to carcinoma in situ (CIS) compared to only one (4.4%) case which was positive for HPV 16 with a non-aneuploid DNA pattern. This suggests that a combined analysis of infection of high risk HPV type 16 and aneuploid DNA pattern may serve as an important biological indicator to predict the potential of precancerous lesions of the uterine cervix for progression to malignancy."

CD008054,0,9451555,0,Recent advances in thin-layer cytology.,"In recent years liquid-based cytology has emerged as an alternative to conventional cytopreparatory methods. In particular, the ThinPrep system has found broad acceptance in non-gynecologic cytopreparation. Many laboratories have successfully applied this technique to body fluids (e.g. urine, pleural effusions), brushing samples (e.g. gastrointestinal tract, lung) and fine-needle aspiration. Most comparative studies have shown the ThinPrep system to perform as well as or better than conventional preparations in nongynecologic cytology; plus, the residual cells within the vial can be used for DNA analysis or immunohistochemical and other special studies. Recently, the ThinPrep 2000 system has been approved for use in gynecologic cytology. This approval was based on a large, multicenter clinical study that showed the ThinPrep system to be favored over the conventional Pap smear for the detection of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, or more severe lesions. At screening centers the improved rate of detecting low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) or more severe diagnosis was up to 73%, with an average improvement of 65% as compared to the conventional Pap smears. Also, for specimen adequacy, the ThinPrep method was statistically favored over conventional cytology methods. This multicenter clinical trial demonstrates the ThinPrep 2000 system was more effective than the conventional Pap smear for the detection of atypical cells and cervical cancer and its precursor lesions. In addition, by collecting cells in a liquid-based medium the opportunity is present to improve the Pap test by adjunctive testing for Human Papilloma Virus or other procedures. This creates the opportunity for improved triage and management of patients with cervical abnormalities."

Anderson Cancer Center for recurrent disease after resection of a stage I ovarian serous neoplasm of low malignant potential (SNLMP) are reported. At the time of diagnosis, the age of the patients ranged from 26 to 43 years (mean 33). Seven patients had stage IB tumors and 4 had stage IA tumors. All patients were treated with a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The size of the ovarian tumors ranged from 4 to 15 cm in maximum dimension. Stromal microinvasion was seen in 2 cases, and foci of endosalpingiosis were seen in the peritoneum in 8 cases. Nine patients were treated with radiotherapy and 2 with chemotherapy. The time to recurrent disease ranged from 7 to 39 years (mean 16). Eight tumors recurred in the pelvis or abdomen, 2 in the neck with subsequent abdominal involvement, and 1 in the pleura without abdominal or pelvic involvement. In 10 cases, the recurrent tumors were serous carcinoma, and in 1 case it was a SNLMP. Recurrences were treated with chemotherapy in 10 cases and with hormones in 1 case. Seven patients died of progressive serous carcinoma 2 to 5 years after the recurrence. One patient died of leukemia with recurrent ovarian tumor 10 years after the recurrence was detected. Two patients are alive with progressive disease 1 and 7 years after the recurrence, and 1 patient whose disease recurred as a SNLMP is alive with no evidence of disease 9 years after the recurrence. These 11 patients were compared with 16 patients who had stage I ovarian SNLMPs that did not recur after a minimum follow-up of 15 years. There was no difference in the age of the patients, gravidity, size of the tumors, or several microscopic parameters, including degree of epithelial proliferation, number of mitoses, and nuclear atypia. Microinvasion was found in one case. The only significant difference between the two groups was the low frequency of endosalpingiosis in the cases that had no disease recurrences (12.5% versus 72.7%). In summary, we found no clinical or pathologic features that can unequivocally predict the recurrence of stage I ovarian SNLMPs. Because of the long interval to recurrence, the fact that the recurrent tumors in 10 of 11 patients were serous carcinomas, and the result of the X-chromosome inactivation in one case, the recurrent tumors could represent independent primaries or a slow progression of one clone present in the SNLMPs."

CD008054,0,19756616,0,[Cervical cancer screening: past--present--future].,"Despite the undisputed and impressive success which has been achieved since the 1960s by cervical cytology in the fight against cervical cancer and its precursor stages, during which the mortality rate in industrialized countries over the last 40 years has been reduced by two-thirds to three-quarters, a perfect and error-free screening procedure is still a long way off and will probably never be reached. There are two main reasons for this, the lack of adequate coverage and suboptimal quality and assessment of smears. Two screening procedures are in use Europe, an opportunistic and an organized system. Both systems have many advantages but also disadvantages. In organized programs the coverage is higher (up to 80%), although similar numbers are also achieved by non-organized programs over a 3-year cycle, even if they cannot be so exactly documented. The decision on which system is used depends on the health system of the country, public or non-public, and many other national circumstances. However, in both systems prerequisites for a satisfactory result is a high quality in the sampling technique, the processing and the assessment. Therefore, several guidelines have been introduced by state and medical societies for internal and external quality assurance. New technologies, such as thin-layer cytology or automation for replacement or support of conventional cytology liquid-based cytology proved not to be superior enough to justify the high costs of these systems. The recognition of the strong causal relationship between persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types and cervical cancer and its precursors has resulted in the development of comparably simple tests. Primary screening using HPV typing alone is not recommended in opportunistic screening due to the low specificity but high sensitivity because it leads to many clinically irrelevant results which place women under stress. In organized screening HPV testing is always and only possible in combination with cytology. Various models and approaches are in the testing phase and appear promising. HPV testing is on the other hand well accepted and recommended as a triage test to select women with equivocal smear results (Pap group III, ASCUS) if a biopsy is required or can be followed up and also for follow-up of patients after cone biopsy. However, vaccination of young girls against oncogenic HPV types which has now become widespread still leaves many questions open for the future because the observation period is too short. There is justified hope that this will become a valuable tool in cervical cancer control and may lead to a substantial reduction in the burden of cervical cancer in the future. However, as the current vaccines on the market do not cover all oncogenic virus types and the effects of vaccination will only be observed after many years, the necessity of a cytological screening will remain unrestricted. Therefore, cervical cytology will remain as the trusted, simple to use, economic and proven, like no other method for early cancer detection, efficient procedure even in the foreseeable future. If carried out with the highest quality demands it will play a central role in the early detection of cervical cancer."
CD008054,0,10779811,0,[Screening for cancer: what's new?].,"Setting up of screening programmes for cancers has been the result of evaluation studies but even more of the existence (or non existence) of national policies for cancer control. We know for sure that mammographic screening can reduce breast cancer mortality in women from age 50 onwards, smear screening has a favourable impact on cervical cancer mortality and incidence, and faecal blood testing in stools may reduce colon cancer mortality. Other questions, considered for a long time as settled, are coming back, either because new data are available, such as in screening for breast cancer before age 50, or because new screening methods are being proposed, such as for lung cancer. Finally, the recognition of populations at very high genetic risk makes necessary the search for answers for example for familial breast and/or ovarian cancer.

CD008054,0,12203862,0,Long-term follow-up of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS).,"ASCUS is the most common epithelial abnormality diagnosed in cytology laboratories in the US. Recently, the clinical importance of this diagnosis has been seriously questioned, with some investigators advocating elimination of this diagnostic category. This might be inappropriate if the ASCUS designation does define a population that is at significant risk for the development of dysplasia. Cytology and surgical pathology reports for all patients diagnosed as ASCUS in our laboratory during 1990 were reviewed. Patients with previous dysplasia or carcinoma were excluded from analysis. The pathology reports for the subsequent 9.1 yr were obtained and follow-up data collected. In 1990, 15,860 cervical cytology cases were examined in our laboratory. A diagnosis of ASCUS was made in 1,117 cases (7.0%). After excluding 345 patients with previous dysplasia or human papillomavirus-related diagnoses and 129 patients with no follow-up specimens, 643 study patients remained. Among these, the mean number of subsequent cervical smears was 4.3 (range, 1-18). Subsequent histologic material was available for 134 (20.8%) patients and the mean number of surgical specimens was 1.5 (range, 1-10). Squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) or dysplasia was subsequently diagnosed in 197 patients (30.6%). High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or at least moderate dysplasia was diagnosed in 64 patients (10.0%). In 21 cases (3.3%) the high-grade dysplasia developed more than 2 yr after the first ASCUS diagnosis. Follow-up disclosed no cases of invasive carcinoma. Among ASCUS patients followed for up to 9 yr, 20% develop only low-grade SIL or mild dysplasia and 10% develop HSIL or moderate or severe dysplasia. ASCUS should be retained as a diagnostic category since it identifies a significant percentage of patients who are at an increased risk for the development of cervical dysplasia."
CD008054,0,10879274,0,Carcinoma of the uterine cervix: a review of its pathology and commentary on the problem in Malaysians.,"Since its recognition about 150 years ago, there has been much progress in the understanding of the pathogenesis, prevention, early detection and management of carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Important historical landmarks include the (1) recognition of pre-invasive and pre-clinical lesions, and the devise of various systems for reporting these lesions, (2) improvements in diagnostic techniques particularly colposcopy, (3) advent of therapeutic procedures (electrocoagulation, cryotherapy, laser therapy and loop electrosurgical excision), and (4) recognition of the aetiological relationship between the human papillomavirus and cervical neoplasia. The susceptibility of the cervical transformation zone to malignant change is now well recognised. The WHO classification system remains the one most commonly utilised for histological reporting of cervical cancers. In the recent 1994 update, cervical carcinoma is divided into 3 main categories: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and other epithelial tumours. Squamous cell carcinoma (60-80%) predominates among invasive cervical carcinoma. Recognised variants include verrucous, warty (condylomatous), papillary squamous (transitional) and lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma (5-15% of invasive carcinomas) shows an increasing trend in young females. Like its squamous counterpart, preinvasive and microinvasive versions are known. Variants such as mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, mesonephric, serous, villoglandular and minimal deviation carcinoma are now defined. Adenosquamous carcinoma (5-25%), adenoid-cystic, adenoid-basal, neuroendocrine and undifferentiated carcinomas constitute other epithelial tumours of the cervix. The management of invasive cervical carcinoma remains heavily dependent on its stage. The FIGO staging system remains the most widely used. The 1995 update provides more definite criteria in subdividing stage IA tumours by delimiting stromal invasion of stage IA1 lesions to a maximum depth of 3 mm and a horizontal axis of 7 mm. In Malaysia, an appreciation of the cervical carcinoma problem has to take into consideration the population at risk, its multi-ethnicity, its socio-economic and geographical diversities and the constraints of the health care system. Females form 48.9% of the Malaysian population. 52.9% of them are in the sexually active age group of 15-50 years, indicating a significant population at risk for cervical carcinoma. Cervical carcinoma was the third most common cause of death due to solid tumours among Malaysian females in 1995 following carcinoma of the breast and respiratory tract. East Malaysia is predominantly rural with many communities having limited modern facilities. Such areas imply a lower educational and socio-economic status, raising the worry of a population at higher risk for developing cervical carcinoma. The population: doctor for Malaysia of 2153:1 compares poorly with nearby Singapore. Besides a shortage of doctors, there is also an uneven distribution of doctors, resulting in a ratio in East Malaysia of > 4000:1. Although Malaysia does not have a national cervical cancer-screening programme, many action plans and cancer awareness campaigns have been launched throughout the years, which appear to have made an impact as evidenced by the decreasing mortality rates from cervical carcinoma. Another interesting feature of cervical carcinoma in Malaysia relates to its multiethnic population. In Malaysian Chinese and Malay females, the prevalence of cervical carcinoma ranks second to breast cancer whereas the pattern is reversed in Malaysian Indian females. Studies into its aetiology and pathogenesis are being undertaken and may shed more light on this matter."

Molecular techniques using polymerase chain reaction are a sensitive method to detect a small population of cancer cells among normal cells. We conducted a series of microsatellite analysis to detect cancer cells in saliva from 23 oral and pharyngeal cancer patients. Eight microsatellite markers were selected to test for microsatellite instability (MSI) in the tumor and saliva samples. Of 23 samples, 5 (22%) had MSI in the tumor samples. In 4 of 5 (80%) MSI positive samples, we detected the identical MSI in saliva. The possibility of the molecular screening and molecular follow-up is discussed."

CD008054,0,17058091,0,Intralesional Cidofovir application in recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis.,"Recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis is a benign disease of the larynx often leading to organic and functional restrictions. The therapeutic treatment of choice in larynx-obstructing papillomatosis is at present surgical laser ablation. The effectiveness of adjuvant intralesional injection of the virustaticum Cidofovir has been investigated recently in a variety of therapeutic models. The present case study deals with the treatment of recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis by means of surgical laser ablation of the laryngeal papillomas with adjuvant local injection of the virustaticum Cidofovir (dose of 5 mg/1 ml). Within the period from October 2001 to August 2004, ten patients aged between 5- and 70 years were treated with intralesional injections of Cidofovir. Papillomatosis was confirmed histologically in all cases, and the virus types were defined in part. Each of the patients underwent clinical-phoniatric examinations and was photographed for documentation. After 2-7 treatments with surgical laser papilloma ablation and intralesional Cidofovir injections, all patients showed a definite papilloma reduction, while in six cases complete remission was achieved. During the follow-up period of 8-30 months, not a single recurrence of the laryngeal papillomatosis occurred. In the majority of patients, a clear improvement in the voice was achieved. There were no local or systemic side effects caused by the virustaticum. Intralesional injection of Cidofovir is an adjuvant, but not a curative therapeutic option in recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis. Remission of previously frequently recurrent laryngeal papillomas can be achieved, but recurrence after longer treatment-free intervals is also possible."
CD008054,0,18374480,0,DNA repair of oxidative DNA damage in human carcinogenesis: potential application for cancer risk assessment and prevention.,"Efficient DNA repair mechanisms comprise a critical component in the protection against human cancer, as indicated by the high predisposition to cancer of individuals with germ-line mutations in DNA repair genes. This includes biallelic germ-line mutations in the MUTYH gene, encoding a DNA glycosylase that is involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage, which strongly predispose humans to a rare hereditary form of colorectal cancer. Extensive research efforts including biochemical, enzymological and genetic studies in model organisms established that the oxidative DNA lesion 8-oxoguanine is mutagenic, and that several DNA repair mechanisms operate to prevent its potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic outcome. Epidemiological studies on the association with sporadic cancers of single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes such as OGG1, involved in the repair of 8-oxoguanine yielded conflicting results, and suggest a minor effect at best. A new approach based on the functional analysis of DNA repair enzymatic activity showed that reduced activity of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG) is a risk factor in lung and head and neck cancer. Moreover, the combination of smoking and low OGG activity was associated with a higher risk, suggesting a potential strategy for risk assessment and prevention of lung cancer, as well as other types of cancer."

Together with equivocal cytological abnormalities (ECA), these place a considerable burden on society, but the costs and resource usage are not easily estimated. Therefore, we undertook this study to estimate the burden and costs associated with HPV-related diseases."
CD008054,0,19098603,1,Oncogenic human papillomavirus testing in an adolescent population with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance.,The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology 2006 consensus guidelines state that oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing is unacceptable for patients 20 years and younger with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). The objective of this study is to determine the HPV frequency in ASC-US patients 20 years and younger and to investigate subsequent colposcopic diagnoses.

CD008054,0,20708696,0,Girls' preferences for HPV vaccination: a discrete choice experiment.,"A discrete choice experiment was developed to investigate if girls aged 12-16 years make trade-offs between various aspects of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, and to elicit the relative weight that girls' place on these characteristics. Degree of protection against cervical cancer, protection duration, risk of side-effects, and age of vaccination, all proved to influence girls' preferences for HPV vaccination. We found that girls were willing to trade-off 38% protection against cervical cancer to obtain a lifetime protection instead of a protection duration of 6 years, or 17% to obtain an HPV vaccination with a 1 per 750,000 instead of 1 per 150,000 risk of serious side-effects. We conclude that girls indeed made a trade-off between degree of protection and other vaccine characteristics, and that uptake of HPV vaccination may change considerably if girls are supplied with new evidence-based information about the degree of protection against cervical cancer, the protection duration, and the risk of serious side-effects."
CD008054,0,9108587,0,Epidemiologic analysis of breast and gynecologic cancers.,"This review focuses on etiologic factors and hormonal correlates of the three major gynecologic cancers-uterine cervix, uterine corpus and ovary- and breast cancer. The incidence rate of the three gynecologic cancers combined is only 40 percent of the breast cancer rate (43.6 vs 109.5 per 100,000), whereas the combined mortality rate is half that for breast cancer (14.3 vs 27.3 per 100,000). Cervical cancer is distinctive in that it's hormonal correlates are few; it exhibits the epidemiologic characteristics of a sexually transmitted disease. Integration of Human Papilloma Virus DNA types 16, 18 (or other) within the cellular genome has been identified in more than 80% of high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasias and invasive carcinomas. Epithelial ovarian cancers occur most commonly in nulliparous, infertile women and familial carriers of BRCA1. Oral contraceptive (OC) use reduces ovarian cancer risk by at least one-half, a benefit which increases with increasing duration of use and persists for at least 15 years after discontinuation. Pregnancy and OCs suppress gonadotropin secretion, whereas fertility drugs enhance follicle-stimulating hormone production. These indicators of alterations in the hypothalmic-pituitary-ovarian axis provide some support for both the excess gonadotropin and the incessant ovulation theories of ovarian carcinogenesis. Endometrial carcinoma is the prototype hormonally-determined disease. Increased estrogen from either endogenous or exogenous sources increases risk. Lowering the estrogen load or adding progestin reduces risk. This explains the marked protection achieved by combined estrogen/progestin OC's and the dramatic increased risk uncurred by long-term estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). Breast tissue, also a target for sex steroid hormones, displays a more complex risk profile. Current ERT use increases breast cancer risk by about 30%; adding a progestin to the estrogen does not improve the situation (40% increased risk). Furthermore, OCs do not reduce breast cancer risk, but may increase it for current OC users under age 45. The magnitude of these hormonal effects is much smaller than that exhibited with endometrial cancer."
CD008054,0,11790858,0,Telomerase activity in cervical smears.,"It is well known that almost all carcinoma cells including those of the uterine cervix have re-established their telomerase activity. However, until now there is no conclusive picture on the telomerase activity in cervical dysplasias and about their relationship to HPV infection. To investigate this question, material from 34 patients (15 with normal epithelium, 11 with LGSIL, 8 with HGSIL) obtained by conventional cervical brushing was used and subjected to non-radioactive TRAP-ELISA (Boehringer Mannheim). The HPV analysis was performed by PCR on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy material obtained after cytological investigation. We could show that telomerase activity is detectable in normal cervical epithelium, and that an gradual increase exists for both telomerase activity and HPV positivity from normal epithelium to HGSIL. However, HPV infection and telomerase activity appear to be independent of each other. The high frequency of telomerase positivity in patients with normal cervical epithelium indicates that telomerase activity is not a useful differential diagnostic aid. Whether patients with telomerase-positive dysplasias have a higher probability to progress into an invasive carcinoma remains to be clarified by follow-up studies."
CD008054,0,10874555,0,Second primary cancer after in situ and invasive cervical cancer.,"The Swedish Family-Cancer Database was used to analyze 9,426 second primary cancers in 117,830 subjects diagnosed with in situ and 17,556 subjects with invasive cervical cancer from the years 1958-1996. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) from age- and period-specific rates for all women. SIRs were elevated after both in situ and invasive cervical cancer for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract, anus, pancreas, lung, other female genitals, and urinary bladder. Anus and other female genitals, known targets of human papilloma virus, showed SIRs exceeding 3.0 and 10 or more within the year of diagnosis of cervical cancer, probably implying the effects of diagnostic intensity or transient faltering of host immunosurveillance. Among the remaining sites, smoking appeared to be the major cause, but for urinary bladder cancer it only explained one-half of the excess; human papilloma virus infection, possibly through immunosuppression, could account for the remaining excess. Although urinary bladder cancer showed a relatively small SIR compared with anal cancer, because it is more common, the number of attributable cases was about equal for the two sites. Invasive cervical cancer showed an SIR of 2.3 after in situ cancer. On follow-up, we also observed increased SIRs at many radiosensitive sites 10 or more years after diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer."

Several stimuli can trigger the reactivation of herpes viruses, which are perhaps best recognized in the recurrent blisters and ulcers associated with herpes simplex virus. We present two clinical cases of reactivation of herpes simplex virus during radiation therapy for management of cancers of the head and neck. Although the role of ionizing radiation in the reactivation of herpes simplex virus has not been established, we review the viral and host events associated with the establishment of orofacial herpes simplex virus infection, latency, and reactivation of the virus. We discuss current models of viral reactivation and suggest directions for further clinical research into the reactivation of orolabial herpes simplex virus during radiotherapy."

The introduction of angiogenesis inhibitors, growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and cell cycle regulators into clinical trials for the management of OCSCC has resulted from the great strides made in the understanding of tumor biology. It is important for those caring for patients who have OCSCC to have a firm background in tumor biology, because many future therapies will be based on this complex panorama of cellular physiology."
CD008054,0,18544049,0,"Quality control for normal liquid-based cytology: rescreening, high-risk HPV targeted reviewing and/or high-risk HPV detection?","The objective of this prospective study was to compare the number of CIN2+cases detected in negative cytology by different quality control (QC) methods. Full rescreening, high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV)-targeted reviewing and HR HPV detection were compared. Randomly selected negative cytology detected by BD FocalPoint (NFR), by guided screening of the prescreened which needed further review (GS) and by manual screening (MS) was used. A 3-year follow-up period was available. Full rescreening of cytology only detected 23.5% of CIN2+ cases, whereas the cytological rescreening of oncogenic positive slides (high-risk HPV-targeted reviewing) detected 7 of 17 CIN2+ cases (41.2%). Quantitative real-time PCR for 15 oncogenic HPV types detected all CIN2+ cases. Relative sensitivity to detect histological CIN2+ was 0.24 for full rescreening, 0.41 for HR-targeted reviewing and 1.00 for HR HPV detection. In more than half of the reviewed negative cytological preparations associated with histological CIN2+cases no morphologically abnormal cells were detected despite a positive HPV test. The visual cut-off for the detection of abnormal cytology was established at 6.5 HR HPV copies/cell. High-risk HPV detection has a higher yield for detection of CIN2+ cases as compared to manual screening followed by 5% full review, or compared to targeted reviewing of smears positive for oncogenic HPV types, and show diagnostic properties that support its use as a QC procedure in cytologic laboratories."

CD008054,0,20697958,0,Frequency of extracolonic tumors in Brazilian families with Lynch syndrome: analysis of a hereditary colorectal cancer institutional registry.,"Lynch syndrome (LS) is caused by inherited germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes. It is one of the commonest forms of inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer (CRC), accounting for 2-5% of all CRC. LS is characterized by early age of onset, with a tendency for multiplicity and an increased risk for extra-colonic tumors at particular sites. In this study we have evaluated the frequency of extra-colonic tumors in 60 unrelated LS families fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria (ACI. ACII) from the Oncotree database of the Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Registry of the AC Camargo Hospital. All families' pedigree was extensively analyzed, varying from 2 to 6 generations with a total of 2,095 individuals evaluated. As expected, colorectal cancer was the most frequent tumor in the families (334 cases). We found 200 extracolonic tumors among all individuals with a higher ratio in women (123 cases) than men (77 cases). By far, breast cancer (32 cases) was the most frequent extracolonic manifestation in women followed by endometrial (20 cases) and uterine cervix cancer (20 cases). For man, prostate (16 cases) and stomach (12 cases) cancer were the most frequent extracolonic tumors. It is well know that establishing the diagnosis is challenging and requires knowledge and surveillance. Thus, recognition of individuals and families with hereditary predisposition to cancer according to clinical and molecular features, combined with intensive surveillance and management programs, can contribute substantially to improve results related to the diagnosis and characterization of LS."
CD008054,0,7811546,0,Management of the female HIV-infected patient.,"Management of women with HIV infection or AIDS should follow the established guidelines for antiretroviral therapy and prevention and treatment of opportunistic complications of HIV infection. Gynecological manifestations of HIV are primarily cervical dysplasia and cancer associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and vaginal and mucocutaneous candidiasis. Human papillomavirus-associated cervical dysplasia/neoplasia is more common in women with advanced rather than early HIV disease, and monitoring with Pap smears should probably increase to every 6 months in patients with CD4+ cell counts < 500 cells/microliter (and certainly when this value falls below 200), with positive Pap smears confirmed by colposcopy and biopsy. For patients with CD4+ cell counts > 350 cells/microliter, cryotherapy is probably adequate, but therapy should be increasingly aggressive at lower CD4+ cell counts. Results of ongoing studies should be available soon to guide therapy. Optimal treatment of candidiasis in HIV-infected women includes prevention of recurrence with a combination of topical and systemic antifungal agents. Women with child-bearing potential should be treated as medically indicated for other HIV-infected patients, including during pregnancy. In fact, preliminary results of ACTG 076 indicated that zidovudine therapy during pregnancy reduces vertical transmission of HIV about threefold."
CD008054,0,18338752,0,Cervical cancer screening program integrating Pap smear and HPV DNA testing: a population-based study.,"We conducted a population-based cohort study to evaluate the complementary value of HPV testing to Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and the prevalence and genotype distribution of HPV in Taiwan. In this report, we described the design of the whole study and analyzed the cross-sectional results. Female residents (age >or= 30 years) of Taoyuan, Taiwan were invited. After signing informed consent, every participant had a Pap smear and a HPV testing. Patients with Pap >or= atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance (Group I) or those with HPV-positive but normal cytology (Group II) were referred for a colposcopic examination. A total of 10,014 women were eligible. The overall HPV prevalence was 10.8% (95% confidence interval 10.5%-11.4%) in the study population. A total of 37 types of HPV were identified and the leading three were HPV-52, -18 and -58. There was a significant positive correlation of HPV prevalence with older age, postmenopausal status, current-user of oral contraceptives and never-user of hormone replacement therapy. Past users of oral contraceptives and never users of Pap were associated with higher risk of abnormal Pap, while age 40-49 strata had lower risk. Fifty-nine cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 from Group I and additional 11 from Group II were identified. The improvement of sensitivity with additional HPV testing was 15.3%. Besides, no specific subgroup was found to most benefit from the combined strategy. The value of adding HPV test to conventional Pap smear has to be evaluated after longer-term follow-up of this population-based cohort."
CD008054,0,19442563,0,Biomarkers in dysplasia of the oral cavity: a systematic review.,"Oral dysplasia is a potentially precancerous lesion diagnosed histologically. While the risk of progression is associated with histological grade, it is currently impossible to predict accurately which lesions will progress. More accurate markers predicting progression to cancer would enable the targeting of these lesions for more aggressive treatment and closer follow-up. We have performed a systematic review with pooling of data to assess the evidence for the use of biomarkers in predicting transformation of oral dysplasia into cancer. We systematically searched the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, Cinahl and the Kings Fund electronic databases using the terms: oral dysplasia, leukoplakia, erythroplakia, biomarkers and genetic markers. The following a priori selection criteria were used: longitudinal cohort or case-controlled studies of oral dysplasia that progressed to cancer. Cross-sectional studies and studies reporting only on leukoplakia were excluded. Data were extracted by two reviewers. Quality assessment was carried out using validated tools. We assessed the relative risk of progression form oral dysplasia to cancer and pooled data where possible. 2550 studies were identified, from which 288 were scrutinised in greater detail. Of these, 247 were excluded, mainly due to cross-sectional design. Of the 41 studies containing follow-up data, 28 were excluded, most commonly due to data only being available for lesions once they had progressed to cancer. A lack of clear histological definition of oral lesions was also a common finding. Data were extracted from 13 longitudinal studies. The evidence consists mainly of small, single centre, retrospective studies. In oral dysplasia, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), particularly at the 3p+/-9p loci, increases the risk of progression to cancer (RR 17.60 (2.77, 108.37) p<0.001), as does survivin (RR 30 (4.25, 197.73), p0.001), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP 9), (RR 19.00 (1.56, 209.38) p=0.02) and DNA content (RR 12.00 (1.17, 82.10) p=0.03). Other markers identified by this review including p53, p73, MMP 1 and 2 and cathepsin L mRNA, did not predict progression. LOH, survivin, MMP 9 and DNA content are potential markers for increased risk of progression from oral dysplasia to cancer. Many methodological limitations have been identified by this review, however, and we recommend these results are interpreted with caution. Research into this field should concentrate on longitudinal design, with pooling of data from multiple centres to achieve larger cohorts. We recommend standardisation of definitions to allow appropriate comparisons to be made."

CD008054,0,14692223,0,Burkitt's lymphoma of the scapula.,"Burkitt's lymphoma may involve the maxilla or mandible, but to date, there has been no reference in the literature to scapular involvement by this tumor. This article describes the case of a 9-year-old child who presented with a huge tumor involving the right shoulder with osteolytic and sclerotic lesions in the scapula. The histopathological findings were suggestive of Burkitt's lymphoma, and the immunohistochemical findings discard a lymphoblastic lymphoma or plasmablastic lymphoma. In addition, in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded small nuclear RNA (EBER) was positive. Although the child also presented a cervical lymphadenopathy, the fact that Burkitt's lymphoma is generally extranodal, the marked swelling of the shoulder, and the extensive involvement of the bone strongly argue that this tumor had its origin in the scapula. This case demonstrates the importance of including Burkitt's lymphoma in the differential diagnosis of lymphoma involving bones in children."

Diagnosis was made according to cytological and histological alterations, distinguishing among vaginal infections, and pre-cancerous and cancerous cervical lesions. We also looked at the annual prevalence of the various types of infections and alterations. There was a high prevalence of bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis and candidiasis, with suggestive changes over the years. Pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions increased 2.2 fold during the six years. A large proportion of the cases involved late stages of cervical cancer, indicating the necessity of prompt attendance of the population in a routine gynecological prevention program."

CD008054,0,9103401,0,Physical status and expression of HPV genes in cervical cancers.,"It is known that E2 protein of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) inhibits the expression of E6 and E7 genes from their major promoters in vitro and suppresses the proliferation of cervical cancer cells. This suggests that the loss of functional E2 gene may provide selective advantages in the development of cervical cancer. Investigation of the relationship between the disruption of HPV-16/18 E2 genes by DNA integration and clinical outcome of cervical cancer may not only help to understand the mechanism of HPV-related cervical carcinogenesis, but may also provide novel management of cervical cancer. It was noted that integrated HPV-16/18 DNA was predominant in most patients with cervical cancers, marking 51 of a total of 68 cases (75%); episomal HPV DNAs were found in 5 cases (7.4%), and finally mixed forms of HPV DNAs with episome and integration were found in 12 cases (17.6%). Whole portions of E2 DNA of HPV-16 could be amplified by PCR in 19 (36.5%) of 52 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. It was shown that there was not statistically significant association with the different stages, but integrated HPV DNAs were detectable only in the patients with far-advanced stage of cervical cancers, which also means no episomal forms were detected. Episomal forms of HPV DNA were detectable in 14 (25.9%) of 54 squamous cell carcinomas (4 pure episomal forms and 10 mixed forms), whereas only 1 (8.3%) of 12 adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous cell carcinomas contained episomal viral DNA. When HPV DNA forms were compared with initial tumor size, lymphovascular space involvement, and frequency of nodal metastasis, statistically significant relationships were not found. The association of DNA integration with invasive cervical cancers was seen regardless of HPV type; however, there were differences between the integration profiles of HPV-16 and HPV-18 DNA. Of the 51 HPV-16-containing cancers, 36 (70.6%) revealed purely integrated HPV DNA, and another 10 cases (19.6%) displayed both integrated and episomal HPV DNAs. However, 5 (9.8%) cases showed only episomal copies of the HPV-16 genome. In contrast, all 17 HPV-18-containing cancers (5 cases positive for HPV-18 and 12 cases positive for both HPV-16 and -18) revealed only the integrated form of HPV-18 DNA. The expression of E6 and E7 transcripts of HPV-16/18 is uniformly correlated with the physical status of HPV DNAs. HPV E2 mRNAs were constantly expressed in the presence of the intact virus in cases with episome and mixed forms of HPV DNA. In general, amplified signals from HPV E2 RT-PCR are more intensive than those from DNA-PCR in the same patients. It is suggested that RT-PCR is a valuable method to evaluate dynamic expression of the specific gene and seems to be more sensitive than the DNA-PCR method in detecting intact E2 gene because of the gene copy numbers."
CD008054,0,9322622,1,Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid detection in mildly or moderately dysplastic smears: a possible method for selecting patients for colposcopy.,"Current screening protocols for cervical cancer dictate that patients with smears read as mild or moderate dysplasia of the uterine cervix undergo colposcopy, although approximately half these women do not prove to have high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. The aim of this study was to determine whether human papillomavirus testing is capable of discriminating between high- and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions so as to be useful in reducing the number of colposcopic examinations."
CD008054,0,20432728,0,Liquid-based cytology--new possibilities in the diagnosis of cervical lesions.,"Liquid-based cytology (LBC) enables the use of supplementary methods in the diagnosis and prognosis of cervical lesions. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between p16-INK4a immunoexpression in ThinPrep cervical cytologic samples and human papillomavirus (HPV) detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the same sample. LBC-ThinPrep (Cytyc, USA) cervical cytology samples, prepared and stained by Papanicolaou method, were analyzed using modified Bethesda cytologic classification named ""Zagreb 2002"". A second ThinPrep slide, prepared from the same sample, was immunostained for p16INK4a using CINtec p16INK4a Cytology Kit (DakoCytomation, Denmark). Increased expression of the high-risk (HR) HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes results in a highly specific increase in p16 protein expression and overexpression of p16INK4a acts as a potential biomarker for cervical cancer progression from premalignant lesions. Brown nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining of abnormal cells was considered a positive result. Residual material was used for 13 HR HPV-DNA detection by the PCR based AMPLICOR HPV test (Roche Molecular Systems). A total of 120 ThinPrep Pap tests with the following cytologic diagnoses: 17 within normal limits, 17 atypical squamous cell (ASC) (7 ASC of undetermined significance /ASCUS/ and 10 ASC of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions cannot be excluded /ASC-H/), 26 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) corresponding cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 57 high-grade SIL (HSIL) i.e. 24 CIN II and 33 CIN III and 3 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were included in the study. All CIN III (n = 33) and SCC (n = 3) specimens expressed p16INK4a immunoreactivity, whereas the HR HPV test was positive in 97% (32/33) of CIN III and 100% (3/3) of SCC specimens. The p16INK4a biomarker was positive in 87.5% (21/24) of CIN II and 69% (18/26) of CIN I, while the HR HPV was positive in 75% (18/24) of CIN II and 50% (13/26) of CIN I. In ASCUS cytology, p16INK4a and HR HPV showed the same rate of positivity (28.5%; 2/7). Expression of p16INK4a was detected in all cytologic (10/10) ASC-H lesions, in contrast to HR HPV detected in only 20% (2/10) of ASC-H cases. These data suggest the p16INK4a evaluation in ThinPrep cervical samples to be significantly associated with HR HPV testing by PCR in the same sample for the diagnosis of HSIL lesions and cervical carcinomas. A prospective study with longer follow up may clarify the predictive values in the management of LSIL and ASC diagnosis."
CD008054,0,17325353,0,Seroprevalence of human papillomaviruses and Chlamydia trachomatis and cervical cancer risk: nested case-control study.,"A nested case-control study of invasive and in situ cervical cancer was performed within a community-based cohort of 13,595 Taiwanese women assembled in 1991, with a follow-up period of 9 years. Baseline serum or plasma samples were analysed for antibodies against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 16 and 18 and Chlamydia trachomatis. In total, 114 cases (42 incident cases identified during follow-up and 72 prevalent cases identified at baseline) and 519 matched controls were included in the study. HPV-16 seropositivity was strongly associated with cervical cancer (OR=6.33; 95% CI 3.45-11.62). Overall, C. trachomatis was not associated with cervical cancer, but was associated with cervical cancer in analyses restricted to incident cases of cancer (OR=2.94; 95% CI 1.17-7.42) or to cases in which serum samples were analysed (OR=3.13; 95% CI 1.16-8.47). An antagonistic interaction between HPV-6 and -16 was found in a multiplicative model. These results suggest that different HPV types might interfere in cervical carcinogenesis and that C. trachomatis is associated with cervical cancer in prospective studies, and support the notion that HPV-16 seropositivity is strongly associated with cervical cancer."

CD008054,0,17724715,0,The impact of new technologies in cervical cancer screening: results of the recruitment phase of a large randomised controlled trial from a public health perspective.,"The decision to introduce liquid-based cytology (LBC) and HPV as screening tests involves criteria based on resource consumption. We used cross-sectional data at recruitment from the NTCC trial [ISRCTN81678807] on 28,000 women aged 35-60, randomised to receive a conventional Pap test or LBC plus HPV. We computed the resources employed to detect a CIN2+ with different screening strategies. In order to result in the same overall cost per CIN2+ detected as screening by conventional cytology, the unit cost of LBC used alone should be less than that of a conventional Pap while its unit cost may be up to 20% higher if HPV-triage for Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance is applied together. With the same criterion the unit cost of HPV used alone may be about 20% higher than that of a Pap-test using a 1 pg/ml cut-off and over 40% higher using a 10 pg/ml cut-off. If HPV testing is applied with cytology-triage, a single HPV test may cost 20-30% more than a conventional Pap to result in the same overall cost per CIN2+ detected."
CD008054,0,11874067,0,Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia: current perspectives.,"The heterogeneous clinical features of vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), its uncertain and variable natural history, difficulties in the management of certain cases and the frequency of recurrences provide a continuing challenge for gynaecologists. Patients with VIN present to a diverse range of physicians, all of whom provide differing perspectives on the multifarious issues relating to the condition. The importance of VIN relates principally to the symptoms it causes and its potential to progress to invasive vulval cancer. Both the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Diseases and the International Society of Gynaecological Pathologists have stressed the importance of eliminating eponymous terminology and recommend only the term vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN). This terminology includes both squamous and non-squamous varieties (Table 1). The latter includes both Paget's disease of the vulva and melanoma in situ. Non-squamous VIN will not be considered in this paper. Until 30 years ago VIN was an uncommon condition, seen principally in middle and later life. The incidence particularly in younger women has increased significantly since then [1-3]. Since that time the mean age in our unit has fallen from 52.7 years to 35.8 years (Figure 1) [2]. The increasing incidence of the condition parallels similar trends in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and relates at least in part to changing sexual morÃ©s, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, and cigarette smoking."
CD008054,0,20698164,0,Advances in cervical cancer control and future perspectives.,"The knowledge that the persistent infection with high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) is the etiological factor in the development of cervical cancer has led to the development of the HPV DNA detection methods as well as the prophylactic vaccine against the most common HR-HPV types, HPV 16 and 18. Despite HPV vaccination, cervical cancer screening will remain the main preventive measure for both vaccinated and non-vaccinated women, but the nature of screening and management of women with cervical disease is being adapted to the new technologies. Although, HPV DNA detection is more sensitive that cytology, its specificity is lower, since most HPV infections are transient. Therefore, other methods are considered to improve the management of women with cervical disease. Typing of HPV DNA and viral load measurements are still used for research purposes only. Detection of viral oncogene E6/E7 transcripts, which is the marker of the productive infection, is a promising tool for follow-up of HPV DNA-positive women. The detection of p16INK4a over-expression, as an indirect test of E6/E7 expression, is used for confirmation of cervical neoplasia. Despite the lack of standardization, the detection of p16INK4a is useful in clinical settings, however its reproducibility in the management of low-grade and borderline cases is low. Future perspectives include the determination of the methylation status of several cellular genes that could predict the progression of the disease."

Two weeks after treatment, inflammation and ulceration of the cervix were accompanied by major increases in mean concentrations of HIV-1 RNA (200-fold), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 6, and soluble markers shed by activated lymphocytes and macrophages (sCD25 and sCD14, respectively) in CVL samples (P<.01 for each), but not plasma. Strong temporal and quantitative correlations were observed between concentrations of immunological markers and HIV-1 load in this compartment during a 10-week follow-up. Furthermore, in the presence of genital ulceration, HIV-1 in CVL samples was more readily captured by antibodies directed against virion-associated HLA-DR, a marker of host-cell activation, compared with virus in plasma. We suggest that local immune activation increases HIV-1 load in genital secretions, potentially increasing the risk of HIV-1 transmission."

Since then, dozens of new HPV types have been discovered, routes of transmission have been delineated, estimates of prevalence and incidence have been described, carcinogenic properties have been demonstrated, and prophylactic HPV vaccines have been developed and deployed. It is now well-established that certain HPV types, prominently HPV-16 and HPV-18, cause cancers of the uterine cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus, oral cavity, and oro-pharynx; cancers that are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. More recent findings indicate that widespread adolescent HPV vaccination could substantially reduce the global burden of such HPV-related cancers.

CD008054,0,17624079,0,Prophylactic HPV vaccines.,"Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), in particular HPV 16 and HPV 18, is the main cause of cervical cancer. Two prophylactic vaccines against types 6, 11, 16 and 18 have shown great promise in clinical trials, with recent results demonstrating 100% efficacy against persistent HPV infection and development of CIN up to five years of follow-up. One of these (Gardasil, recently licensed) contains all four HPV types, offering protection against genital warts (types 6 and 11) as well as cervical cancer. The other (Cervarix) contains types 16 and 18, targeting cervical cancer alone. Recent data suggest a degree of cross-protection, against types 31 and 45; this could significantly increase the level of protection afforded by the vaccines. It is envisaged that girls between 11 and 12 will be the target, and this is what has been recommended in the United States. There is still debate about the issue of vaccinating boys. A fundamental issue is the lack of education of both the public and health professionals about HPV. In theory, an HPV vaccine could prevent almost all cervical cancer, eventually removing the need for cervical smears. However, there is at least one whole generation of women for whom the vaccine will come too late, and who will continue to require screening."
CD008054,0,10981235,0,[Human papillomavirus and screening for cervical cancer: state of art and prospects].,"More than 99% of all cervical cancers contain high risk HPV. Only a persistent infection with high risk HPV of the cervical epithelium results in cervical cancer. Because the risk of cervical cancer is identical for all different HPV types, tests which detect all 14 high risk HPV types at one time are sufficient for clinical management. Testing for hr-HPV is mandatory for women with mild dyskaryosis and for the follow-up of women treated for CIN lesions. Based on efficiency to detect CIN3 and cervical cancer and preliminary cost benefit analysis, the combination of a high risk HPV test in conjunction with a cervical smear appears to be the best way of cervical cancer screening. A definite point of view on using high risk HPV testing for primary screening for cervical cancer will be obtained after the completion of a randomized trial of 44,000 women, in which the efficiency to detect CIN3 and cervical cancer by high risk HPV testing in conjunction with a cytomorphological smear is compared with screening by classical cytology."

CD008054,0,11103102,0,Intimate partner violence and cervical neoplasia.,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with a range of adverse physical health outcomes, including chronic and infectious diseases. An emerging literature suggests that partner violence and specifically sexual violence may be associated with an increased risk of cervical neoplasia. To assess the risk of preinvasive and invasive cervical cancer in a cross-sectional study of women screened for IPV by type, frequency and duration, 1152 women ages 18-65 were recruited from family practice clinics in 1997-1998. They were screened for IPV during a brief in-clinic interview, and health history and current status were assessed in a follow-up interview. Of 1152 women surveyed, 14 (1.2%) reported cervical cancer, and 20. 3% (n = 234) reported treatment for cervical neoplasia. Ever experiencing IPV was associated with an increased risk of invasive cervical cancer (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 4.28; 95% CI 1.94, 18.39) and with preinvasive cervical neoplasia (aRR = 1.47; 95% CI 1. 16, 1.82). This association was stronger for women experiencing physical or sexual IPV than for women experiencing psychological IPV. Women with cervical cancer reported being in violent relationships longer and experiencing more frequent physical and sexual assaults and more IPV-associated injuries than did controls. This exploratory study suggests that IPV may increase a woman's risk of cervical neoplasia. The mechanism by which IPV effects cervical neoplasia may be indirect through psychosocial stress or negative coping behaviors or direct through sexual assaults and transmission of human papillomavirus (HPV)."

Concurrent chemotherapy has shown to improve survival, although its efficacy in endemic regions requires confirmation. Determination of circulating cell-free Epstein-Barr virus DNA might detect early recurrence. For patients who developed recurrence in the neck, surgery provides good salvage. For small tumor in the nasopharynx, good results can be obtained with reirradiation therapy, brachytherapy or surgery.

PIM has been suggested to be a subset of condyloma associated with low-risk type human papilloma virus (HPV), however, the etiologic role of HPV and biologic behavior of the disease are still elusive. We compared the clinical and histopathological findings, immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67 and p53 protein, and HPV typing of 5 cases of PIM with SM (n=9), HSIL (n=6), and PSC (n=4) to know the helpful features for the differential diagnosis. Histologically, all 5 cases showed a papillary proliferation of immature metaplastic cells involving the proximal transformation zone and endocervix. On HPV typing by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, 2 out of 5 PIM were confirmed to have HPV 6 or HPV 11, while 2 out of 4 PSC were proved having HPV 31 and HPV 16 each. Ki-67 labeling index and mitotic index of PIM were significantly lower than those of HSIL or PSC. There were no significant differences of Ki-67 labeling index and mitotic index between PIM and SM. The expression of p53 varied among the groups and thus it was not helpful for the differential diagnosis."
CD008054,0,18328945,0,Detection of human papillomavirus genotypes with liquid bead microarray in cervical lesions of northern Chinese patients.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer. Blending multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and multiplex hybridization to liquid bead microarray (LBMA), we detected and identified 25 common HPV genotypes using type-specific primers for HPV E6 and E7 genes in cervical lesions of northern Chinese patients. Of the 511 cervical samples, 349 (68.3%) were found to be HPV positive by HPV-LBMA. The distribution was 22 HPV positive of 100 in the control group (22%), 41 of 80 with chronic cervicitis (51%), 80 of 99 with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I (81%), 46 of 56 with CIN II (82%), 67 of 74 with CIN III (90%), and 93 of 102 with invasive cervical carcinoma (91%). HPV-16 was the most frequent genotype in the CIN and cervical cancer groups. The most common genotypes were HPV-16 (28%), HPV-58 (14%), HPV-52 (14%), HPV-18 (8%), and HPV-33 (7%) in the CIN group, and HPV-16 (63%), HPV-52 (9%), HPV-18 (7%), HPV-58 (7%), and HPV-33 (5%) in the cervical cancer group. HPV-LBMA found multiple genotypes in 1 of 22 control (4%), 64 of 193 CIN (33%), and 22 of 93 cervical cancer (24%). The HPV-LBMA results were compatible with those of PCR and DNA sequencing. HPV-LBMA is a simple, high-throughput method that provides useful information on viral genotype and multiple HPV infections in cervical lesions. In northern China, the most common high-risk HPV genotypes seem to be HPV types 16, 58, 52, 18, and 33. Genetic information on HPV in cervical specimens could provide particular benefits in the management of cervical lesions."

CD008054,0,10380373,0,HLA DOA1 and DOB1 loci in Honduran women with cervical dysplasia and invasive cervical carcinoma and their relationship to human papillomavirus infection.,"Molecular and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), mainly HPV-16 and HPV-18, are the primary causes of cervical cancer and its precursor lesions; there is now evidence for a clear association with specific HLA class I and class II loci contributing independently to the expression of cervical cancer. Among Honduran women carcinoma of the cervix is the most common type of cancer, and infections with high-risk HPV types are highly prevalent. To study the interactive role of viral-host genetics, we performed PCR amplification of DNA and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe typing on cervical scrapes from 49 women [24 with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stage III or cervical cancer (severe cases) and 25 with stage I or II cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (mild cases)] and 75 control subjects to look for possible associations between HPV and HLA class II DQA1 and DQB1 alleles in the development of dysplasias and invasive cancer. This analysis revealed a predominance of HLA-DQA1*0301 among severe-case patients [relative risk (RR) = 3.45, p = 0.008), whereas DQA1*0501 was negatively associated (RR = 0.30, p = 0.03), suggesting a protective effect of this allele. HPV typing showed a decreased relative risk among the HPV-16 or HPV-18 carrying patients and other HPV-related positive patients in the presence of DQB1*0602 compared with positive control subjects (p = 0.04). No statistically significant allele frequency difference was observed between mild dysplasia cases and control subjects. The results suggest that DQA1*03011, which is in linkage desequilibrium with all HLA-DR4 alleles, confers an increased risk for severe cervical dysplasia and invasive cancer, whereas DQA1*0501, which is in several DR52 haplotypes, has a protective effect. Furthermore, specific HLA-DQB1 sequences may be important in determining the immune response to HPV peptides and may affect the risk for cervical cancer after HPV infection in mestizo Honduran women."

CD008054,0,17227641,0,Cervical cancer screening in Thailand: an overview.,"In Thailand, there have been no 'organized' programmes of screening for cervical cancer. For the most part, screening has been unsystematic or provided to women 'on demand'. In 2002, the Department of Medical Services of the Ministry of Public Health proposed the screening of the entire population of women in Thailand at 5-yearly intervals from the ages of 35 to 60 years. As a first step, measures to increase the capacity for obtaining and interpreting papanicolaou (Pap) smears have been put in place. Research studies have examined the effectiveness of screening with Pap smears in Thailand, and confirmed that, as elsewhere, protection is related to the number of previous tests and the time elapsed since the most recent one. Coverage of the population remains low. Other methods of screening are being investigated in Thailand, including visual inspection following acetic acid (VIA), followed by immediate treatment of observed lesions by cryotherapy ('see and treat'). Other research studies have examined the acceptability and performance of self-sampling as a means of obtaining Pap smears, and the use of mobile clinics to increase coverage of at-risk women in rural settings. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has been used to identify high-risk women, or to help decide which women with low-grade abnormality on cytology should undergo more intensive follow-up. Prevalence of HPV in normal women in Thailand is 9-20%, but HPV testing has not been used on any systematic basis to date. Current screening programmes in Thailand are not very effective. The national cancer control programme aims to increase the coverage of screening. The population-based cancer registry will provide an effective and economical method of evaluating the impact of early diagnosis and screening at community level."
CD008054,0,17227640,0,Cervical and oral cancer screening in India.,"Incidence of both cervical and oral cancer are high in India. Although there are no organized cervical or oral screening programmes in the country, a number of research projects are ongoing or recently completed. In cervical screening, a number of studies of visual inspection with various aids and studies of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing are in progress. Long-term follow-up of these will inform policy on cervical screening in limited resource countries. A randomized trial of oral visual inspection for cancer or premalignant lesions in 192,053 subjects has been conducted in Kerala, South India. In the trial population as a whole, the study group showed a non-significant 21% reduction in mortality from oral cancer compared with the control group. In users of alcohol, tobacco or both, in which more than 90% of oral cancer deaths occurred, the reduction was a significant 34% (relative risk = 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.95). On the basis of these results, screening for oral abnormalities has the potential to prevent 37,000 deaths per year worldwide."

A total of 154 subjects with grade 1 or 2 CIN were randomly assigned either 10 mg of folic acid or a placebo daily for 6 months. Clinical status, human papillomavirus type 16 infection and blood folate levels were monitored at 2 month intervals. After 6-months no significant differences were observed between supplemented and unsupplemented subjects regarding dysplasia status, biopsy results, or prevalence of human papillomavirus type 16 infection. Folate deficiency the initiation of cervical dysplasia, but folic acid supplements do not alter the course of established disease."
CD008054,0,17701417,0,The role of chromosomal aberrations in premalignant and malignant lesions in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"The objectives of this study are to uncover the molecular mechanisms involved in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) pathogenesis by studying the chromosomal aberrations in both premalignant and malignant patients and to highlight the genotype of HNSCC in Upper Egypt. From March 2001 to December 2003, prospective study was conducted in 41 patients with precancerous, 79 patients with cancerous laryngeal, oesophageal, nasopharyngeal, nasal, and oral lesions and 50 controls in ENT department, Sohag Faculty of Medicine, Sohag, Egypt. Samples taken by punch biopsy were frozen and stored at -80 degrees C and were subjected to histopathological examination. Metaphase cells were digitally imaged and karyotyped. Karyotypes have been analysed via anatomical image capture and compared with standard human chromosome ideograms. In precancerous lesions, there were 41% 3p loss, 51% 3q gain, 29% 8q gain, and 22% 11q13 gain. In malignant lesions, there were 63% 3p13-p24 loss, 59.5% 5q12-23 loss, 49.5% 8p22-p23 loss, 45.5% 9p21-p24 loss, 40.5% 18q22-q23 loss, 66% 3q gain, 39% 8q gain, and 16% 11q13 gain. In conclusion, early diagnosis of HNSCC can be achieved by DNA extraction from suspicious lesions in high-risk groups (smokers and alcoholics) and examination of chromosomal aberrations of 3p, 3q, 8q, and 11q13. If there are high percent of chromosomal aberrations in these chromosomes, active intervention should be done (chemoprevention and regular follow-up of head and neck examination for very early detection and management)."

CD008054,0,18551620,0,Correlation of high-risk human papillomavirus genotypes persistence and risk of residual or recurrent cervical disease after surgical treatment.,"The evidence on genotype-specific risk in women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) with normal cytology and the importance of the distinction of high-risk (HR)-HPV genotypes in the management of low-grade lesions suggest that the distinction of HR-HPV genotypes has the potential to improve the follow-up of patients treated for high-grade cervical lesions. The aims of this study were to define the persistence of the different HR-HPV in the follow-up of surgical treated women, to detect the changes of genotypes from the pre- to the post-operative status, and to evaluate whether genotype-specific persistence can predict the development of residual or recurrent disease during the follow-up. HR-HPV detection and genotyping was carried out by the Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test on cervical cytological samples from 72 women treated by surgery. The 6-month post-operative HPV status was correlated with the pre-operative HPV genotype and with the residual or recurrent disease within 24 months. It was observed that the residual or recurrent disease in women with persistence of HPV 16 and/or HPV 18 was higher (82.4%) than in women with persistence of at least one HR-HPV type of group 2 (HPV 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, and 58) (66.7%) and at least one type of group 3 (HPV 39, 51, 56, 59, 68, 26, 53, 66, 73, and 82) (14.3%). These data defined HR-HPV groups for the risk of progression of disease and suggested that the identification of persistent infection with different HR-HPV genotypes has the potential to improve the management of these patients."

In 91 pregnant women we compared high-risk human papilloma virus rates in the subsequent trimesters and postpartum in comparison to 262 non-pregnant women. High-risk human papilloma virus clearance was compared with 179 high-risk human papilloma virus positive non-pregnant women. Our main questions were: (1) do high-risk human papilloma virus rates change during pregnancy?; and (2) is there any difference between high-risk human papilloma virus clearance in pregnant and non-pregnant women? Women were monitored 3-4 monthly by cytology, colposcopy, and high-risk human papilloma virus testing. The median follow-up time was 33 months (range 3-74). Non-pregnant women showed prevalence rates of high-risk human papilloma virus of 64, 57, 53, and 50%, respectively, in four subsequent 3-months periods since the start of the study. These high-risk human papilloma virus rates were higher than in the three trimesters of pregnancy, and during the first 3 months postpartum, i.e. 50, 44, 45, and 31%, respectively. Postpartum only, this difference was statistically significant (P=0.004). Paired comparisons of high-risk human papilloma virus prevalence rates of the different trimesters with the postpartum rate showed (McNemar test) decreased rates: first trimester: 18% (P=0.02), second trimester: 13% (P=0.02) and third trimester: 23% (P<0.005). Such a phenomenon was not found in non-pregnant women. Pregnant women showed a trend for increased high-risk human papilloma virus clearance during the third trimester and postpartum compared to non-pregnant women (hazard ratios 3.3 (0.8-13.7) and 4.6 (1.6-12.8), respectively). These results suggest a lowered immune-response against human papilloma virus during the first two trimesters of pregnancy with a catch-up postpartum."

CD008054,0,18329326,0,Presence of HPV DNA in convalescent salivary rinses is an adverse prognostic marker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 is present in up to 60% of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and confers a favorable prognosis in terms of recurrence and mortality. Previous reports demonstrated that HPV-16 DNA can be detected in the initial salivary rinses from these patients. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of post-treatment HPV DNA shed from the oral mucosa as a prognostic marker for persistent/recurrent head and neck cancer. Fresh tumor samples and pre- and post-treatment salivary rinses were collected from 59 patients with HNSCC. HPV-16 E6 and E7 DNA copy number in these samples were quantified by real time PCR. Twenty of 59 patients (33.9%) were HPV-16 positive in their tumors before treatment. Four of 20 HPV tumor positive patients ultimately developed recurrence, and two of these four patients were HPV-16 positive in surveillance salivary rinses (sensitivity=50%). Of the 39 (66.1%) HPV-16 negative patients on initial clinical presentation and the 16 HPV-16 positive patients who did not recur, none were HPV-16 positive in salivary rinses after treatment (specificity=100%). HPV-16 presence in follow-up salivary rinses preceded clinical detection of disease recurrence by an average of 3.5 months. Patients with presence of HPV-16 DNA in surveillance salivary rinses are at significant risk for recurrence. Quantitative measurement of salivary HPV-16 DNA has promise for surveillance and early detection of recurrence."
CD008054,0,8222248,0,Models of neoplasia and their diagnostic implications: a historical perspective.,"In comparison with normal cells, cancer cells have an enhanced ability to trap both nitrogen and energy; an enhanced operation of the glycolytic and direct oxidative pathways, leading to accumulation of lactate and increased production of NADPH; and a greater content of lysosomal hydrolases. These changes represent a reprogramming of gene expression, which, at its most specific, is accompanied by the reappearance in the cell and ultimately in the body fluids of oncodevelopmental proteins not normally found in mature adult tissues. The most florid stage of this reprogramming leads to the metastatic phenotype, which confers upon the cancer cell the ability to stimulate angiogenesis, invade the bloodstream and lymphatic vessel, and arrest and proliferate in distant tissues. The diagnostic implications of these phenotypic changes are illustrated for cancer of the cervix uteri and cancer of the colon. We also review the classical theories of neoplasia, including the cellular anoxia concept of Warburg, the deletion hypothesis of Potter, and various other mechanisms emphasizing genomic derepression and impaired immunity. The critical steps in chemical carcinogenesis are described, and the Vogelstein-Lane model is presented, emphasizing the stepwise and cumulative genomic changes affecting chromosomes 5q, 17p, 18q, and gene amplification of chromosome 12 as well as genomic instability resulting from reduced DNA methylation. The main consequences of these genomic alterations include overexpression or activation of oncogenes such as c-myc and k-ras, together with mutation or functional inactivation of suppressor genes such as p53. Finally, the implications of these findings for diagnosis and management are illustrated by reference to recent investigations in cancers of the breast, colon, and bladder, in which these genomic alterations can be detected by examination of appropriate cellular material and by detection in serum of antibodies to the p53 gene product."
CD008054,0,9815617,0,Expression of fas (CD95/APO-1) antigen induced by radiation therapy for diffuse B-cell lymphoma: immunohistochemical study.,"Most malignant lymphomas show relatively high degrees of radiosensitivity, in which apoptosis has been shown to play an important role. Recently, the Fas (CD95/APO-1)/Fas ligand system has been identified as a key regulator of apoptosis in some types of lymphoma cell lines. In this study, we aimed to determine whether Fas antigen expression is induced by radiotherapy for malignant lymphoma and to clarify its possible correlation with the therapeutic effect of radiation therapy. Fifty-six patients with tumors of the tongue, oropharynx, and maxillary sinus were examined; four were confirmed as malignant lymphoma, and the rest were identified as squamous cell carcinoma. After obtaining the patients' informed consent, biopsies were performed before treatment and at doses of 4, 10, and 20 Gy of radiotherapy, and specimens were preserved in liquid nitrogen until further examination. Serial sectioning of 6 micrometer was performed using a cryostat, and samples were immunohistochemically stained using the streptoavidin-biotin peroxidase method and a monoclonal antibody against Fas. Two of the four patients with malignant lymphoma showed Fas antigen expression on their tumor tissue at 4 and 10 Gy of radiotherapy. These tumors showed high radiosensitivity and disappeared at a dose of 20 Gy of radiotherapy. In samples from these two patients, DNA ladder formation was identified at 10 Gy. In 52 squamous cell carcinomas, staining for the Fas antigen showed negative or only slightly positive results. However, in one of the cases of squamous cell carcinoma, lymphocytes infiltrating into cancer tissue showed Fas antigen expression at 4 Gy of irradiation, and these lymphocytes disappeared on the tumor tissue at 10 Gy. Therefore, the high radiosensitivity of malignant lymphoma among our samples could be explained by the overexpression of Fas antigen induced by small doses of radiation therapy, and Fas ligand could be produced by infiltrating lymphocytes or may be expressed simultaneously on the lymphoma cells."
CD008054,0,15973782,0,Mobilization for cervical cancer screening: lessons from a poor-urban Yoruba community in Nigeria.,"Cervical cancer is a major public health problem worldwide and it remains one of the commonest malignancies in Nigeria. Screening remains the most effective tool for the detection of pre-invasive stages of cervical cancer, giving the opportunity for prompt and effective treatment before the emergence of invasive disease. In Nigeria, as in most developing countries, the concept of screening for cancer and its pre-emptive treatment is underdeveloped. The fact that the facilities and logistics for cervical cancer screening are generally located in the hospital setting, a place where one goes when ill, according to local beliefs, makes acceptance more difficult. That Nigeria urgently needs to set up or develop cervical screening programmes that will reach women outside the hospital setting in a culturally acceptable milieu is not in doubt. A community cervical screening survey for the prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and HPV infection was initiated in Idikan, a poor-urban inner core area of Ibadan. The challenges and experiences encountered in the execution of the project which could serve as useful knowledge to those undertaking similar exercises, requiring mass mobilization for cancer screening of an uninformed group, are highlighted. Our experience in the course of this study is important as it brought out the probable influences of community dynamics and social organization in illness decisions and prescriptions for health operative in this particular population group. Cervical cancer screening programmes should therefore make provisions to accommodate the occasional outcomes as we had encountered. In addition, screening programmes in developing societies would require sensitive designs that should address the cultural attitudes, personal conflicts, expectations of treatment and overall context of preventive care."

Many studies have confirmed a strong correlation between p16 immunohistochemical positivity and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) of the cervix. Because p16 is predictive of HR-HPV and HSIL, it seems plausible that p16 could be used as a diagnostic tool to triage atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) Pap smears. In this way, Pap smears with no p16 staining could be recategorized as negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) before final case disposition, thus preventing unnecessary and costly follow-up."
CD008054,0,18842994,0,Human papillomavirus mRNA and p16 detection as biomarkers for the improved diagnosis of cervical neoplasia.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the genital tract is very common and normally follows a benign clinical course; however, in an unfortunate minority of infected individuals, it can cause disease that sometimes leads to cancer. It is accepted that HPV DNA testing has a role in the management of cervical disease both in a prevaccination and postvaccination era; however, to improve the specificity of this approach, there is a requirement to develop and validate tools/assays that can identify women at risk for progressive disease. There is evidence to suggest that detection of viral gene expression both directly and indirectly may constitute a more specific approach for delineating clinically significant infection compared with HPV DNA-based assays. HPV oncogene expression and evidence of its deregulation can be monitored through direct detection of viral mRNA transcripts or through detection of the cellular protein p16. For both approaches, commercial assays have been introduced and numerous studies have been conducted. The present article describes the scientific theory underpinning these approaches, their amenability to routine-diagnostic specimens/settings, and the clinical data that has been garnered through their application thus far. Currently, there is promising data indicating that HPV mRNA and p16 might play an important role in future cervical cancer screening scenarios. Still, large randomized studies are necessary to confirm the preliminary data."
CD008054,0,20129067,0,Validation of high-risk HPV tests for primary cervical screening.,"From a clinical point of view, testing for a broad spectrum of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is only useful when a positive hrHPV test result is informative about the presence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer (CIN 2 or worse). Two hrHPV tests, i.e. HC2 and GP5+/6+, have shown in large clinical trials that they perform better in the detection of CIN 2+/CIN 3+ lesions than cytology and thus have been clinically validated. Consequently these tests are now considered as alternative screening tools for cytology in cervical screening. Candidate hrHPV tests to be used for cervical screening should have a similar balance between sensitivity and specificity for CIN 2+ lesions as these two clinically validated hrHPV tests in order to prevent redundant or excessive follow-up procedures for women with transient hrHPV infections or hrHPV-positive women without cervical lesions. The data from these large prospective clinical studies can be used to set standards for the clinical performance and characteristics of the candidate hrHPV test. To prevent costly validation trajects of candidate hrHPV tests and based on the available data from large clinical studies we demonstrate how guidelines for hrHPV test requirements and guidelines for clinical validation of candidate hrHPV tests have been developed, and how these guidelines should be used in cervical screening. It is expected that the use of these guidelines will facilitate implementation of hrHPV testing in primary cervical screening."

CD008054,0,16362994,0,HPV-mediated cervical carcinogenesis: concepts and clinical implications.,"Persistent infection with a high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is generally accepted as a necessary cause of cervical cancer. However, cervical cancer is a rare complication of an hrHPV infection since most such infections are transient, not even giving rise to cervical lesions. On average, it takes 12-15 years before a persistent hrHPV infection may ultimately, via consecutive premalignant stages (ie CIN lesions), lead to an overt cervical carcinoma. This argues that HPV-induced cervical carcinogenesis is multi-step in nature. In this review, the data from hrHPV-mediated in vitro transformation studies and those obtained from analysis of clinical specimens have been merged into a cervical cancer progression model. According to this model, a crucial decision maker in the early stages following infection involves individual susceptibility for certain HPV types depending on the genetic make-up of immune surveillance determinants. Once a CIN lesion has developed, altered transcriptional regulation of the viral E6/E7 oncogenes, resulting in genomic instability and distinguishing the process of cell transformation from a productive viral infection, probably provides the subsequent important step towards malignancy. The additional (epi)genetic alterations that subsequently accumulate in high-grade CIN lesions may result in overt malignancy via immortality and growth conditions that gradually become less sensitive to growth-modulating influences mediated by cytokines and cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. The potential implications of hrHPV testing and some other biomarkers deduced from this model for cervical screening and the clinical management of CIN disease are also discussed."

In addition, a fully funded 'catch-up' vaccination program for young women up to age 26 years has been approved for a 2-year period, from July 2007. As general practitioners (GPs) will be the main immunisation providers for this age group, in order to achieve high vaccination coverage and maximal impact on disease, it will be critical for GPs to be opportunistic in recommending this vaccine. An initial study of young Australians' attitudes towards HPV vaccination and hypothetical acceptance of the vaccine was published in this journal. We draw on this study and data published elsewhere to discuss issues of HPV vaccine acceptability, and the likely challenges of a mass vaccination initiative in this age group in Australia.

Experts agree and data support periodic cytology screening for young-adult women using one of several technologies. Recent analyses of cost-effectiveness suggest that the addition of molecular HPV DNA testing for women aged over 30 years may allow the screening interval to be lengthened to 3 years for most women. Women at high risk for HPV infection and its associated cellular atypias warrant closer monitoring and follow-up.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping was also performed. In 27.4% of women from group I, FF genotype was found, whereas this genotype was observed in 51.9% of patients in group II (p = 0.003; odds ratio = 2.856 (95% confidence interval = 1.4-5.8)). When only women infected with high-risk HPV were analyzed these differences were found to be even higher (p = 0.0013; odds ratio = 3.8 (95% confidence interval = 1.7-8.8)). FF genotype in FcGR3A gene seems to be associated with increased risk of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions to HSIL progression suggesting that its presence may play a role in HPV tolerance, persistent infection, and HSIL development."

The proportion of histopathology-verified CINII+ was similar for the two policies (395 of 1,752 women (22.5%; 95% Confidence interval [CI]: 20.6-24.6%) had CINII+ diagnosed with HPV triaging policy, 318 of 1,567 women (20.3%; 95%CI: 18.3-22.4%) had CINII+ with colposcopy policy). Sixty-four percent of women with ASCUS and 77% of women with CINI were HPV positive. HPV-positivity was age-dependent, with 81% of women below 35 years of age and 44% of women above 45 years of age testing HPV-positive. HPV triaging was cost-effective only above 35 years of age. In conclusion, a real-life randomized healthservices study of HPV triaging of women with ASCUS/CINI demonstrated similar detection of CINII+ as colposcopy of all women."
CD008054,0,11077238,0,The clinical importance of atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance on the cytologic smear.,"The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of underlying cervical and endometrial lesions among patients with atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGCUS) on the cytologic smear. Eighty-six patients with AGCUS, without evidence of squamous intraepithelial lesions, underwent coloposcopy and endocervical curettage (ECC) within 6 months of the initial finding. Endometrial samplings were performed in 25 patients. Coloposcopy, endocervical curettage, and endometrial biopsy results were reviewed. A significant lesion was defined as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and/or any structural or histologic abnormality of the cervix or uterus (i.e., polyp). Statistical analyses were performed using the t test, chi-square, and Fisher's Exact tests comparing patients with underlying lesions to those without. A significant lesion(s) was identified in 21 (24.4%) patients, with 8 (9.3%) of the lesions being high-grade cervical neoplasias. An additional 14 (16.3%) patients, with negative initial work-ups, had underlying lesions or major cytologic abnormalities diagnosed on subsequent follow-up. All of the endometrial findings were benign. None of the following were statistically significant predictors of underlying pathology: age, gravidy, parity, medications, medical history, tobacco use, history of sexually transmitted diseases including human immunodeficiency virus, previous abnormal cytologic smear, concurrent diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, or evidence of human papillomavirus. AGCUS is often associated with clinically important underlying lesions. Patients should therefore undergo colposcopy and ECC. Endometrial sampling and possible cervical conization should be performed when coloposcopic evaluation is nondiagnostic."
CD008054,0,18435450,0,Cancer risk in people infected with human immunodeficiency virus in the United States.,"Data are limited regarding cancer risk in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons with modest immunosuppression, before the onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). For some cancers, risk may be affected by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) widely available since 1996. We linked HIV/AIDS and cancer registries in Colorado, Florida and New Jersey. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) compared cancer risk in HIV-infected persons (initially AIDS-free) during the 5-year period after registration with the general population. Poisson regression was used to compare incidence across subgroups, adjusting for demographic factors. Among 57,350 HIV-infected persons registered during 1991-2002 (median CD4 count 491 cells/mm(3)), 871 cancers occurred during follow-up. Risk was elevated for Kaposi sarcoma (KS, SIR 1,300 [n = 173 cases]), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, 7.3 [n = 203]), cervical cancer (2.9 [n = 28]) and several non-AIDS-defining malignancies, including Hodgkin lymphoma (5.6 [n = 36]) and cancers of the lung (2.6 [n = 109]) and liver (2.7 [n = 14]). KS and NHL incidence declined over time but nonetheless remained elevated in 1996-2002. Incidence increased in 1996-2002 compared to 1991-1995 for Hodgkin lymphoma (relative risk 2.7, 95%CI 1.0-7.1) and liver cancer (relative risk infinite, one-sided 95%CI 1.1-infinity). Non-AIDS-defining cancers comprised 31.4% of cancers in 1991-1995, versus 58.0% in 1996-2002. For KS and NHL, risk was inversely related to CD4 count, but these associations attenuated after 1996. We conclude that KS and NHL incidence declined markedly in recent years, likely reflecting HAART-related improvements in immunity, while incidence of some non-AIDS-defining cancers increased. These trends have led to a shift in the spectrum of cancer among HIV-infected persons."

CD008054,0,12528989,0,Cancer chemoprevention drug targets.,"Cancer chemoprevention is a new approach in the management of cancer. Traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic approaches cannot cure most advanced solid malignancies. Chemoprevention can be defined as the use of non-cytotoxic drugs and natural agents to block the progression to invasive cancer. Chemoprevention can either prevent DNA damage that initiates the neoplastic transformation process or reverses the progression of pre-invasive lesions. Epidemiological observations, experimental evidence from animal carcinogenesis models, knock-out models, cancer cell lines and clinical trials have shown the efficacy of this approach. Recent advances in our understanding of carcinogenesis have led to the synthesis of new drugs that target specific receptors. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs target the prostaglandin pathway. The identification of the role of cyclooxygenase-2 in epithelial carcinogenesis led to the synthesis of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (Celecoxib). Celecoxib was subsequently approved for the prevention of colon polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis after the completion of a randomized clinical trial. The large chemoprevention clinical trial with the selective estrogen receptor modulator, tamoxifen, showed the benefit of tamoxifen in the prevention of breast cancer in high-risk women. Retinoids and rexinoids target the retinoid receptors and have a role in chemoprevention of aerodigestive, hepatic and cervical neoplasia. Selenium, an inhibitor of the glutathione peroxidase system, is being tested in the chemoprevention of prostate cancer and lung cancer. The different isoforms of vitamin E (tocopherols) may be chemopreventive. Recent evidence indicates that gamma-tocopherol may be a more powerful chemopreventive than the alpha-tocopherol. The review details the rationale, experimental and clinical evidence and the drug targets of the chemopreventive agents that are currently in various phases of clinical development."

CD008054,0,7583467,0,[Role of cancer registries].,"The first Cancer Registries were created in 1975 in France. Their ulterior development and their scientific production have been furthered by the apparition from 1986 under the aegis of the Health Ministry and of the INSERM, of a National Population Registry Committee. Cancer Registries have seriously contributed to a better knowledge of the cancer problem in our country and to describe the french specificities, in particular the importance of the mouth and pharynx cancers. They insure both a monitoring and an alert role; they also contribute to the medical supervision of the Chernobyl accident effects. French registries play a very active role concerning clinical research. They participate to many European studies of health care evaluation. In other respects, many etiological studies have been realized about professional risks of cancer, risks linked with nutritional habits, and on the etiologic role of the Tamoxifen. Finally, certain registries have created DNA banks. If nowadays their role in health planning remains modest, they very actively contribute in evaluating screening actions of breast, cervix and large bowel cancers. They also attracted the attention of Health Authorities on the cervix cancer screening's incoherencies. They evaluate the pilot project of the breast cancer and the registry of the CÃ´te d'Or country evaluates the efficacity of a randomized colo rectal mass screening study. The main difficulties met by the registries are linked with the development of laws protecting more and more the individual freedoms, making it harder and harder the registration exhaustive character."
CD008054,0,9600817,0,Detection of human papillomavirus type 16 E6/E7 oncogene transcripts in dysplastic and nondysplastic cervical scrapes by nested RT-PCR.,"Infections with high-risk human papillomaviruses (e.g., HPV-16) play an important role in the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cervical cancer (IC). Continued expression of the viral E6 and E7 genes is believed to be a key factor for oncogenic transformation of infected cells. Two spliced transcripts of the E6/E7 oncogenes, termed E6*I and E6*II, can be detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). To increase the sensitivity of detecting E6/E7 transcripts in cervical scrapes we took advantage of a nested RT-PCR (nRT-PCR) protocol. In a series of 30 HPV-16-positive patients with histologic diagnoses ranging from nondysplastic epithelium to IC, the application of nRT-PCR significantly improved the detection of E6/E7 transcripts compared to conventional RT-PCR. The prevalence of E6/E7 spliced transcripts correlated with lesion severity and the nRT-PCR protocol allowed detection of these transcripts even in nondysplastic epithelium and CIN I lesions. Therefore, in epidemiologic follow-up studies, detection of E6/E7 transcripts by nRT-PCR should prove to be a useful diagnostic tool for risk evaluations regarding the development of CIN and its progression to cervical cancer, especially in high-risk HPV-type-infected patients with CIN 0 and CIN I."

We compared the performance characteristics of Inform HPV (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) and Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Digene, Gaithersburg, MD) using SurePath for collection. The study included samples from 102 women, aged 18 to 60 years, who underwent a SurePath Pap test immediately before colposcopy and cervical biopsy. Each SurePath specimen was processed additionally for Inform HPV and HC2. Performance characteristics were determined by using the cervical biopsy as the ""gold standard."" The SurePath, Inform HPV, and HC2 correctly identified high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) in 15 (94%) of 16, 6 (38%) of 16, and 14 (93%) of 15 cases, respectively. When only SurePath samples with a diagnosis of atypical glandular and/or squamous cells were examined, Inform HPV and HC2 correctly identified HSIL in 19 (43%) of 44 and 45 (100%) of 45 cases, respectively. When SurePath is used for collection, Inform HPV lacks sufficient sensitivity to detect HSIL reliably."

We have analysed 179 low-grade cervical squamous intra-epithelial lesions (SILs) and 15 normal cervices for the presence of HPV using both in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was performed with GP5+/GP6+ primers followed by hybridization using probes for low (HPV 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44), intermediate (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 51, 52, 58, 59, 66 and 68) and high-risk HPVs (HPV 16, 18, 45 and 56). Interphase cytogenetic analysis using pericentromeric probes for chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 17, 18 and X was also performed to identify numerical chromosomal abnormalities. Tetrasomy of all nine chromosomes was identified within basal keratinocytes, was restricted to epithelia infected with high risk (17 of 46) or intermediate risk (23 of 83) HPVs but was not HPV type-specific. Tetrasomy was not identified in any of the epithelia infected with low risk HPVs (n = 62). These numbers include multiple infection. These findings indicate that the induction of tetrasomy is a property restricted to high and intermediate-risk HPV types but that it is not type-specific. The factors governing which lesions will develop this abnormality are as yet unclear."

Therefore un-certainties arise both for gynecologists and their patients with a view to the ensuring control- and therapy management respectively. In order to clarify the question, whether an additional immunocytochemical examination using p16 (INK4a) can improve the prognostic statement for patients with cytological diagnosis of group III D, the cytological diagnosis, the HPV test results and the results of the CINtec (TM) p16 (INK4a)-Immunocytochemistry in 357 patients were being drawn up parallel or documented. In the case of 115 patients with actual cytological diagnosis group III D a validation could be performed after histological (56) and cytological (59) follow up respectively. In 63.5 % of these III D-patients p16 was graded immunocytochemically positive, in 73.9 % high risk HPV (HC II) was positive. In relation to the entire follow up cytological diagnosis, high risk HPV und p16 detection have a positive predictive value of 53, 65.5 and 82.4 % at the time of evaluation. The negative predictive values are 80.6 % for high risk HPV and 100 % for p16 respectively. In spite of some methodical restrictions and an uncertain predictive statement concerning the graduation of CIN during the histological clarification in the follow up, the use of p16 (INK4a)-Immunocytochemistry can distinctly improve the prognostic statement in routine procedure for patients with cytological diagnosis of group III D."

Assuming 70% coverage, HPV 16, 18 vaccination of adolescent girls is expected to reduce the lifetime risk of cancer by approximately 42.7% (range, 33.2-53.5%); screening three times per lifetime is expected to reduce risk by 21.9-30.7% depending on the screening test, and a combined approach of vaccination and screening is expected to reduce cancer risk by a mean of 60.8% (range, 52.8-70.1%). In Brazil; provided the cost per vaccinated woman is less than I$ 25, implying a per dose cost of approximately I$ 5, vaccination before age 12, followed by screening three times per lifetime between ages 35 and 45, would be considered very cost-effective using the country's per capita gross domestic product as a cost-effectiveness threshold. Assuming a coverage rate of 70%, this strategy would be expected to prevent approximately 100,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer over a 5-year period. Vaccination strategies identified as cost-effective may be unaffordable in countries with similar socioeconomic profiles as Brazil without assistance; these results can provide guidance to the global community by identifying health investments of highest priority and with the greatest promise."

As is shown in a meta-analysis by Koshiol et al. (Am J Epidemiol 2008;168:123-137), detection of carcinogenic HPV viral persistence could be used to identify women at the greatest risk of cervical precancer. Specifically, women who have carcinogenic HPV infection that persists for at least 1 year versus those whose infections clear are at significantly elevated risk of having or developing cervical precancer. However, before detection of HPV persistence can be used in cervical cancer screening, several considerations need to be addressed: 1) validation and Food and Drug Administration approval of a reliable HPV genotyping test, 2) rational clinical algorithms based on risk of precancer and cancer for the clinical management of HPV persistence, 3) clinician and patient acceptability of monitoring of HPV infections (including not responding excessively to the first positive HPV test and waiting 1-2 years for infections to either persist or resolve), and 4) patient compliance with recommended follow-up. Investigators will need to address these and other key issues in order to realize the potential utility of HPV viral monitoring for improving the accuracy of cervical cancer screening."

Data from the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS)/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study (ALTS) now provide level I clinical evidence from a large, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial that reflex human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing of ASCUS cases is generally the preferred method for initial assessment of the most prevalent category of abnormal Pap interpretation. The proposed combination of HPV DNA testing with cytologic Pap testing, the DNA Pap test, further shows the potential to nearly eliminate false-negative screening results, based on sensitivity and negative predictive values reported in available studies.

An initial sequence analysis of HPV-16 long control, E6 and E7 regions of 53 well-defined cervical samples containing HPV-16 revealed that a T to G transition at nucleotide position 350 within the E6 open reading frame was the most common variation, the frequency of which seemed to decrease with increasing severity of the lesion. Therefore, a total of 246 cervical samples of residents of The Netherlands was specifically analysed for HPV-16 350G/T variants and/or p53 codon 72 genotypes. These comprised HPV-negative normal cervical scrapes (n=40), normal cervical scrapes containing HPV-16 (n=46), scrapes containing HPV-16 from women with abnormal cervical cytology participating in a non-intervention follow-up study without (n=38) and with (n=51) a histologically proven cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III lesion at the end of the study, and cervical squamous cell carcinomas (n=71). Neither specific HPV-16 350G/T variants nor specific p53 genotypes were associated with a higher risk of developing CIN III or cervical cancer. However, HPV-16 350T variants were significantly over-represented in p53 Arg homozygous women with cervical cancer.

A 41-year-old Tunisian woman was admitted to our department with newly diagnosed hyperglycemia. She had a history of bilateral urinary stone recurrence, managed successfully on two occasions. On physical examination a thyroid node of 1cm on the left side was found. Laboratory evaluation and imaging findings confirmed the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. During cervicotomy, the parathyroid adenoma was resected and the thyroid node was suspected to be a carcinoma. Total thyroidectomy, with appropriate neck nodal resection, was performed. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma and revealed a multifocal and bilateral medullary carcinoma. These findings led to the diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia. DNA-analysis demonstrated a germline Cys634Arg mutation in the RET-protooncogene.

CD008054,0,1593881,0,Melanoma of the external ear.,"Management of melanoma of the external ear is controversial. Thirty-one patients treated for this disease were identified at our institution between January 1, 1974 and December 31, 1989. Follow-up was an average of 7.12 years (range 1-15). Local therapy performed included 16 wedge resections, 3 split thickness skin grafts after excision to the perichondrium, 10 partial and 2 total amputations. There were two local recurrences, four metachronous cervical metastases, and four distant metastases. Three elective and five therapeutic neck dissections were performed. Survivors at 1, 5, and 10 years were 93, 77, and 47%, respectively. There was no relationship between DNA ploidy, local surgical therapy, and eventual recurrence. Clinical stage and tumor thickness demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with likelihood of recurrence (P = .02 and .05). There is no evidence that melanoma of the ear has a poorer prognosis or different prognostic factors than melanoma at other cutaneous sites. In selected cases, local disease can be controlled by excision and skin graft rather than the more aggressive current procedures."

HPV is associated with 500,000 new cases of cervical cancer and 250,000 cervical cancer deaths worldwide each year. Oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for a majority of cervical cancers and can also cause low- and high-grade cervical lesions (CIN 1, 2, 3) as well as high-grade vulvar or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN or VaIN 2/3). Nononcogenic types HPV 6 and 11 also contribute to the overall burden of HPV disease, giving rise to CIN 1, anogenital warts, cutaneous lesions, and respiratory papillomatosis."

CD008054,0,20506504,0,The accuracy of colposcopic biopsy: analyses from the placebo arm of the Gardasil clinical trials.,"We evaluated the overall agreement between colposcopically directed biopsies and the definitive excisional specimens within the context of three clinical trials. A total of 737 women aged 16-45 who had a cervical biopsy taken within 6 months before their definitive therapy were included. Per-protocol, colposcopists were to also obtain a representative cervical biopsy immediately before definitive therapy. Using adjudicated histological diagnoses, the initial biopsies and the same day biopsies were correlated with the surgically excised specimens. The overall agreement between the biopsies taken within 6 months of definitive therapy, and the definitive therapy diagnoses was 42% (weighted kappa = 0.34) (95% CI: 0.29-0.39). The overall underestimation of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 or adenocarcinoma in situ (CIN2-3/AIS) and CIN3/AIS was 26 and 42%, respectively. When allowing for one degree of variance in the correlation, the overall agreement was 92% for CIN2-3/AIS. The overall agreement between the same day biopsy and definitive therapy specimen was 56% (weighted kappa = 0.41) (95% CI: 0.36-0.47), and the underestimation of CIN2-3/AIS was 57%. There were significant associations in the agreement between biopsies and excisional specimen diagnoses when patients were stratified by age, number of biopsies, lesion size, presence of human papillomavirus (HPV)16/18 and region. Of 178 diagnostic endocervical curettages performed, 14 (7.9%) found any HPV disease. Colposcopic accuracy improved when CIN2 and CIN3/AIS were grouped as a single predictive measure of high-grade disease. Colposcopy functioned well when allowed a one-degree difference between the biopsy and the surgical histologic interpretations, as done in clinical practice. Taking more than one biopsy improved colposcopic accuracy and could improve patient management."

CD008054,0,18618504,0,Contribution of DNA ploidy image cytometry to the management of ASC cervical lesions.,The Bethesda system classifies smears that suggest an underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) as ASC (atypical squamous cell) smears. ASC smears are subdivided into ASCUS (of undetermined significance) and ASCH (cannot exclude a high-grade lesion).

When squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is diagnosed, proper management and improved prognosis depends on identification of the primary tumor. Recent studies have indicated that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is associated closely with oropharyngeal SCC and that these tumors have a distinct nonkeratinizing morphology.

CD008054,0,20112339,0,The health and economic effects of HPV DNA screening in The Netherlands.,"We studied the health and economic effects of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing in cervical screening using a simulation model. The key data source was a Dutch longitudinal screening trial. We compared cytological testing with repeat cytology (for borderline/mildly abnormal smears) to HPV testing with cytology triage (for HPV-positive smears), combination testing (combined HPV and cytology) and cytological testing with HPV triage (for borderline/mildly abnormal smears). We varied the screening interval from 5 to 10 years. The main outcome measures were the number of cervical cancer cases, the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The base-case estimates were accompanied with ranges across 118 calibrated parameter settings (calibration criteria: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3, cancer and mortality rates). In comparison to 5-yearly cytology, 5-yearly HPV testing with cytology triage gave a reduction in the number of cancer cases of 23% (range, 9-27%). The reduction was 26% (range, 10-29%) for combination testing and 3% (range, -1 to 8%) for cytology with HPV triage. For strategies with primary HPV testing, the model also estimated a reduction in cancer cases when the screening interval was extended to 7.5 years. Five-yearly cytology with HPV triage and 5 to 7.5-yearly HPV testing with cytology triage were cost effective for the base-case settings and the majority of calibrated parameter settings (ICER below Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20,000/QALY). Our model indicates that HPV testing with cytology triage is likely to be cost effective. An extension of the screening interval may be considered to control costs."

CD008054,0,10606179,0,Immunophenotype of mutant ras p21 and early response to radiotherapy in cancer of the uterine cervix.,"Previous studies have postulated that ras gene mutations may influence cellular response to radiotherapy. However, clinical studies have often been limited by the cumbersome methodology associated with DNA analysis. The availability of ELISA method has eventually made clinical evaluation of ras gene mutation feasible. In this study ras mutation by in vitro identification of four mutant forms of p21 ras in cervical tumor tissue extracts was analyzed. Mutant ras proteins were evaluated by an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Expression of ras p21 mutations was studied in 101 patients, and a correlation between pre-treatment experimental analyses and the clinical status of the patient after radiotherapy (up to 16 months follow up) was established. There was no correlation between the presence of Val 12 p21 and tumor response to radiotherapy. Yet, presence of the other three mutant proteins had significant relationship to treatment outcome. Detection of Arg 12 mutation was more common in patients who either had residual disease or developed recurrences (28%) as compared to those remaining disease-free (1.5%). The presence of the Arg 12 mutation therefore correlated to poor prognosis (r = 0.445, p = 0.0000). Similarly, the Asp 12 mutation was also more common in patients with residual/recurrent disease (25%) as compared to patients remaining disease-free (3%). Asp 12 mutation also showed a correlation to treatment outcome (r = 0.337, p = 0.00057). Asp 13 mutation was more frequent in patients with residual or recurrent disease (28%) as compared to those remaining disease-free (4.6%). On the basis of laboratory evidence ras genes appear to be involved as modulators of tumor response to radiation therapy. This understanding of the involvement of specific genes in radioresistance will result in the improvement of potential therapies that can be targeted at specific genes, through approaches such as selective inhibition by anti-sense oligonucleotides."

CD008054,0,17439841,0,The relationship of community biopsy-diagnosed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 to the quality control pathology-reviewed diagnoses: an ALTS report.,"We examined the predictors (cytologic interpretations, pathology review, human papillomavirus [HPV] testing results, and colposcopic impressions) of precancer among 545 women with clinical center biopsy diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 in the ASCUS LSIL Triage Study. Among women with a CIN 2 biopsy result, there was an increasing likelihood that the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) tissue sample was diagnosed as precancer (CIN 3) with an increasing number of clinical risk factors of cervical precancer (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL] cytology, high-grade colposcopy, detection of HPV type 16; Ptrend < .0005). In a multivariate model, using a case definition of worst histologic diagnosis made by the quality control pathology review of biopsy and LEEP tissue samples, HPV-16 was positively associated (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-8.8) with a CIN 3 diagnosis, whereas testing negative for HPV or positive for noncarcinogenic HPV types was negatively associated (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.14-0.75) with a CIN 3 diagnosis. Although we found clear evidence that HPV-16 detection helped clarify whether a biopsy specimen diagnosed as CIN 2 represented HPV infection or cervical precancer, this relationship was not sufficiently robust to be clinically useful for reducing the overtreatment of women with HPV infection."
CD008054,0,21263978,0,Colposcopy.,"Colposcopy was introduced to Canadian medical practice in the late 1960s and its use has only recently become widespread. Until the advent of colposcopy, most women with abnormal Pap smears had a cone biopsy of the cervix with all its attendant problems. The colposcope has completely changed the management of an abnormal Pap smear with respect to diagnosis and has had a remarkable influence on treatment. Cryosurgery and carbon dioxide laser surgery were introduced as out-patient treatments for precursors of cervical cancer because by using colposcopy the physician is able to accurately diagnose cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Colposcopy has also been an important tool in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of human papillomavirus infections in men and women."
CD008054,0,20473898,0,Prospective study of human papillomavirus and risk of cervical adenocarcinoma.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are established as a major cause of cervical carcinoma. However, causality inference is dependent on prospective evidence showing that exposure predicts risk for future disease. Such evidence is available for squamous cell carcinoma, but not for cervical adenocarcinoma. We followed a population-based cohort of 994,120 women who participated in cytological screening in Sweden for a median of 6.7 years. Baseline smears from women who developed adenocarcinoma during follow-up (118 women with in situ disease and 164 with invasive disease) and their individually matched controls (1,434 smears) were analyzed for HPV using PCR. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) of future adenocarcinoma with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Being positive for HPV 16 in the first cytologically normal smear was associated with increased risks for both future adenocarcinoma in situ (OR: 11.0, 95% CI: 2.6-46.8) and invasive adenocarcinoma (OR: 16.0, 95% CI: 3.8-66.7), compared to being negative for HPV 16. Similarly, an HPV 18 positive smear was associated with increased risks for adenocarcinoma in situ (OR: 26.0, 95% CI: 3.5-192) and invasive adenocarcinoma (OR: 28.0, 95% CI: 3.8-206), compared to an HPV 18 negative smear. Being positive for HPV 16/18 in 2 subsequent smears was associated with an infinite risk of both in situ and invasive adenocarcinoma. In conclusion, infections with HPV 16 and 18 are detectable up to at least 14 years before diagnosis of cervical adenocarcinoma. Our data provide prospective evidence that the association of HPV 16/18 with cervical adenocarcinoma is strong and causal."

CD008054,0,1304100,0,[Inverted papilloma of the nose and paranasal sinuses. Retrospective study of 18 cases].,"The authors report about 18 cases of inverted papillomas treated between 1981 and 1991. The average age of the patients is 51 years, with a marked male predominance. The average follow-up is of 4 years. The most often noted revealing sign is unilateral nasal obstruction. A history of polypectomy and nasosinual surgery is found in 45% of the cases in our series. The treatment was surgical in all cases, including 4 De Lima's procedures, 11 procedures through a paralateronasal approach, 2 ethmoidectomies through an endonasal approach, and 1 degloving for a septal lesion. Endonasal surgery was performed for two limited tumors, for which the diagnosis of inverted papilloma never could be made preoperatively. The recurrence rate observed in our series is 5%. Out of 18 patients, 4 presented with a malignant change, either at once (2 cases) or some time after the primary exeresis of the inverted papilloma (2 cases). In the light of the results, and after analyzing the literature, the authors reassert the necessity of radical exeresis for inverted papilloma. Rhinosinual endoscopy must remain a diagnostic means and never is an indication of exeresis of inverted papilloma. The authors emphasize the difficulty of the histological diagnosis and set forth the various problems arising from the malignant degeneration of inverted papillomas. Recent discoveries on viral etiopathogenesis and on the oncogenic potential of the type-16 papilloma virus may allow characterizing the evolutive and prognostic features of inverted papillomas in the future."
CD008054,0,17583755,0,Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adducts in cervix of women infected with carcinogenic human papillomavirus types: an immunohistochemistry study.,"Among women infected with carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV), there is a two- to five-fold increased risk of cervical precancer and cancer in women who smoke compared to those who do not smoke. Because tobacco smoke contains carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), it was of interest to examine human cervical tissue for PAH-DNA adduct formation. Here, we measured PAH-DNA adduct formation in cervical biopsies collected in follow-up among women who tested positive for carcinogenic HPV at baseline. A semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) method using antiserum elicited against DNA modified with r7,t8-dihydroxy-t-9,10-oxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BPDE) was used to measure nuclear PAH-DNA adduct formation. Cultured human cervical keratinocytes exposed to 0, 0.153, or 0.331microM BPDE showed dose-dependent increases in r7,t8,t9-trihydroxy-c-10-(N(2)deoxyguanosyl)-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-benzo[a]pyrene (BPdG) adducts. For BPdG adduct analysis, paraffin-embedded keratinocytes were stained by IHC with analysis of nuclear color intensity by Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) and, in parallel cultures, extracted DNA was assayed by quantitative BPDE-DNA chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA). For paraffin-embedded samples from carcinogenic HPV-infected women, normal-appearing cervical squamous epithelium suitable for scoring was found in samples from 75 of the 114 individuals, including 29 cases of cervical precancer or cancer and 46 controls. With a lower limit of detection of 20 adducts/10(8) nucleotides, detectable PAH-DNA adduct values ranged from 25 to 191/10(8) nucleotides, with a median of 75/10(8) nucleotides. PAH-DNA adduct values above 150/10(8) nucleotides were found in eight samples, and in three samples adducts were non-detectable. There was no correlation between PAH-DNA adduct formation and either smoking or case status. Therefore, PAH-DNA adduct formation as measured by this methodology did not appear related to the increased risk of cervical precancer and cancer among carcinogenic HPV-infected smokers."
CD008054,0,19464729,0,Age-appropriate use of human papillomavirus vaccines in the U.S.,"Cervical infections by approximately 15 cancer-associated (carcinogenic) human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes cause virtually all cervical cancer and its immediate precursor lesions worldwide. Prophylactic vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) types HPV16 and HP18, which cause 70% of cervical cancer worldwide, hold great promise for reducing the burden of cervical cancer worldwide. However, current HPV vaccines prevent future infections and related cervical abnormalities and do not treat pre-existing HPV infections. In the U.S., HPV vaccine introduction should be considered in the context of a very successful cervical cancer screening program that has reduced the rates of cervical cancer by 75% or more. Thus, HPV vaccines will only prevent an incremental number of additional cervical cancers in the U.S. The introduction of HPV vaccines can also prevent other HPV-related sequelae, most importantly cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN2/3), which precede the development of cervical cancer and require clinical follow-up and treatment. Examining data from 7 clinical centers in the U.S., the median age of CIN2/3 is typically between 25 and 30 years of age in 2007; if screen-detected CIN2/3 develops on average 5-10 years after the causal infection is acquired, HPV vaccination will only prevent a significant proportion of CIN2/3 if it is given to women before the age of 26 and more so if given to women 18 and younger. It is increasingly evident that prophylactic HPV vaccines will provide the greatest public health or population benefit only when delivered to adolescent, mostly HPV-naive women."

CD008054,0,20949622,0,Unique variants of human papillomavirus genotypes 52 and 58 and risk of cervical neoplasia.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) 52 and 58 are oncogenic HPV types prevalent in Asia. Our study aims to explore intratypic variants of HPV 52 and 58 in Taiwan. A total of 11,923 women were enrolled from seven townships in 1991-1992. HPV DNA in their cervical cells was detected and typed by EasyChipÂ® HPV blot. Among 424 participants infected with HPV 52 and/or 58, nucleotide variations were determined in cervical cell samples of 406 participants by the polymerase chain reaction sequencing of the long control region, E6 and E7 genes. Nonprototype-like variants including lineages B and C were detected in 278 (99.3%) of 280 HPV 52 samples. The prototype and prototype-like group (lineage A) of HPV58 was found in 132 (98.5%) of 134 HPV 58 samples, with sublineage A1, A2 and A3 variant in 14.2, 27.6 and 56.7%, respectively. Among women infected with single HPV 52 type, the C variant (vs. B variant) was associated with an increased prevalence of cytologically diagnosed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse lesions showing an age-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval, CI) of 5.2 (1.0-27.6) and an increased prevalence of histologically confirmed high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or more severe lesions with an age-adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of 7.6 (1.3-43.8). It was concluded that frequency distributions of HPV 52 and 58 variants in Taiwan were different from those in European and American populations. The association between C variant of HPV 52 and prevalence of cervical neoplasia needs further validation."
CD008054,0,20949623,0,Adenocarcinoma in situ and associated human papillomavirus type distribution observed in two clinical trials of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine.,"The primary objective of this report is to describe the detection of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and associated human papillomavirus (HPV) type distribution that was observed in the context of two phase 3 clinical trials of a quadrivalent HPV6/11/16/18 vaccine. In this intention-to-treat analysis, we include all women who had at least one follow-up visit postenrollment. Healthy women (17,622) aged 15-26 with no history of HPV disease and a lifetime number of less than five sex partners (average follow-up of 3.6 years) were randomized (1:1) to receive vaccine or placebo at day 1, months 2, and 6. Women underwent colposcopy and biopsy according to a Papanicolaou triage algorithm. All tissue specimens were tested for 14 HPV types and were adjudicated by a pathology panel. During the trials, 22 women were diagnosed with AIS (six vaccine and 16 placebo). There were 25 AIS lesions in total, with HPV16/18 present in 96% (24 of 25 with 15 of 25 as single infections). Only two of 22 women had concomitant cytology results suggesting glandular abnormality. Colposcopic impressions (25 total) were either negative or indicated squamous lesions only. Of women with AIS, all six in the vaccine cohort and seven of 16 in the placebo cohort were infected at baseline with the same HPV type that was detected in the AIS lesion. Concurrent squamous lesions were detected in 20 of these 22 women. In summary, our findings show that AIS evades colposcopic and cervical cytologic detection. As most AIS lesions were HPV16/18-related, prophylactic HPV vaccination should reduce the incidence of invasive adenocarcinoma."

CD008054,0,16950022,0,Chapter 10: New dimensions in cervical cancer screening.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has clearly demonstrated a higher sensitivity but somewhat lower specificity than cytology. However, there are still issues regarding how best to use it in primary screening. In countries where cytology is of good quality, the most interesting possibility for primary screening is to use HPV testing as the sole screening modality with cytology reserved for triage of HPV-positive women. In countries with a less established infrastructure, however, use of HPV alone would also be attractive, although rapid, simple tests followed by immediate treatment are needed to minimize the number of visits and make best use of limited resources. Several approaches to deal with the lower specificity of HPV testing are also examined. These include HPV typing with a different management strategy for HPV-16 and -18/45, use of viral load to exclude infections unlikely to be associated with > or =CIN-2, and markers of proliferative lesions such as p16 and mRNA or cell-cycle markers such as cdc6 or the mcm5 proteins. Micro-array studies offer the prospect of discovering new, better DNA- or RNA-based diagnostics. The fact that HPV is a sexually transmitted infection may lead to anxiety and concerns about sexual relationships and these issues are also discussed. Ongoing HPV studies are identified and briefly reviewed."
CD008054,0,19003961,0,High-risk human papillomavirus DNA load in a population-based cervical screening cohort in relation to the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer.,"In a population-based cervical screening cohort, we determined the value of type-specific viral load assessment for the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer (>or=CIN2). Viral load was determined by type-specific real-time PCR in women with single HPV16,-18,-31 and -33 infections, as determined by GP5+/6+-PCR. Study endpoints were the detection of cumulative >or=CIN2 or>or=CIN3 within 18 months of follow-up. High viral loads of HPV16,-31, and -33 were predictive for >or=CIN2 (relative risk of 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3-1.9), 1.7 (95% CI: 1.1-2.7) and 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1-3.1) per 10-fold change in viral load, respectively). For HPV18, the relative risk was of similar magnitude (1.5, 95% CI: 0.7-3.1), though not significant (p=0.3). Subsequently, we determined the sensitivities of viral load for >or=CIN2 and >or=CIN3 in HPV DNA-positive women using viral load thresholds previously defined in a cross-sectional study. These thresholds were based on the 25th, 33rd and 50th percentiles of type-specific HPV16,-18,-31 or -33 viral load values found in women with normal cytology. For all types, combined sensitivities for >or=CIN2 were 93.5%, 88.8% and 77.7% for the 25th, 33rd and 50th percentile thresholds, respectively. Response-operator-characteristics (ROC) curve analysis showed that viral load testing on HPV DNA-positive women in addition to or instead of cytology may result in an increased sensitivity for >or=CIN2, but at the cost of a marked decrease in specificity in relation to cytology. Similar results were obtained when using >or=CIN3 as endpoint. In conclusion, in a cervical screening setting viral load assessment of HPV16, 18, 31 and 33 has no additive value to stratify high-risk HPV GP5+/6+-PCR-positive women for risk of >or=CIN2 or>or=CIN3."

Several recent epidemiological studies have confirmed that combined oral contraceptives (COCs) provide substantial protection against endometrial and ovarian cancer, and this protection is long-lasting and may persist for 15 or more years after termination of OC use. In many studies COCs have been associated with an increased risk of cervical abnormalities and cervical cancer, but there might be alternative explanations for these epidemiological associations (COC users can start having sexual intercourse at an earlier age, they have more sexual partners, and they rarely use barrier methods of contraception), so OCs act as a promoter for HPV-induced carcinogenesis. Finally, women who are currently using COCs or have used them in the past 10 years are at a slightly increased risk of having breast cancer during the next 10 years, although the additional cancers diagnosed tend to be localized to the breast and they are less advanced clinically than the cancers diagnosed in those who have never used COCs."

Viral and nonviral determinants of HPV acquisition and clearance were examined among 972 sexually active women, ages 18 to 85 years, recruited from clinics on Oahu, Hawaii, and followed for a mean duration of 15 months (range, 2-56 months). Interviews and cervical cell specimens for cytology and HPV DNA detection by PCR, using the PGMY09/PGMY11 primer system, were obtained at baseline and at 4-month intervals. The prevalence of cervical HPV infection was 25.6% at study entry. A total of 476 incident genotype-specific infections were observed during the follow-up period. The incidence of high-risk (HR) HPV types (9.26 per 1,000 woman-months) was similar to low-risk (LR) HPV types (8.24 per 1,000 woman-months). The most commonly acquired HR-HPV types were HPV-52, HPV-16, and HPV-31; and their incidence was increased significantly with a coexisting cervical HPV infection. Cervical HPV acquisition decreased with age, income, and long-term use of oral contraceptives and increased with number of sexual partners, use of hormonal creams, alcohol drinking, and condom use by a sexual partner. Cohort participants cleared 265 of the 476 incident infections during follow-up. LR-HPV infections cleared more rapidly than did HR-HPV infections (median, 180 days versus 224 days). Clearance times were enhanced among older women and women with multiple infections. Our data suggest several viral and nonviral determinants of cervical HPV acquisition and clearance that might be used in cervical cancer prevention programs."

Patients with sporadic MTC usually undergo total thyroidectomy because of a possible hereditary or bilateral process. We evaluated the usefulness of germline RET oncogene mutation analysis in surgery for apparently sporadic MTC and performed unilateral surgery on patients without detectable mutation. In 36 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of apparently sporadic MTC, we performed germline RET oncogene mutation analyses: before surgery in 8 recent patients and after surgery in 28 who had been treated before 1996. Of the latter, 5 had bilateral MTC. DNA samples were extracted from their peripheral blood, and the polymerase chain reaction products of the RET proto-oncogene were analyzed using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and the direct sequencing methods. Before 1996 we often performed total thyroidectomy but changed to hemithyroidectomy thereafter, except in one patient with associated Graves' ophthalmopathy. Our minimal standard practice included systematic central and ipsilateral neck dissection. The outcome was assessed in terms of gastrin- and calcium-stimulated plasma calcitonin levels. Germline RET mutations were found in six patients. Five of these patients had bilateral MTC, whereas all 30 patients without mutation had unilateral disease. Hemithyroidectomy in seven of our recent patients resulted in normalization of plasma calcitonin levels in all, although four were found to have microscopic lymph node involvement. In conclusion, hemithyroidectomy with systematic central and ipsilateral neck dissection is an appropriate procedure for patients with sporadic MTC without detectable germline RET mutations."

Hence, the health sector has looked to sexual and reproductive health programmes for leadership and guidance in providing information and counselling to prevent these forms of transmission, and more recently to undertake some aspects of treatment. This paper reviews and assesses the contributions made to date by sexual and reproductive health services to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, mainly by services for family planning, sexually transmitted infections and antenatal and delivery care. It also describes other sexual and reproductive health problems experienced by HIV-positive women, such as the need for abortion services, infertility services and cervical cancer screening and treatment. This paper shows that sexual and reproductive health programmes can make an important contribution to HIV prevention and treatment, and that STI control is important both for sexual and reproductive health and HIV/AIDS control. It concludes that more integrated programmes of sexual and reproductive health care and STI/HIV/AIDS control should be developed which jointly offer certain services, expand outreach to new population groups, and create well-functioning referral links to optimize the outreach and impact of what are to date essentially vertical programmes."

In addition, we also examined the biological significance of protooncogene expression and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in the initiation and promotion of dysplasia. Among 540 cases of dysplasia we have managed, 48.8% of the cases of mild, moderate and severe dysplasia which we followed up for more than 6 months regressed, and 24.1% of the cases progressed. The cure rate for laser therapy based on the follow up for 6 to 96 months was significantly high (97.9%) in 342 cases treated by the cone method, and low (89.5%) in 38 cases treated by the vaporization method. Preoperative histological findings confirmed 60.5% of postoperative findings, and several early cervical carcinomas were found in preoperative cases of dysplasia by laser conization. Among 28 cases (8.2%) of incomplete excision, 24 cases (85.7%) regressed spontaneously. On the other hand, the positive rate of immunostaining of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) and c-myc oncogene product (c-myc protein) increased from mild or moderate to severe dysplasia, and the positive rate for EGF-R was significantly high (80.0%) in the progressive group. The positive rate for HPV genome was quite low (16.0%) in dysplasia. Among them, EGF-R was most associated with the prognosis of dysplasia. These results suggest that laser conization should be performed for many cases of dysplasia because of the preoperative possibility of the existence of early cancer, and EGF-R is also useful in determining the necessity for therapy for dysplasia."

Serum samples taken at the date of diagnosis were HPV DNA positive in 45% of all investigated samples. Sera which were HPV DNA positive at the time of diagnosis became and also remained negative after primary treatment in patients without recurrence or persistent disease. HPV DNA was positive up to 423 days before the time of clinical diagnosis of recurrence in 10 out of 13 cases (median 72 days, range 0-423 days). Serum HPV DNA seems to reflect biological activity of the tumor. Our results indicate that serum HPV DNA might be a useful additional marker for early detection of recurrence in cervical cancer patients."

CD008054,0,1349360,0,Relationship of human papillomavirus type to grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"OBJECTIVE--To determine the relationship of human papillomavirus (HPV) type to grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in a large series of cases. DESIGN--A survey of HPV types in CIN lesions detected using a new, highly accurate method for typing HPV that is based on restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of amplimers produced during polymerase chain amplification of the conserved L1 region of HPV using consensus primers. SETTING--Private gynecologists' offices and inner-city colposcopy clinics. PATIENTS--A convenience sample of 276 HPV DNA-positive cervical biopsy specimens or samples from patients undergoing colposcopy for abnormal Papanicolaou smears. INTERVENTION--None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)--Human papillomavirus type(s). RESULTS--Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 lesions were relatively heterogeneous with regard to associated HPV types. Nineteen percent of CIN 1 lesions were associated with HPV types 6 or 11; 29% contained HPV types 16, 18, or 33; and 19% were associated with ""novel types"" of HPV. It was also found that 22% of CIN 1 lesions were associated with more than one HPV type. In contrast to CIN 1, both CIN 2 and CIN 3 were relatively homogeneous with regard to associated HPV types. Eighty-eight percent of CIN 2 and 3 lesions contained HPV types 16, 18, or 33. Unlike CIN 1 lesions, which often contained multiple types of HPV, only 7% of CIN 2 and 3 lesions were associated with multiple HPV types. CONCLUSIONS--Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia should be classified into two separate categories--low-grade and high-grade CIN. Since only 29% of low-grade lesions are associated with HPV types 16, 18, or 33, HPV type could potentially play a role in determining the most appropriate clinical management of patients with low-grade CIN. However, prospective follow-up studies of lesional behavior based on HPV type are required before clinical recommendations can be made."

CD008054,0,19048594,0,Post-treatment CIN: randomised clinical trial using hrHPV testing for prediction of residual/recurrent disease.,"We investigated in a randomised clinical trial whether addition of hrHPV testing (high-risk human papillomavirus) to cytological follow-up after treatment for high-grade CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3) can lead to a better selection of women at risk for residual/recurrent CIN. We included 210 women with high-grade CIN undergoing treatment in outpatient clinics in The Netherlands. Follow-up was based on cytology alone and cytology combined with hrHPV detection. Our primary outcome measurement was improving specificity for residual/recurrent CIN after treatment. Secondary, we compared health-care costs and impact of individual hrHPV type on the risk of residual/recurrent CIN. Follow-up by abnormal cytology alone (6, 12 and 24 months after treatment according to the Dutch protocol) showed a lower specificity for detection of residual/recurrent CIN than follow-up by abnormal cytology and presence of hrHPV (80 vs. 91%, relative risk 0.87 (95% CI 0.77-0.99)). Both methods showed no significant difference in sensitivity ((86 vs. 100%) RR 0.86 (95% CI 0.63-1.16)). Comparing different post hoc modifications in the strategy of combined testing showed similar test characteristics when low-risk women (normal cytology and hrHPV negative at 6 months) omitted the 12 months visit (specificity 91%, p = 1.00 z = 0.00). Prediction of residual/recurrent CIN by typing of hrHPV could not be confirmed. Total health-care costs using cytology and hrHPV testing during follow-up decreased when low-risk women omit the 12 months visit. Follow-up after treatment for high-grade CIN can be improved by combining cytology with hrHPV testing. We advise combined cytology and hrHPV testing at 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment. Low-risk women may omit the 12 months visit, resulting in cost reduction."
CD008054,0,7867019,0,"Cervical mass screening in Norway--510,000 smears a year.","In 1990 the Norwegian Department of Health and Social Affairs decided to start a national screening program for cervical cancer. All women aged 25 to 70 years are offered cervical screening every 3 years. The mass screening is organized and run by a central unit, comprising the Cancer Registry of Norway and the National Health Screening Service. For the first 3 years, all spontaneous cervical screening in Norway is recorded in a central, computerized register. In addition, a pilot project has been implemented in two counties to evaluate the organizational aspects of the screening program. A total of 509,641 cervical smears were recorded during the first year of registration. The test frequency was highest in the age group 20 to 29 years (28.4%), while relatively few tests were performed on women in the age group 60 to 69 years (6.6%). The majority of smears (88.6%) had normal tissue morphology, whereas 2.9% displayed different cytological abnormalities. Human papillomavirus (HPV) changes and mild (CIN 1) and moderate (CIN 2) dysplasia had the highest smear rate in women under 40 years. Malignant cellular changes had the highest rate in older age groups. The imbalance in the age distribution of smears and the confinement of cytological abnormalities to the youngest and the oldest age groups support the wide target age range of the screening program."
CD008054,0,8919109,0,Predictive value of morphological nuclear parameters and DNA ploidy pattern in precancerous lesions of the uterine cervix.,"To evaluate the supportive role of image cytometry and DNA ploidy analysis in the precancerous and cancerous lesions of the uterine cervix, the present study was performed on 45 cervical smears, initially diagnosed as dysplasia and malignant. Twenty normal and inflammatory smears were taken as a control for the study. Morphometric parameters and microphotometric DNA measurements were performed on 50 cells in each case. On the basis of nuclear area dysplastic lesions were categorised into two groups i.e. low grade lesions having nuclear area upto 85 sq. mu m and high grade lesions having nuclear area above 85 sq. mu m. The results were compared with DNA ploidy analysis. It is revealed from the study that 85.7% low grade lesions with diploid and polyploid DNA, value mostly regressed to inflammation and 78.5% high grade lesion with aneuploid DNA value progressed to malignancy. However, initial malignant cases having aneuploid DNA value exhibit invasive cancer during their follow up. It indicates that combination of morphometry and DNA cytometry can be used as an adjunct to cytologic diagnosis to predict the biologic outcome of the lesions."

CD008054,0,21174066,0,MALDI imaging as a specific diagnostic tool for routine cervical cytology specimens.,"Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is among the most common malignancies in women worldwide. In developed countries routine cytology screening has dramatically reduced SCC mortality within the last three decades. High risk (HR) human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is the main causal factor in nearly 100% of invasive SCCs, in most cases of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and in nearly all cases of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Detection of HR-HPV DNA has been extensively evaluated for the triage of patients with low grade cytological abnormalities in order to identify those at greatest risk for underlying or developing HSIL or SCC. However, the vast majority of HR-HPV-positive precursor lesions will not progress to invasive cancer. A variety of other screening tools are available which aim to stratify clinically significant HPV infections and cytological alterations. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry is a promising technology to assist in this endeavor. It delivers accurate mass spectrometric information of the sample's proteins and enables the visualization of the spatial distribution of protein expression profiles in correlation with histological features. In this study, 18 samples with Pap IIID or higher (>LSIL) and 14 samples with Pap I-II (WNL) were analyzed by MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). A genetic algorithm was applied to classify spectra resulting in an overall cross validation, sensitivity for Pap IIID and PapÂ I-II of 83.7%, 88.9% and 78.6%, respectively. As this IMS based approach allows for unbiased and automated classifiction of cytological samples it appears to be a promising tool for stratification of cervical Pap smears."

CD008054,0,10587698,0,LSIL biopsies after HSIL smears. Correlation with high-risk HPV and greater risk of HSIL on follow-up.,"Can the risk associated with a high-grade cervical smear be disregarded when followed by a low-grade biopsy? We examined the distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) types in such cases to see whether they segregated preferentially with low-risk or high-risk viruses and compared the distribution with that reported in the literature for women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs). We identified 48 cases of HSIL smears with corresponding LSIL biopsy specimens. Biopsy specimens were tested and typed for HPV by polymerase chain reaction amplification with consensus primers followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and HPVs were scored as low-risk or high-risk types. Thirty-seven cases scored positive for HPV DNA: 2 for low-risk HPV types, 17 for high-risk types, and 18 for types of unknown oncogenicity. The prevalence of high-risk HPV was significantly higher than that of low-risk HPV. There was a higher rate of high-risk HPV than that seen in historic unselected LSIL cases. Cases of HSIL cytology/LSIL histology represent a group distinct from unselected LSILs by virtue of their higher prevalence of high-risk HPV types and, therefore, warrant closer clinical follow-up."

CD008054,0,20483618,0,Isolated osteoradionecrosis of the dens mimicking metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy.,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is common in southern China, and radiotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. A rare late complication of this treatment is the development of osteoradionecrosis (ORN), which seldom involves the cervical spine. We describe a 47-year-old female with undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx, stage II (T2N0M0), who had undergone radiotherapy 51 months prior, and complained of a twitching headache on neck flexion/extension. Imaging studies, including MRI and 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan, suggested the diagnosis of cervical spinal metastasis. However, plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA was undetectable, favoring absence of tumor recurrence. The patient underwent atlantoaxial sublaminar wiring for an unstable spine and a subsequent transoral biopsy, the histopathologic diagnosis of ORN. The postoperative clinical course was uneventful and follow-up MRI, 2 years later, revealed gradual resolution of the lesion. To our knowledge this is the first report of an isolated ORN lesion of the dens confirmed surgically in a patient with a history of previously treated NPC, a lesion at the cervical spine, and inconclusive imaging and biological marker results. We recommend that ORN be suspected until proven otherwise in a previously irradiated patient."
CD008054,0,21151479,0,Qualitative study of women's anxiety and information needs after a diagnosis of cervical dysplasia.,"AIM: Each year almost 15,000 Danish women are diagnosed with cervical dysplasia, a precursor to cervical cancer. The period of medical follow-up, or 'watchful waiting', to monitor for regression or progression of the lesion before deciding if treatment by conisation is necessary can be long. The aim of this study was to examine the experiences of women with different stages of cervical dysplasia and to examine whether their knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV) as the cause of cervical dysplasia influenced their perception of their disease. SUBJECT AND METHODS: We used focus group and individual interviews with 12 women diagnosed with different stages of cervical dysplasia-women who had and had not been conised. Interview guides were prepared on the basis of a literature review that identified important issues and questions for the participants. RESULTS: The participants considered cervical dysplasia to be a highly distressing condition and experienced monitoring as a worrying delay before regression of the lesions or treatment could be initiated. Women expressed a fear of cancer that was not proportional to the stage of their dysplasia, but was determined by their degree of knowledge about their condition. Unlike other sexually transmitted diseases, information about HPV did not result in stigmatisation as the perception of this disease was dominated by cancer. CONCLUSION: This study showed that it is extremely important to address women's fears, their need for information and to ensure better communication with medical practitioners about cervical dysplasia immediately after diagnosis, irrespective of the disease stage."

CD008054,0,20432737,1,"Assessment of HPV DNA test value in management women with cytological findings of ASC-US, CIN1 and CIN2.","The aim of this retrospective study was to answer the following questions: 1) is HPV DNA test for high-risk types able to predict lesion behaviour in women with cytological abnormalities lower than CIN3 (ASC-US, CIN1 and CIN2); 2) how to predict the histological diagnosis CIN3, and 3) is its use in diagnostic management in these patients justified or not? The study included 345 women (11 ASC-US, 312 CIN1 and 22 CIN2) that underwent conventional diagnostic management (repeat cytology and colposcopy with or without histology) and HPV testing for high-risk HPV types by PCR method. The value of HPVDNA test in predicting lesion regression/persistence was assessed in 275 subjects without histology. In 70 subjects, diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value) of repeat cytology and HPV DNA test in predicting severe intraepithelial lesion (CIN3) was determined on the basis of colposcopy guided biopsy. The prevalence of persistent lesions was significantly higher in the group of HPV positive than in the group of HPV negative subjects (37.7% vs. 16.4%; p < 0.001). Positive HPV test was associated with a 3.1-fold risk of lesion persistence [OR (95% CI) = 3.095 (1.65-5.82)]. However, on screening to predict the outcome of cytologically diagnosed cervical lesion with sensitivity of 39.7% and positive predictive value of 37.7% showed that a positive test could not be considered a reliable indicator of lesion persistence. In contrast, the specificity of 82.5% and negative predictive value of 83.6% suggested that a negative test result could be taken as a good indicator of lesion regression. In comparison with repeat cytology, HPV test showed higher sensitivity (69.2% vs. 61.5%) but significantly lower specificity (63.2% vs. 93.0%) and positive predictive value (30.0% vs. 66.7%), and comparable negative predictive value (90.0% vs. 91.4%) in predicting histologically verified CIN3. In one patient with a histological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma with minimal invasion, repeat cytology indicated CIN3, whereas HPV test was negative. Due to authors experience in women with cytological abnormalities lower than CIN3, HPV testing is not a method to reliably predict lesion behaviour (regression, persistence) or presence of CIN3. HPV testing is of limited value in daily routine and should not be widely used until it is definitely demonstrated to be superior to conventional methods in improving the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of CIN3 and invasive carcinoma detection."
CD008054,0,12619110,0,TP53 and head and neck neoplasms.,"Head and neck cancer is an important health problem around the world, accounting for approximately 500,000 new cases each year of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Carcinogenesis of head and neck results from a dysregulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. The major etiologic agents are tobacco and alcohol consumption and for some cases, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. All three factors are associated with the disruption of a cellular pathway essential for the maintenance of cellular integrity, the p53 pathway. The objective of this review is to point out the specificity of p53 gene (TP53) alterations in head and neck cancer in relation with chemocarcinogenesis and to discuss whether or not the determination of p53 alterations will be of clinical relevance in the management of head and neck cancer in terms of prognosis and response to treatments."
CD008054,0,20432730,0,Estimating clinical outcome of HPV induced cervical lesions by combination of capsid protein L1 and p16INK4a protein detection.,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether is possible to predict clinical outcome of cervical lesion by immunoassaying performed on cervical smears. During the two year study period the cervical smears of 81 patients were collected. All patients were tested for human papillomavirus (HPV) infections using Amplycor HPV test. Sixty-six of them were tested as positive for high risk types (hrHPV) and squamous intraepithelial lesion, and in those patients repeated cervical smears were taken every six months. The rest were hrHPV negative patients with normal smears which were used as a negative control in immunoassays with HPV L1 and p16INK4a antibodies. The results of p16INK4a staining in 66 hrHPV positive patients showed impairment of the cervical lesion in 22 (33.3%) and unchanged cytological finding in 21 (31.9%) p16INK4a positive patients, respectively, while improving of cytological finding was seen only in three (4.5%) p16LNK4a positive patients. On the contrary, impairment of cytological finding was not seen in p16INK4a negative patients, while in 17 out of 20 patients from that group improving or normalisation of cytological finding were detected (p < 0.01). Correlation between L1/p16 pattern and cytological finding showed that only in L1-/p16+ cervical lesions was detected impairment of cytological finding during the study period. In L1 +/p16+ group the cytological finding was the same during the follow up in all 11 patients, while in L1 +/p16- group in most patients (9/11) downgrading or normalisation of Pap test were detected. The usage of p16 and HPV L1 markers can be useful in estimation of biologic potentiality and clinical outcome of cervical lesions."

This study analyses the HPV distribution in CIN 2-3, recurrent CIN 2-3 and cervical cancer in Iceland. About 80% of incident cases with CIN 2-3 lesions in 1990 and 1999, 99% of cancer cases in 1990-1994 and 1999-2003, and cases with recurrent CIN 2-3 after conization in 1990 were tested with PCR analysis for the presence of 12 oncogenic HPV types. About 95% of the CIN 2-3 and 92% of the cancer cases tested positive for the included HPV types. HPV 16 was the most frequent type followed by HPV 33, 31, 52, 35, 18, 58, 56, 39, 45, 59 in CIN 2-3 and by HPV 18, 33 45, 31, 39, 52, 35, 51, 56 in cancer. HPV 16 and 18 were associated with a significantly increased cancer risk and HPV 52 and 31 with decreased cancer risk compared to the risk of CIN 3. The HPV distribution differed between histological cancer types, stages and age groups. The number of HPV types was not a significant predictor of cancer. Oncogenic HPV types were found in all persistent or recurrent CIN 2-3 disease after conization. Vaccination against HPV 16/18 is estimated to achieve a minimum 40% reduced rate of CIN 2-3 and a minimum 60% reduced cancer rate. This rate could, however, be increased to 95% and 92% respectively by including all the 12 HPV types tested for in this study."

CD008054,0,12701965,0,Recombinant human interferon gamma in the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) proteins E6 & E7 are considered to be the constitutively expressed neoantigens in a vast majority of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions and cancers. Data available from in-vitro, animal, and small clinical trials suggest that the immunological properties of interferon gamma might enhance early viral protein presentation, thus stimulating a cytotoxic response. In order to study this effect in vivo we undertook a trial in which 20 women with a definite diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade I or II with coexistent high-risk HPV infection (detected by the Hybrid Capture System) underwent four months observation followed by intracervical administration of INFgamma in cases without spontaneous regression (17 cases). Human recombinant interferon gamma 1-b (Imukin) was administered intracervically four times in equal doses in two-day intervals to a total dose of 6,000,000 IU. The results of therapy were verified by punch biopsy evaluation and HPV-DNA testing two months after completion, and revealed a complete response in nine women (complete regression of CIN and remission of HPV infection in 53% of treated cases) and partial response in four cases (lower grade of CIN or/and remission of HPV infection--23.5%). The differences between spontaneous (before treatment) and treatment-related regressions were significant at p < 0.05. We conclude that in selected cases (mainly young women who have not completed their procreation and are compliant with the therapy) a conservative approach to CIN management with intracervical IFNgamma injections seems to be a valuable method."

Methylation, telomerase and clonality studies are also potentially useful, especially in assisting diagnosis of difficult clinical scenarios. This post-genomic era of clinical medicine will continue to make a significant impact in routine pathology practice. The contribution of pathologists is indispensable in analysis involving tissue microarray. On the other hand, both pathologists and bedside clinicians should be aware of the limitation of these molecular targets. Interpretation must be integrated with clinical and histopathological context to avoid misleading judgement. The importance of quality assurance of all such molecular techniques and their ethical implications cannot be over-emphasised."

HPV positive women had more sexual partners in the recent past, more sexual episodes per month, and used spermacides less commonly than controls. Similarly, self-reporters were more likely to have more lifetime sexual partners and earlier age of onset for sexual activity. Cytologically negative HPV positive women were distinguished only by more sexual episodes per month and sexual partners in the past year (borderline significance). Alcohol use was significantly more frequent in all groups, underscoring this variable as a risk factor for both HPV DNA positivity and related disease in young women. Potential explanations for differences between women with clinically and non-clinically related HPV positivity are discussed, with emphasis on the need for followup studies to determine if an epidemiologically distinct subset of HPV DNA positive but clinically negative women are at risk for subsequent cervical disease."

CD008054,0,12622003,0,[Diagnostic significance of human papillomavirus overestimated].,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of oncogenic viruses, of which some are known to cause cervical cancer in women. The causal relation between infection and cervical cancer is well established. There is however a discrepancy between the rate of infection and the incidence of (pre)neoplastic lesions of the cervix. Cohort studies of the natural history of this virus show that many, if not most, young females become infected, but that the infection usually clears without any consequences. This high infection rate precludes the use of HPV diagnosis for primary screening for cervical cancer. The low specificity precludes its use for triage of borderline cervical lesions. Critical appraisal of different diagnostic approaches using a direct or indirect molecular detection method of HPV does not show a convincing advantage over 'conservative' diagnostic cytological regiments. Perhaps the absence of the virus is more significant than its presence."

A multicenter cross-sectional study of 1,889 women from five clinical settings in two Spanish cities was conducted from May to November 2004. Oncogenic HPV infection was tested by an Hybrid Capture II (HC2) test, and positive samples were genotyped by direct sequencing using three different primer sets in L1 (MY09/11 and GP5+/GP6+) and E6/E7. HPV16 variants were identified by sequencing the E6, E2, and L1 regions. Four hundred twenty-five samples were positive for the HC2 test, 31.5% from CSW/IPW and 10.7% from the general population. HPV16 was the most frequent type. Distinct profiles of oncogenic HPV type prevalence were observed across the two populations. In order of decreasing frequency, HPV types 16, 31, 58, 66, 56, and 18 were most frequent in CSW/IPW women, and types 16, 31, 52, 68, 51, and 53 were most frequent in the general population. We analyzed HPV16 intratype variants, and a large majority (78.7%) belonged to the European lineage. AA variants were detected in 16.0% of cases. African variants belonging to classes Af1 (4.0%) and Af2 (1.3%) were detected. Different HPV types and HPV16 intratype variants are involved in oncogenic HPV infections in our population. These results suggest that HPV type distribution differs in CSW/IPW women and in the general population, although further analysis is necessary."

Like cancers of the cervix, most cases of anal cancer are associated with infection with human papillomavirus (HPV).

Among 2190 incident cases of CIS, followed for a total of 22,225 person-years, 95 metachronous cancers were observed vs 77.9 expected, corresponding to a significant standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.2. Ten cases of invasive cervical cancer were observed vs 3.0 expected (SIR = 3.4, P < 0.01), the excess being larger in the first 10 years since CIS diagnosis. A total of 11 cases of four major tobacco-related sites (lung, mouth or pharynx, oesophagus and urinary bladder) were observed vs 5.1 expected, corresponding to a significant SIR of 2.2. The excess was observed > or = 10 years after CIS diagnosis. There was also an excess of non-melanomatous skin cancers (29 observed, 16.9 expected, SIR = 1.7; P < 0.01), but not of skin melanoma and of any of the other neoplasms considered, including breast and corpus uteri. This population-based study, therefore, finds an excess of invasive cervical cancer in the short term after CIS diagnosis, and a medium- to long-term excess risk of tobacco-related and non-melanomatous skin neoplasms. These findings are discussed in terms of increased surveillance and case ascertainment after CIS, and of potential shared risk factors (tobacco and/or viral infections)."

The prevalence of HPV infection is highest among adolescents and young adults. This study was undertaken to explore first year college students' knowledge about HPVs and to determine whether there were gender differences in this knowledge. An anonymous survey was distributed to all first year students at a private university. The results were analyzed by gender. We found that 96.2% of males and 95.4% of females had heard of genital warts, although only 4.2% of males and 11.6% of females knew that HPV caused genital warts. Although there was a greater awareness of genital warts than HPV in this population, students were uncertain about modes of transmission of both genital warts and HPVs, and unclear about the importance of HPV infection relative to other STDs. For both men and women (87% and 87.4%, respectively), health education classes were the major source of information about STDs. We conclude that health education should be reconceptualized to incorporate a better understanding of STDs, including HPV infection, by engaging adolescents and young adults in exploring the biological and social context of STDs, their public health importance, strategies for prevention, and the uncertainty of our scientific knowledge."

These two neoplasms differ dramatically in age distribution and relationship to precursor lesions, making a common etiology unlikely. The apparent discrepancies can be explained by a hypothesis that implicates human papillomavirus as an etiologic factor for the majority of cervical carcinomas but for only a small proportion of vulvar carcinomas. Most vulvar carcinomas occur in older women and are not related to human papillomavirus, whereas a subset of vulvar carcinomas occur in young women and are related to this virus. Characterization of two distinct types of vulvar carcinoma may clarify associated risk factors and may have important implications in the clinical management of this disease."

These infections can occur in one or multiple areas of the female genitalia but the vulva is usually the initial site of implantation for HPV. We carried out a long-term follow-up study of adolescents to evaluate the incidence of single or multiple lesions in the lower genital tract, the correlation between sexual behaviour and their localisation and behavioural risk factors for persistence and recurrence of HPV lesions and cervical intraepithelial lesion (CIN). We interviewed 268 women aged 12-21 years who had previously had cytology and/or physical examination suspicious for HPV infection. We asked them information about their lifestyle, sexual behaviour, work, personal or family history of genital warts and school attendance. Those who smoked more than five cigarettes a day were considered ""smokers"". We have no specific data about oral contraception although we know that none of the patients had used oral contraceptives for more than two years. Two hundred and thirty-four young women between the ages of 12 and 21 years were included in the study. The diagnostic schedule for a complete evaluation included exo- and endocervical cytology, colposcopy and directed biopsy. We found that in 126 out of 234 (53.8%) adolescents using contraceptives, only 85 (36.3%) had used a condom. The sites most frequently affected by lesions were the vulva, perianus and perineum (194/234; 82.9%), and the cervix (125/234; 53.4%). Vaginal lesions were detected in only 29/234 patients (12.3%). In 161 patients, sexual habits, age at first intercourse (p = 0.68), frequency of intercourse (p = 0.49) and number of lifetime partners (p = 0.27) as well as age (p = 0.26) played a role in transmission and incidence of HPV infection but not in the location of the lesions. This could be due to coexistent clinical and subclinical multiple infections as well as transmission via intercourse or from other sources, including tampons. HPV infection is detected by abnormal pap test, but the low correlation with colposcopic and histological findings in this study justify the support of other examinations such as colposcopy and punch biopsy for diagnosis. Moreover more attention should be paid to the psychological aspect of diagnoses and treatment of adolescents compared to older women as there was a high rate of patients lost in our study: 75/234 (32.05%) before LASER surgery and 55/159 (34.59%) during follow-up. Only 12-45% of sexually active adolescent girls had obtained Pap smear screening.

CD008054,0,16844268,0,Chapter 20: Issues in planning cervical cancer screening in the era of HPV vaccination.,"Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines will likely have an impact as a preventive strategy for cervical cancer. Screening for precancerous lesions cannot be discontinued because vaccination will not protect against HPV types not included in the first generation of vaccines. Moreover, protection for the target types, 16 and 18, which are responsible for most cases of cervical precancerous lesions and cancer, and 6 and 11, which are responsible for a substantial proportion of low-grade lesions, cannot be expected to be absolute, and the likely implementation of HPV vaccination in young women will not impact older groups initially. Cervical cancer control programs will need to be re-evaluated because the addition of HPV vaccination will make the existing approach of high-frequency screening by cytology too costly and inefficient for most public health budgets. Simply making cytology screening less frequent may not be a viable strategy in light of potential problems that may plague cytology performance in conditions of low lesion prevalence. HPV testing has the performance characteristics that would make it an ideal primary screening test in such conditions. Cytology should be reserved for triage of HPV-positive cases because it is more likely to perform with sufficient accuracy in high-prevalence conditions. Another advantage of using HPV testing as a primary screening tool is the opportunity to create infection registries that can link test results from the same women over time, thus allowing an efficient and low-cost strategy to monitor long-term protection among vaccinated women."

During the extended follow-up period, in the per-protocol susceptible population, none of the vaccine recipients was found to be infected with HPV-16 or developed HPV-16-related cervical lesions; among placebo recipients, 6 women were found to be infected with HPV-16 (vaccine efficacy [VE]=100%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 29-100%) and 3 women developed HPV-16-related cervical lesions (VE=100%; 95% CI: <0-100%). Approximately 86% of vaccine recipients remained HPV-16 competitive Luminex immunoassay seropositive at an average of 8.5 years of follow-up. During the combined original trial and extended follow-up period, in the intention-to-treat population, 20 and 22 women developed any cervical lesion regardless of HPV type among the vaccine and placebo recipients, respectively (VE=15%; 95% CI: <0-56%).

These include options that incorporate HPV testing either as a triage for mild and borderline smear abnormalities or as a primary screening test. Outcomes include the predicted impact on resource use, total cost, life years and cost-effectiveness. Extensive sensitivity analysis has been carried out to explore the importance of the uncertainty associated with disease natural history and the impact of screening. Under baseline assumptions, the cost-effectiveness of different options for introducing LBC appears favourable, and these results are consistent under a range of assumptions for its impact on the diagnostic effectiveness of cytology. However, if we assume a higher marginal cost of LBC in comparison to conventional methods, primary smear testing options are predicted to be more cost-effective without LBC. Combined LBC primary smear and HPV testing with a 5-year interval is similar in both cost and effectiveness to the other 3-yearly options of primary smear testing or primary HPV testing alone. However, both primary HPV testing and combined options would give rise to a far greater risk of inappropriate colposcopy throughout a woman's lifetime.

We believe that HPV infection and preneoplastic and/or neoplastic lesions occur more often in immunodepressed HIV-positive patients, and that on the grounds of the high risk of precancerous lesions in this population and the low sensibility of the Pap test, it is advisable to perform a colposcopic examination to discover early lesions that must undergo a specific biopsy."
CD008054,0,11127922,0,Clinical relevance of HPV 16/18 testing methods in cervical squamous cell carcinoma.,"Three different in situ hybridization (ISH) methods were compared for their clinical relevance and suitability in detecting human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 in 55 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the uterine cervix. After the initial biopsy, surgery, and/or radiation therapy, patients were followed for 5 to 8 years. A biotinylated cDNA probe for HPV 16/18 was applied to serial sections in combination with conventional streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase ISH (a widely applied routine procedure), streptavidin-Nanogold-silver ISH, and tyramide-signal amplified (TSA) streptavidin-Nanogold-gold ISH. The TSA principle is also known as catalyzed reporter deposition and is, apart from in situ PCR, probably today's most sensitive technique for detecting papillomavirus infection by microscopic means. Nearly 65.5% of the cases showed specific HPV 16/18 detection with TSA ISH, whereas 43.6% were positive with streptavidin-Nanogold-silver-ISH, and only 40.0% with peroxidase-based ISH. Statistical analyses comparing early and advanced stages in both HPV-positive and -negative groups revealed a significantly better outcome for early disease patients; statistical significance was most pronounced with TSA ISH. In a subgroup of patients who had received radiation therapy without prior surgery (n = 35), those with advanced disease were significantly less likely to have HPV 16/18 infection than those with early disease. A significantly better overall survival was observed in those women with HPV 16/18-positive carcinomas who had undergone surgery before radiation therapy (seen with all three methods). We conclude that TSA, in addition to being the most sensitive HPV in situ method applied in this study, gave the most significant and clinically relevant statistical results."

This follow-up study assessed the persistence of the systemic and mucosal immune responses together with the safety profile of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine administered to young women aged 10-25 years. Serum and cervicovaginal secretion (CVS) samples were collected at prespecified time-points during the 48-month follow-up period. Anti-HPV-16/18 antibody levels in serum and CVS were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). At Month 48, all subjects remained seropositive for serum anti-HPV-16 and -18 antibodies. As previously observed, anti-HPV-16 and -18 antibodies levels (ELISA Units/mL) were higher in subjects vaccinated at the age of 10-14 years (2862.2 and 940.8) compared to subjects vaccinated at the age of 15-25 years (1186.2 and 469.8). Moreover, anti-HPV-16 and -18 antibodies in CVS were still detectable for subjects aged 15-25 years (84.1% and 69.7%, respectively). There was a strong correlation between serum and CVS anti-HPV-16 and -18 antibodies levels (correlation coefficients = 0.84 and 0.90 at Month 48, respectively) supporting the hypothesis of transudation or exudation of serum immunoglobulin G antibodies through the cervical epithelium. The HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine had a clinically acceptable safety profile. In conclusion, this follow-up study shows that the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine administered to preteen/adolescents girls and young women induces long-term systemic and mucosal immune response and has a clinically acceptable safety profile up to 4 years after the first vaccine dose."

The subjects were 365 women referred for investigation of cytological abnormality who were found to have histological evidence of HPV infection alone or in association with CIN1 or CIN2 and were considered suitable for local destructive treatment. The intervention consisted of immediate treatment using a carbon dioxide laser or no treatment. Women in both groups were followed by cytological and colposcopic examinations at intervals of four months. Twelve months after randomization, 25 per cent of women in the non-treatment group had progressed to a more severe degree of histological abnormality compared with 4 per cent in the treatment group (95 per cent confidence interval (CI) for difference in proportion 14-28 per cent). Spontaneous regression of cytological abnormality occurred in 26 per cent (95 per cent CI 19-33 per cent) of untreated women. It is concluded that the short-term efficacy of laser vaporization in the treatment of these lesions has been established.

They were characterized by dermal fibroblastic proliferation with overlying, often ulcerated hyperplastic epidermis. Electron microscopic findings supported the fibroblastic nature of the neoplastic cells. The 23 tumors came from 20 cats and were submitted from veterinary clinics in Wisconsin and Minnesota. These tumors occurred most commonly in young cats and were found primarily on the head, neck, and digits. Fifteen of the 17 cats for which breed was reported were domestic shorthair cats. In 11/20 cases, there was confirmed exposure to cattle. Local recurrence of the tumor following surgical excision was reported in 7 of the 18 cats for which follow-up information was available. Metastasis was not documented in any of the cases. Two of the 19 tumors tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) had no amplifiable DNA. The remaining 17 were positive for papillomavirus by PCR. No papillomavirus DNA was detected in three other feline skin tumors (cutaneous mast cell tumor, malignant lymphoma, and fibrosarcoma) that served as controls. This is the first report of detection of papillomavirus in feline tumors that have clinicopathologic features similar to equine sarcoids."
CD008054,0,15574793,0,Folate is associated with the natural history of high-risk human papillomaviruses.,"Several micronutrients have been implicated in cervical carcinogenesis. However, their mode of action is still a matter of speculation. In particular, it is unclear whether certain nutrients reduce the probability of acquiring high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) or whether they facilitate the clearance of high-risk HPV. We conducted a 24-month prospective follow-up study to test the hypothesis that systemic concentrations of folate are associated with the occurrence and duration of high-risk HPV infections after controlling for other micronutrients (vitamins B(12), A, E, and C, total carotene) and known risk factors for high-risk HPV infections and cervical cancer. Circulating concentrations of these micronutrients and risk factors for cervical cancer were determined in a cohort of 345 women who were at risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Using the hybrid capture 2 (HC-2) assay, high-risk HPV status was evaluated at 6-month intervals up to 24 months. All women had at least three consecutive visit high-risk HPV test results. Higher folate status was inversely associated with becoming HC-2 test-positive [odds ratio (OR): 0.27; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.08-0.91; P = 0.04]. Women with higher folate status were significantly less likely to be repeatedly HC-2 test-positive (OR: 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13-0.86; P = 0.02) and more likely to become test-negative during the study (OR: 2.50; 95% CI, 1.18-5.30; P = 0.02). To our knowledge, this is the first long-term prospective follow-up study reporting an independent protective role of higher folate status on several aspects of the natural history of high-risk HPV after controlling for known risk factors and other micronutrients. Improving folate status in subjects at risk of getting infected or already infected with high-risk HPV may have a beneficial impact in the prevention of cervical cancer."
CD008054,0,16847471,0,Frequent gain of the human telomerase gene TERC at 3q26 in cervical adenocarcinomas.,"The level of genomic amplification of the human telomerase gene TERC, which maps to chromosome band 3q26, was determined in primary cervical adenocarcinomas. Interphase nuclei prepared from archival material of 12 primary cervical adenocarcinomas, eight of which were human papillomavirus positive, were hybridised with a triple colour probe set specific for centromeres of chromosomes 3 and 7 and the TERC gene. We observed high proportions of nuclei with increased absolute copy numbers for TERC in all tumours (mean 3.3; range 2.3-5.2). Amplification of the human telomerase gene TERC is a consistent aberration in cervical adenocarcinomas. Therefore, application of our probe set may provide an objective genetic test for the assessment of glandular cells in Pap smears and hence for the diagnosis of cervical adenocarcinomas."
CD008054,0,19166485,0,Triage of women with equivocal or low-grade cervical cytology results: a meta-analysis of the HPV test positivity rate.,"Consistent evidence underlines the utility of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing in the management of women with equivocal cervical cytological abnormalities, but not in case of low-grade lesions. We performed a meta-analysis including studies where the high-risk probe of the Hybrid Capture-II is used to triage these two cytological categories. The triage test-positivity rate reflects the colposcopy referral workload.Data were pooled on the HPV test positivity rate in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS/ASC-US) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), derived from different cytological classification systems. The meta-analysis was restricted to studies, published between 1991 and 2007. A random-effect model was applied for meta-analytical pooling and the influence of covariates on the HPV positivity rate was analyzed by meta-regression. The variation by age was assessed within individual studies since age strata were not defined uniformly. On an average, 43% (95% CI: 40-46%) of women with ASCUS/ASC-US were high-risk HPV positive (range 23-74%). In women with LSIL, the pooled positivity rate was 76% (95% CI: 71-81%; range 55-89%). In spite of considerable inter-study heterogeneity, the difference in HPV positivity between the two triage groups was large and highly significant: 32% (95% CI: 27-38%). HPV rates dropped tremendously as age and cutoffs of test positivity increased. Other factors (cytological classification system, country, continent, collection method and year of publication) had no statistically significant impact, except in LSIL triage where HPV positivity was significantly lower in European compared to American studies. Women with LSIL, especially younger women, have high HPV positivity rates suggesting limited utility of reflex HPV triaging these cases. Research is needed to identify more specific methods to triage women with low-grade squamous cervical lesions."

In this study it was shown that the power of prognosis is valid even up to 20 years. In this material from 619 cervical carcinoma patients the MGS scores turned out to remain as strong as earlier proven. Earlier studies have shown that MGS is superior to other mono- and multifactorial grading systems, histological differentiation into cell types, age, clinical stage, irradiation and DNA-analysis. Treatment of cervical squamous cell carcinoma is more specific today to meet the patients' need for instance to preserve fertility or to minimize operation and eventually radiotherapy.

CD008054,0,15124127,0,Novel agents and incremental advances in the treatment of head and neck cancer.,"Cancer of the head and neck is an important medical problem, with approximately 46,500 cases predicted in the United States alone in 2003. Worldwide, more than 600,000 cases are anticipated. While several different histologic subtypes of head and neck cancer are seen in different parts of the world, more than 90% of tumors diagnosed in the United States are squamous cell carcinomas. Major strides in the management of this disease have been made in the last decade. These include, but are not limited to, the evolution of organ preservation, the increasingly well recognized role of concurrent chemoradiation therapy as either definitive therapy for unresectable disease or adjuvant therapy for high-risk surgical disease, and significant improvements in cytotoxic chemotherapy. The role of chemotherapy in this disease has been a subject of debate. Chemotherapy is now routinely included in the multimodality treatment of unresectable disease of the oral pharynx, larynx, and oral cavity. There is now increasing evidence supporting the role of induction chemotherapy in head and neck cancer. As intensified chemotherapy and radiation therapy have improved local control, the increasing incidence of distant metastases has necessitated the need for enhanced systemic control. These approaches are the topics of extensive investigations."

CD008054,0,17222357,0,Noonan syndrome.,"Noonan Syndrome (NS) is characterised by short stature, typical facial dysmorphology and congenital heart defects. The incidence of NS is estimated to be between 1:1000 and 1:2500 live births. The main facial features of NS are hypertelorism with down-slanting palpebral fissures, ptosis and low-set posteriorly rotated ears with a thickened helix. The cardiovascular defects most commonly associated with this condition are pulmonary stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Other associated features are webbed neck, chest deformity, mild intellectual deficit, cryptorchidism, poor feeding in infancy, bleeding tendency and lymphatic dysplasias. The syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In approximately 50% of cases, the disease is caused by missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12, resulting in a gain of function of the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 protein. Recently, mutations in the KRAS gene have been identified in a small proportion of patients with NS. A DNA test for mutation analysis can be carried out on blood, chorionic villi and amniotic fluid samples. NS should be considered in all foetuses with polyhydramnion, pleural effusions, oedema and increased nuchal fluid with a normal karyotype. With special care and counselling, the majority of children with NS will grow up and function normally in the adult world. Management should address feeding problems in early childhood, evaluation of cardiac function and assessment of growth and motor development. Physiotherapy and/or speech therapy should be offered if indicated. A complete eye examination and hearing evaluation should be performed during the first few years of schooling. Preoperative coagulation studies are indicated. Signs and symptoms lessen with age and most adults with NS do not require special medical care."
CD008054,0,20664421,0,"ACOG Committee Opinion No. 463: Cervical cancer in adolescents: screening, evaluation, and management.","Based on several recent studies, new guidelines for initiation of cervical cancer screening have been developed. Evidence shows that screening before the age of 21 years does not change the rate of cervical cancer in that age group or in older women. Cervical cancer, in general, is extremely rare in those younger than 21 years. Consequently, cervical cancer screening should begin at age 21 years. If cytology is performed before age 21 years, it is important to recognize that the management of cervical cytologic abnormalities in adolescents differs from that of the adult population. The publication of the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology 2006 consensus guidelines has led to major changes in the management of cervical disease in adolescents, which emphasize minimal to no intervention. These guidelines advise against human papillomavirus testing and recommend observation for the management of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 in adolescents. In addition, observation is preferred for the management of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2. The guidelines were established to minimize the potential negative effect that screening can cause, unnecessary referrals for colposcopy, and the negative effect that treatment can have on future pregnancy outcomes."

To identify factors related to histologic proven persistence or regression. Twenty-eight small histologic (marker) biopsies with adequate follow-up were analyzed for human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes and different immunoquantitative proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and differentiation markers. All cases had a biopsy-interval between the marker and first follow-up biopsy of at least 100 days (median, 8.2 months; range, 3.4-22.5 months). Follow-up was classified as regression or persistence. All lesions were high-risk (hr) HPV and p16 positive, 63% for HPV-16 or HPV-16 mixed with other hr genotypes, while 37% had other hrHPV types. The marker biopsies of the persistent HSILs had lower p53 and retinoblastoma protein (pRb) detected in the deep half of the epithelium (P = 0.001 and 0.02, respectively) than nonpersistent HSILs. The degree of positivity of p16, Ki-67, cyclin D1, lesion extent, positivity of the resection margins, and patient age were all unrelated to persistence or regression. Lesions with HPV-16 or mixed-16 genotypes had a significantly lower percentage of pRb (P = 0.02), p53 (P = 0.02), and cyclin D (P = 0.04) positive nuclei in the deep epithelial layers. In agreement with this, type-16 positive HSILs had a lower regression percentage than those with other HPV types, but the difference was not significant. HSILs with combined negativity/low positivity for p53 and pRb protein in small histologic biopsies are highly likely to persist, contrasting those in which one of these cell cycle regulators is strongly positive (p53 > 15%; pRb > 40%)."

CD008054,0,12192269,0,Present standards for cervical cancer screening.,"Survival rates for cancer of the uterine cervix have improved over the last 40 years largely because of the impact of screening measures such as the Pap smear. The ability to screen and treat women for preinvasive disease, cervical dysplasia, is the key factor leading to the reduction in the incidence of invasive cervical cancer. More recently, the ability to test women for the causative agent, the human papilloma virus, has emerged as a potential screening tool. New research has focused on new technologies for Pap smear screening such as thin layer technology, the appropriate intervals for screening, and the appropriate methods of incorporation of human papilloma virus testing into the screening protocols. Reviews of published studies evaluating the efficacy of new technologies suggest that there is still insufficient information to confirm improved outcome; however, results to date suggest that thin layer Pap smear technology may improve sensitivity in the detection of cervical dysplasia. Automated rescreening technologies in use may decrease the number of false-negative Pap smears and are an option for laboratories. Various professional groups and countries have differing recommendations on the interval for screening, primarily on the basis of cost-effectiveness. Some of the most important new information this year regarding cervical cancer screening includes the new Bethesda System for the reporting of Pap smears and the new guidelines for the management of the abnormal Pap smear by the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology. These guidelines incorporate human papilloma virus testing based on a multicenter trial documenting its efficacy in the triage of women with atypical squamous cells on Pap smear. These recommendations are reviewed along with the current literature on cervical cancer screening."

In 2005, there were 2486 deaths from cervical cancer, accounting for 1.8% of the total number of cancer deaths in Japan. Cervical cancer screening using conventional cytology has been conducted worldwide. The guideline for cervical cancer screening was developed based on the established method. The efficacies of conventional and liquid-based cytology, human papillomavirus testing alone and two combination methods were evaluated. On the basis of the balance of the benefits and harms, recommendations for population-based and opportunistic screening were formulated. Five methods of cervical cancer screening were evaluated. On the basis of the analytic framework involving key questions, 3450 articles published from January 1985 to October 2007 were selected using MEDLINE and other methods. After the systematic literature review, 66 articles were confirmed. The results of 33 studies were consistent, and the evidence was sufficient to evaluate the effect of conventional cytology screening. The accuracy of liquid-based cytology was almost equal to that of conventional cytology. Although human papillomavirus testing and combination methods showed high sensitivity, no study has evaluated the reduction in mortality from cervical cancer. Except for the possibility of overdiagnosis, no serious adverse effects of cervical cancer screening were found. Cervical cancer screening using conventional and liquid-based cytology is recommended for population-based and opportunistic screening due to sufficient evidence. Cervical cancer screening using either human papillomavirus testing alone or two combination methods is not recommended for population-based screening due to insufficient evidence."

Recurrence of high-grade CIN was not affected by the VLP-16 seropositivity. Recurrence of carcinoma showed the borderline association with HPV-16 seropositivity (P=0.06). The association between the cancer recurrence and seropositivity was not found in the logistic regression analysis. Two patients dying of cancer during the follow-up period were both seronegative (P=0.01). In conclusion, serologic testing for HPV-16 VLP antibody provides a disease indicator of cervical lesions and potential prognostic parameter of cervical carcinoma."
CD008054,0,10820526,0,Endocervical reactive atypia: a histologic-cytologic study.,"Of 1,500 cervical tissue specimens, 27 cases showed histologic changes of reactive glandular atypia which we defined as endocervical cells with large hyperchromatic, often irregular nuclei, which did not fulfill the criteria for endocervical adenocarcinoma. Eighteen of these 27 cases had preceding or concurrent cervico-vaginal smears. Six of these showed cells which were similar to those seen in histologic sections. The cytologic characteristics of these cells are defined. To determine if atypia is related to inflammatory-regenerative changes, 29 cases of endocervical polyps were examined, of which 11 showed histologic changes of endocervical reactive atypia; 4 showed these changes cytologically as well. Twenty-eight cases of routine hysterectomy specimens were examined, of which 2 cases showed endocervical reactive atypia, which indicated that the atypical changes were indeed reactive. Nine out of 27 cases were associated with hormonal usage. Fourteen cases were associated with squamous intraepithelial lesions or evidence of human papilloma virus. Follow-up of our 27 index cases revealed no progression to adenocarcinoma. These findings indicate that atypia, as we define it, of the endocervix can be due to inflammatory-reparative changes or possibly related to hormonal usage, and permit its separation from precursor lesions of endocervical adenocarcinoma."
CD008054,0,8387317,0,Human papillomavirus infection in papillomas and nondiseased respiratory sites of patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis using the polymerase chain reaction.,"We examined human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in biopsy specimens and cellular scrapes that were taken from respiratory papillomas and six nondiseased sites from the respiratory tract of seven patients. Human papillomavirus was detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification, followed by DNA hybridization with probes for specific HPV types. All papillomas (100.0%, n = 5) were positive only for HPV type 6 or 11. In the nondiseased site specimens, 61.3% (19/31) of the specimens were positive, again only for HPV type 6 or 11. Among the nondiseased site specimens from the cervical trachea, intrathoracic trachea, and bronchus, 80% to 100% were HPV positive compared with only 25% to 50% of HPV infection detected in the nasopharynx, posterior tonsillar pillar, and aryepiglottic fold. These results support the tenet that HPV infection is present in clinically normal respiratory tract tissue and that the reservoir site of reinfection is more commonly in the lower airway. However, patients with upper-airway involvement were more likely to be diagnosed as having severe disease."
CD008054,0,20108714,0,HBCUs inform students and the community about cervical cancer.,"In summary, HBCUs can no longer remain reactive, but must spearhead efforts to increase both the health of the student body, as well as the community at large. HBCUs should collaboratively initiate a ""Call to Action"", whereby policies and programs could be created to aid in the prevention of HPV and other STIs. To support this action, HBCUs could more actively pursue funding sources that support both universities and the communities in which they exist. Student orientation could be redefined to include short courses in STI awareness and prevention, and be communicated in a manner that is professional, yet engaging to students. Moreover, university departments which have an interest in the health of communities should supervise these efforts. The knowledge of university faculty members within departments of Nursing, Social Work, Public Health, Rehabilitation Counseling and Physical Education should extend beyond the classroom and into the community. Clark commented, ""Perhaps course content across departments could be revised to encompass an increased focus on practice skills which support awareness and prevention efforts"". Through employment, volunteerism and student internships, each of these disciplines have established relationships with the surrounding community and understand the associated critical needs. Such relationships provide the best environment for both the creation and implementation of services, and provide students with a model of how to ""give back"" to the community by utilizing their education. Campus health centers should be more prevention-driven beyond the distribution of condoms and pamphlets, to collaborate with local area high schools and community-based organizations to create an information network accessible to students and community residents. Additionally, health centers should promote the availability of HPV vaccination, which depending on state of residence and age, may be free or available at a discounted cost. According to Bynum, some HBCUs have already begun to promote and provide the vaccination, ""South Carolina State University is one of the HBCUs which provides the HPV vaccination and promotes HPV prevention. There has been a great initiative by their health center to focus prevention efforts on incoming freshman"". HBCU administrations must bear in mind that beyond the campus, students will undoubtedly carry the information learned during college into the communities in which they live after graduation and moreover, utilize this information as a basis for educating their children and families. Community activist and Columbia resident Linda ""T'Zima"" Brown, whose 16 year-old son is considering application to Delaware State University, believes that HBCUs bear a great responsibility to the well-being of the community, ""We as residents should be able to take part in the events that our black colleges have. Black colleges used to operate from a more inclusive, family approach, and we need to get back to that; plus, many HBCUs are supported with our state dollars, so the community should be able to look to them for information aside from what our children relay to us""."

The healing process of the cervical epithelium usually began from both the squamous and columnar epithelial borders, starting around the 10th day after laser therapy; the process covered the whole tissue defect with multilayered epithelium within seven weeks. Inflammatory changes also usually abated within that time. Cytomorphologically, laser therapy resulted in the occurrence of (mostly degenerated) ""fiber-type"" and orangeophilic cells in smears taken during the first two weeks after treatment. Tissue repair cells were seen in smears collected from the first posttherapy day through the fourth week after laser therapy. Using computer-assisted image cytometry, the reparative cells in samples taken shortly after treatment (roughly, the first to fifth days) exhibited more hyperchromatic (3-4N) nuclei than did those in later samples; however, the mean DNA content of the early reparative cells was generally concentrated around that of the 2N reference cells. These findings suggest that follow-up, including cytologic and colposcopic examination, for the early detection of residual or recurrent lesions should start in the eighth week and continue periodically for at least one year."
CD008054,0,16729900,0,Human papillomavirus testing in primary cervical screening and abnormal Papanicolaou management.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a necessary cause of cervical cancer; HPV testing capitalizes on this fact to maximize the clinical benefits of cervical screening and abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) test management. HPV tests in combination with Pap tests are 96% to 100% sensitive for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 and cancer. However, because HPV infection is common in young women and most commonly transient, HPV testing is not recommended as part of primary cervical screening for women younger than 30 years of age. HPV testing is recommended for women of any age for the clarification of atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and as an option for follow-up of women with HPV-positive ASC-US, atypical squamous cells ""cannot rule out high-grade,"" or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions not found to have CIN 2/3. HPV testing is also recommended as an alternative to colposcopy and/or cytology for follow-up of treated cases. Proper use of HPV testing improves the management of women with cytologic abnormalities. In addition, a negative HPV test in combination with a normal Pap test result in women age 30 and older allows the safe extension of the interval between cervical screenings. Thus, when used properly, HPV testing may reduce morbidity and mortality and do so in a cost-effective manner."
CD008054,0,18191912,0,[Integrating HPV testing for primary screening?].,"Cervical cancer, the second most common cancer in young women in France, is still today imperfectly screened even with the advent of primary prevention for this cancer in the form of prophylactic HPV vaccination. Indeed, the cervical Pap smear and its cytologic analysis, both operator and reader dependent, have limited sensitivities requiring repeated samplings and above all, producing a high rate of falsely negative tests. Although most cancers occur in women who are either not or insufficiently screened, the problem with cervical smears is the fact that cancers are also often diagnosed in young women having follow-ups in accordance with professional guidelines. The absence of an organized screening in France results in an inadequate female population coverage. Nowadays, it is unanimously recognized that high-risk papillomaviruses (HR HPV) represent the only independent risk factor for cervical cancer and that there cannot be any disease without this virus. It is therefore this strong association between a viral agent and the cervical cancer which opened the door firstly, to the notion of prophylactic vaccination and secondly, to the integration of HR HPV testing in the screening for precancerous lesions. Molecular biological techniques based on the HR HPV genome detection within the female genital tract have shown a very high sensitivity without any inter and intraobserver variability and an excellent negative predictive value. Their integration in the primary screening for cervical cancer would improve the relevance of the latter and would suit the need for a wider population coverage and even for an organized screening thanks to the possibility for self-sampling. The specificity of these tests is inferior to that of the cervical smear, but the management of the falsely positive HPV tests has proved to be efficient by sorting residual cells obtained from liquid-based cytology. What is urgent in France is the need for an organized screening programme in order to improve population coverage and, this does not go against neither a vaccination promotion nor the integration of new technologies. Moreover, the last three randomized trials published in October 2007 have shown that it was quite safely possible to extend the time interval between two consecutive viral testing and thus improving the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening. The aim of this work was to analyze publications on the subject in order to conclude, according to proof levels obtained by different studies, on its usefulness in the secondary prevention of cervical cancer."

In preliminary studies, the authors demonstrated that, among many dysregulatory phenomena at the cytologic level, the occurrence of significant DNA content aberrations were in good correlation with progressive cervical changes; and, as a marker for this, the significance of cells with nuclear DNA content > 9c (9c cells) was investigated using slide-based cytometry. The objective of the current study was to determine whether 9c cells in cytologic samples that presented with dysplasia and with high-risk HPV types were associated with the development of higher grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN II+)."

CD008054,0,7981060,0,Induction of the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene GADD153 by cisplatin in vitro and in vivo.,"The inability to assess the extent of tumour damage immediately following treatment is a major clinical obstacle to improving the management of cancer patients. Normally, the effectiveness of chemotherapy or radiation therapy cannot be determined for at least several weeks after treatment. We studied the increase in mRNA of the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene GADD153 in human 2008 ovarian carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo to determine whether treatment-induced increases in the level of GADD153 mRNA could be used as a marker of the extent of tumour damage. GADD153 mRNA was increased in a transient, dose-dependent manner by cisplatin (DDP) when the tumour cells were grown both in vitro and as tumour xenografts in nude mice. The magnitude of induction of GADD153 mRNA did not vary significantly between different 2008 xenografts treated with equal doses of DDP, and GADD153 mRNA induction correlated with the degree of in vitro cytotoxicity for two different schedules of drug exposure. DDP increased GADD153 mRNA levels in melanoma and head and neck xenograft models as well. We conclude that the increase in GADD153 mRNA can be used to detect tumour injury at time points as short as 24 h after administration of DDP."

CD008054,0,9184031,0,[Detection of human papilloma virus DNA and expression of p53 protein in patients with head and neck cancer].,"We investigated the p53 expression and the presence of HPV DNA in 90 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the head and neck and the relation to clinicopathological parameters and patients' prognosis. Immunohistochemical analysis of p53 protein was conducted by using monoclonal anti-p53 antibody, clone 1801 and clone 240. The relationship between the overexpression of p53 and the duration of survival of patients was analyzed. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out with consensus primers capable of detecting HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 52b and 58. In situ hybridization was performed in the mesopharyngeal carcinoma to confirm the presence of HPV genomes in cancer cells with a wide-spectrum cDNA probe capable of detecting HPV6, 11, 16, 18, 30, 31, 33, 35, 45, 51, 52. Forty-five tissue samples (50%) were immunohistochemically positive for p53. T-category, N-category, primary site of tumor, clinical stage and tumor differentiation did not correlate with p53 expression. Our finding that p53 overexpression occurred in 50% of head and neck tumor samples is similar to the frequency of p53 overexpression reported for both lung and esophageal cancer. The common risk factor is the same in these neoplasms, and therefore it is not surprising to find a similar percentage of p53 overexpression. The prevalence of metastasis was higher in the patients with p53-positive staining than in those with p53-negative staining (p < 0.10). Analysis of cumulative survival rates of patients by the Kaplan-Meier method showed a close correlation between p53 expression and survival time. The survival differences according to p53 immunostaining were significant (p 0.05). Our results indicate that p53 immunohistochemical evaluation may be useful as one of the new prognostic parameters in head and neck cancer patients. The HPV genomes were detected in 9 of 90 patients (10.0%); 8 of 9 patients with mesopharyngeal cancer and one with maxillary cancer, namely, 29.6% of mesopharyngeal cancers and 6.7% of maxillary cancer contained HPV DNA sequences. Seven of 8 patients had SCCs of tonsil origin. Almost all of the HPV infections in our study occurred in patients with mesopharyngeal cancer, and it has been suggested that this anatomic subsite may be more frequently infected by HPV than other sites within the head and neck region. Among the 27 patients with mesopharyngeal cancer, HPV DNA-positive patients experienced a higher incidence of complete remission than HPV DNA-negative patients (87.5% vs. 26.3%, p < 0.05)."
CD008054,0,19235847,1,Cervical infections by multiple human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes: Prevalence and impact on the risk of precancerous epithelial lesions.,"A large proportion of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections is sustained by multiple genotypes. The effect of multiple infections on the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and the potential efficacy of vaccine on these infections are controversial. We performed viral typing by SFP(10)-LIPA on a consecutive series of 1,323 women undergoing colposcopy, 69% of whom had cervical biopsy, and correlated CIN severity with the type and number of HPVs. Overall prevalence of HPV-DNA was 68.9%, 97.3% in CIN1, and 98.1% in CIN>/=2. HPV positivity correlated with younger age (35.9 vs. 37.3 years, P = 0.026) and history of CIN (P < 0.001). Multiple types were detected in 44.2% of cases, including 63.1% CIN1 and 80.8% CIN>/=2. Twenty-three different types were detected, HPV-16, 31 and 52 being the most frequent. Infections by HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 occurred in 59.4% of CIN1 and 71.3% of CIN>/=2. Number of viral types and class of oncogenic risk were linearly correlated with CIN severity (P < 0.0001) by univariate and multivariate analyses controlling for age and history of CIN. The effect of the number of HPV types was maintained after exclusion from the model of infections by HPV-6, 11, 16, and 18. Frequency, distribution, and clinical correlates of multiple HPV infections highlight the importance of assessing individual types in the management and the prediction of outcome of women with abnormal baseline cytology and point to potential limitations in current vaccine strategies."

Harlem Study Team.","Our objective is to describe the clinical findings from a nurse-practitioner-based breast and cervical cancer screening program for poor, elderly, black women. We designed a cross-sectional descriptive study set at an urban public hospital medical clinic. All women 65 years of age and older were eligible to be screened. We measured these main outcomes: rates of participation, abnormal tests, and neoplasia. Women were offered screening during a routine visit. Of 689 women, 491 (71%) participated. Mammography was completed by 66% of women; one had stage 1 cancer, and 76% were negative. Among the women (24%) with abnormal mammograms, the overwhelming majority were diagnosed with benign lesions. For ten of 450 women completing Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, results were suspicious or positive for malignancy, for a prevalence rate of 22.2/1,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.6/1,000 to 35.8/1,000). Three were subsequently designated falsely positive; five had confirmed cervical neoplasia; and two had other reproductive malignancies. Two women with negative smears also had neoplasia: one with vulvar cancer and one with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and cervical neoplasia, for a total of six cervical neoplasias. Interestingly, one-fifth of women with a hysterectomy had an intact cervix, including one with cervical neoplasia. Nearly one-third of women with abnormal Paps or mammograms failed to complete follow-up. Success of screening programs for the elderly will depend on the risk group targeted, careful examination, degree of sensitivity and specificity of the tests, and acceptability of follow-up diagnosis and treatment."

The preparations of the two methods were compared with respect to quality and to sensitivity for atypias. In addition the HPV status was determined on the same cell suspension in cases with borderline changes (BLC) and dysplasias including carcinoma using the Hybrid Capture System. The use of TLP reduced the proportion of suboptimal preparations by more than 50% (14.6% vs. 35%) and eliminated the only inadequate preparation registered in CS. The DSP detected more than twice as many dysplasias of all degrees as CS (3.4% vs. 1.4%) and reduced the proportion of BLC to one third (3.2% vs. 9.6%). The percentages of cases positive for high- and intermediate-risk HPV in preparations with BLC, LSIL and HSIL were 17, 62.5% and 100% respectively. The TL-method improves significantly the efficiency of PAP-smears and allows the typing of HPV which is of clinical importance for the management of low grade squamous intraepitelial lesions and borderline changes. The findings speak against the further use of CS for cervical screening."
CD008054,0,8747377,0,Image cytometry and chemoprevention in cervical cancer.,"Of the approximately 60 million Pap smears performed in the United States in 1995, about 8% or 5 million will show cytology that is ""not negative"" (ASCUS, AGCUS, LSIL, HSIL, etc.). Possibly 15% or about 0.7 million of these cases will have positive follow-up by repeated Pap smears, colposcopy or biopsy. More than 4 million will be false-positive smears based on the reference standard of biopsy or repeated smears. If no treatment or medical intervention was offered to the 0.7 million cytologically and histologically positive cases, perhaps 20,000 (3%) would develop into invasive cancer. Of the original 5 million cytologically ""not negative"" cases, fewer than 0.5% have the potential to develop into invasive cancer. While considerable attention has been paid to false-negatives in Pap screening, the above considerations indicate that the cytological and histological criteria for assessing the malignant potential of ""not negative"" samples might benefit from some refinement. Until such refinement occurs, any chemoprevention studies in cervix face a formidable signal-to-noise problem--worse than 1:30. This paper presents data from quantitative image cytometry of cervical smears for assessing the malignant potential of various ""not negative"" cases. We have approached this in two ways--by analyzing dysplastic cell nuclei and by analyzing the nuclei of cytologically normal cells growing in the vicinity of the neoplastic lesion. In both cases, nuclear features describing the distribution of the DNA in the cell nuclei (especially texture features) are the discriminating factors. Future research into the objective assessment of malignant potential of ""not negative"" cases is outlined."

Many aspects of the natural history of high-risk human papillomaviruses as sexually transmitted infections and as oncogenic agents have been researched. Although human papillomavirus diagnosis is largely confined to DNA detection techniques in cervical smears, there is accumulating evidence that the best polymerase chain reaction and hybrid capture techniques are more sensitive and probably of similar specificity compared with cervical cytology as a triage test for women with borderline smear abnormalities and for screening older women. This is strong presumptive evidence that high-risk human papillomavirus testing could be useful in cervical screening. Current research is aimed at establishing a place for high-risk human papillomavirus testing in routine screening practice. Randomised clinical trials, long-term natural history studies, mathematical modelling, and economic and psychosocial studies are being used to demonstrate whether this testing can improve both the effectiveness and efficiency of cervical screening in a range of situations."

The feasibility of studying oral HPV natural history was evaluated by collecting oral rinse samples on 2 occasions at a 6-month interval from 136 HIV-positive and 63 HIV-negative participants. Cervical vaginal lavage samples were concurrently collected for comparison. HPV genomic DNA was detected in oral and cervical samples by consensus primer PCR and type-specified for 37 HPV types. The six-month cumulative prevalence of oral HPV infection was significantly less than for cervical infection (p < 0.0001). HIV-positive women were more likely than HIV-negative women to have an oral (33 vs. 15%, p = 0.016) or cervical (78 vs. 51%, p < 0.001) infection detected. Oral HPV infections detected at baseline were as likely as cervical infections to persist to 6 months among HIV-negative (60% vs. 51%, p = 0.70) and HIV-positive (55% vs. 63%, p = 0.27) women. Factors that independently elevated odds for oral HPV persistence differed from cervical infection and included current smoking (OR = 8, 95% CI = 1.3-53), age above 44 years (OR = 20, 95% CI = 4.1-83), CD4 < 500 (OR = 6, 95% CI = 1.1-26), use of HAART therapy (OR = 12, 95% CI = 1.0-156), and time on HAART therapy (trend p = 0.04). The rate of oral HPV infections newly detected at follow-up was significantly lower than cervical infection among HIV-positive (p < 0.001) and HIV-negative women (p < 0.001). Our study not only demonstrates that it is feasible to study the natural history of oral HPV infection with oral rinse sampling, but also indicates that oral and cervical HPV natural history may differ."

The validity of this qualification for identification of patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was tested. One hundred twenty-four cytologic smears with squamous atypia were reviewed retrospectively by two cytopathologists blind to the colposcopy results. The smears were classified as favoring either reactive or premalignant/malignant processes. Subjective criteria used in the classification were based on the pathologists' experience. All patients underwent colposcopy and selected biopsy under the direction of a gynecologic oncologist. Of the 124 atypical smears, 69 were classified as favoring reactive processes and 55 as favoring premalignant/malignant processes by cytopathologist 1. Cytopathologist 2 classified 68 as reactive and 56 as premalignant/malignant. Colposcopy and selected biopsy revealed the following lesions: 34 cases of human papillomavirus (27.4%), 17 of CIN 1 (13.7%), 4 of CIN 2 (3.2%), 2 of CIN 3 (1.6%) and 67 without pathology (54.0%). All six patients with squamous atypia and underlying CIN 2 and 3 lesions had their cytology classified as premalignant/malignant by the cytopathologists. In these patients this qualification had high sensitivity (100%) and negative predictive value (100%). The 1991 Bethesda System classification above, when applied to patients with squamous atypia, was effective in identifying patients with serious pathologic cervical lesions. If used as a triage method, colposcopy should be reserved for atypical lesions classified as premalignant/malignant, potentially decreasing the cost of health care without decreasing the quality of that care."

CD008054,0,1314360,0,Repeated evaluation of human papillomavirus 16 status in cervical swabs of young women with a history of normal Papanicolaou smears.,"This study was designed to compare single-point prevalence estimates with a cumulative prevalence estimate of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 in cervical smears. The influence of the menstrual cycle and the long-term effect of HPV 16 positivity on the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were monitored. We examined 21 women (median age 23.6 years) every 5 weeks for 1 year. All women had a history of negative Papanicolaou smears for at least 5 years before enrollment. Cervical swabs were collected at each visit for Papanicolaou smears and HPV 16 detection by the polymerase chain reaction. Five years after completion of the last visit, self-reported information regarding cervical neoplasia was obtained. Human papillomavirus type 16 point-prevalence estimates per visit varied between 14.3-33.3%. The cumulative prevalence was 66.7%; 14 women were positive at least once and seven women were continuously negative for HPV 16. Detection of HPV 16 was significantly higher in the luteal phase. Repeated positivity for HPV 16 by Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction preceded and accompanied CIN in one patient, whereas in the remaining patients, positivity for HPV 16 by polymerase chain reaction alone was not associated with CIN during a 5-year follow-up. Single-point measurements of HPV 16 in cervical smears by polymerase chain reaction are of limited value for assessment of an individual's HPV status. This should be kept in mind when HPV testing for screening programs is considered."

CD008054,0,12605088,0,Biomarkers in diagnostic obstetric and gynecologic pathology: a review.,"Until recently, the histologic diagnosis of obstetrical and gynecologic neoplasia was based principally on morphologic criteria. However, interobserver reproducibility for entities such as squamous intraepithelial, endometrial, and trophoblastic disease varies widely between observers. This inherent variability in interpretation between individuals has led to wide ranges in diagnostic precision between practices, and in many cases, between recognized experts. The advent of immunohistochemistry, and the more recent accelerated discovery of new genes and their functions has resulted in the discovery of cellular proteins or nucleic acids that are differentially expressed in tumors. When applied in conjunction with existing histologic criteria, these ""biomarkers"" have the potential to enhance diagnostic consistency and reproducibility. The gains expected are to practicing diagnostic pathologists (who will enjoy greater diagnostic consistency) and to academics (for whom biomarkers may uncover new pathways unappreciated by histologic diagnosis alone). However, fundamental to the success in both arenas will be critical analysis of the potential pitfalls in immunohistochemistry, strict validation of new markers as they arrive in the field, and a realistic view of their value in the laboratory management of obstetrical and gynecologic diseases."

This is a review of many of the studies already published evaluating the utility of human papillomavirus testing as part of the triage for patients whose Papanicolaou smears were reported as ASCUS or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Two triage approaches for follow-up of such patients are presented, and recommendations are made as to which is most cost-effective and safe. Data related to human papillomavirus testing were obtained with both currently available commercial kits for detection of high-risk human papillomavirus and the polymerase chain reaction. There was variation in results reported, possibly related to populations studied. The approach to management by cytologic screening and colposcopy, when indicated, appeared over the long term to be equal to human papillomavirus testing. In our opinion current human papillomavirus testing is of little clinical use to the practitioner. Its use should be limited to appropriately designed and implemented research studies."

CD008054,0,8877195,0,Retroviral p15E-related serum factors and recurrence of head and neck cancer.,"Surgical removal of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) restores the defective monocyte polarization found in patients with HNSCC. Since HNSCC contain p15E-like low molecular weight factors < 25 kD (LMWF) capable of suppressing N-formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLP)-induced monocyte polarization, it is likely that HNSCC removal eradicates the production site of p15E-like factors. This report describes a prospective follow-up study on the levels of bioactive p15E-like serum factors for a period of 2 years in nine patients with HNSCC who had no recurrence and 11 patients with HNSCC who showed residual or recurrent disease after treatment. In the group of patients without recurrent disease p15E-like bioactivity gradually decreased and eventually became negative. In patients with recurrent/residual disease p15E-like bioactivity remained high or even became positive before or at the time of diagnosing tumour recurrence. This study strongly supports the concept that HNSCC tumours are the production site of p15E-like immuno-suppressive factors and indicates that serum p15E-like factors may be used for future studies on early serum markers for recurrent/residual disease developing in the first year after treatment."

A clinicopathologic study of 35 cases.,"We describe 35 peripheral lymph nodes classified as mantle cell/marginal zone B-cell hyperplasia with clear cells using morphologic and immunologic findings. For the purpose of this study, we obtained clinical follow-up information and performed immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies on paraffin sections by polymerase chain reaction. Architecturally, the nodes were suggestive of a benign process: no pericapsular infiltration, sinuses readily identified, scattered reactive follicles present, and paracortical nodular hyperplasia present. No monocytoid B cells were present. Focally, small lymphoid cells with round nuclei and clear cytoplasm (clear cells) formed monomorphic nodular, inverse follicular, and/or marginal zone patterns. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis revealed neither light chain restriction nor an aberrant B-cell phenotype. Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies showed a clonal band in 1 of 26 cases in which DNA was amplified. To ascertain the clinical relevance of this positive case, follow-up information was obtained 30 months after the initial biopsy; the 83-year-old woman was alive without treatment but had splenomegaly and bone marrow involvement by marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. The morphologic and immunologic criteria used for diagnosis of mantle cell/marginal zone B-cell hyperplasia with clear cytoplasm are valid; however, to rule out the possibility of occult lymphoma, immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies and clinical follow-up are necessary."

CD008054,0,18973271,0,Guidelines for human papillomavirus DNA test requirements for primary cervical cancer screening in women 30 years and older.,"Given the strong etiologic link between high-risk HPV infection and cervical cancer high-risk HPV testing is now being considered as an alternative for cytology-based cervical cancer screening. Many test systems have been developed that can detect the broad spectrum of hrHPV types in one assay. However, for screening purposes the detection of high-risk HPV is not inherently useful unless it is informative for the presence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3) or cancer. Candidate high-risk HPV tests to be used for screening should reach an optimal balance between clinical sensitivity and specificity for detection of high-grade CIN and cervical cancer to minimize redundant or excessive follow-up procedures for high-risk HPV positive women without cervical lesions. Data from various large screening studies have shown that high-risk HPV testing by hybrid capture 2 and GP5+/6+-PCR yields considerably better results in the detection of CIN 2/3 than cytology. The data from these studies can be used to guide the translation of high-risk HPV testing into clinical practice by setting standards of test performance and characteristics. On the basis of these data we have developed guidelines for high-risk HPV test requirements for primary cervical screening and validation guidelines for candidate HPV assays."
CD008054,0,10416613,0,Prognostic value of genomic alterations in invasive cervical squamous cell carcinoma of clinical stage IB detected by comparative genomic hybridization.,"The clinical behavior of invasive cervical carcinoma of clinical stage IB varies considerably in tumors presenting without regional lymph node metastases. The early identification of patients at higher risk for poor outcome may prove useful because these patients would benefit from aggressive adjuvant treatments. In this study, comparative genomic hybridization was applied to evaluate whether genomic aberrations have prognostic significance in cervical carcinoma. Genomic alterations were evaluated in 62 cervical carcinomas of clinical stage IB. DNA sequence losses were most prevalent at chromosomes 4q (53%), 3p (52%), 13q (45%), 4p (44%), Xq (44%), 5q (40%), 18q (37%), and 6q (35%). Several genomic alterations were associated with poor clinical outcome or metastasis. The total number of DNA aberrations/tumor (P < 0.02) and the number of DNA sequence losses/tumor (P < 0.04) were associated with disease-specific survival. 9p deletions were significantly more frequent in carcinomas with lymph node metastasis than in node-negative tumors (P < 0.03). Losses of chromosome 11p (P < 0.0001) and 18q (P < 0.01) were associated with poor prognosis in cervical carcinomas without lymph node metastasis. These data suggest that inactivation of tumor suppressor genes on chromosomes 9p, 11p, and 18q may play a role in the progression of cervical carcinoma."
CD008054,0,19786768,0,Noncolorectal malignancies in inflammatory bowel disease: more than meets the eye.,"In patients with Crohn's disease, the risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma is 20-40 times higher than the low background risk of the general population. In the subset of patients with longstanding small bowel lesions, the absolute risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma exceeds 1 per 100 patient-years after 25 years of follow-up and becomes equivalent to the risk of colorectal cancer. Growing evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of small bowel adenocarcinoma arising in inflammatory lesions of Crohn's disease is similar to that of colorectal cancer complicating chronic colonic inflammation (inflammation-dysplasia-cancer sequence). However, contrasting with the established endoscopic detection of colonic advanced neoplasias in patients with longstanding extensive colitis, there is no consensus at this time how to face the excess-risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma in patients at high risk. There are no specific clinical or imaging alert signs and endoscopic surveillance of the totality of the inflamed small bowel mucosa would suppose to perform repeated enteroscopies, with the potential limiting factor of stenosis. Very preliminary data suggest that chemoprevention with salicylates could be an alternative way for reducing the risk. Data from referral centers and from the CESAME cohort suggest that intestinal lymphomas may arise in the chronically inflamed segments in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Regarding nonintestinal lymphomas, it is now established that IBD patients treated with thiopurines have an excess risk of lymphomas, exhibiting in most cases pathological features of lymphomas associated with immunosuppression, including the frequent presence of EBV in neoplastic tissues. There is growing evidence that treatment with thiopurines is responsible by itself for this excess risk. IBD patients receiving immunomodulators, especially young men, are also at risk (0.4 for 10,000 patient-years in the CESAME study) for developing fatal early post-mononucleosis lymphomas, like in Purtilo's syndrome, maybe in association with a background genetic susceptibility. Finally, patients receiving thiopurines and/or TNF-inhibitors are at risk for developing fatal hepatosplenic T cell lymphomas, but this risk is low (no case in the CESAME study). Whether patients receiving a monotherapy with methotrexate and/or TNF inhibitors are at increased risk of lymphomas is not known. Concordant data suggest that women receiving immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for developing uterine cervix dysplasia and require closer surveillance. But it is not established whether the risk of uterine cervix cancer and basal and squamous cell skin cancers (that may be associated with chronic human papillomavirus infection) is increased in patients receiving immunomodulators."

Nevertheless, it is also important to ask ourselves how new health initiatives contribute, or fail to contribute, to major global undertakings such as achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). While reproductive health in general, and cervical cancer prevention in particular, are not explicitly mentioned among the MDGs, they are implied; and it is certain that women cannot contribute to sustainable development without good health.

One of genotypes 31.33, 35, 39, 52, 58, 59 was established in 8 and a combination of several genotypes of the virus--12 patients. Frequency of remission in CC patients associated with HPV type 16 who had survived 3 years was significantly higher than in the same category associated with HPV type 18 (p=0.03). Relapse frequency and mortality rates in patients with tumors associated with one of viruses 31.33, 35, 39, 52, 58 or 59 were higher as compared with HPV type 16--associated cases 2 years (p=0.03) or 3 years on (p=0.11), respectively. A similar trend was established for squamous-cell tumors stages 1 and 2 (p=0.07) (p=0.12), respectively. No difference was observed in efficacy of therapy for infection with one or a combination of several genotypes of high-risk HPV. Hence, the genotype of virus is believed to be a factor of prognosis in CC early cancers.

CD008054,0,12807940,0,Chapter 2: Natural history of anogenital human papillomavirus infection and neoplasia.,"This chapter suggests promising areas of future epidemiologic research on human papillomavirus (HPV) and anogenital cancer, organized around our understanding of cervical carcinogenesis. The major steps in cervical carcinogenesis include HPV infection, HPV persistence over a certain period of time, progression to precancer, and invasion. Backward steps include clearance of HPV infection and regression of precancer. Additional studies of incident HPV infections among virgins initiating sexual activity could clarify the earliest aspects of transmission and immune response. Research on older women and their male partners should focus on understanding the determinants of varying age-specific HPV prevalence curves and underlying dynamics of viral persistence, clearance, and latency. It will be particularly important for epidemiologists to define HPV persistence rigorously in order to guide clinical management and vaccine trials. Intensive longitudinal studies that collect visual, microscopic (cytologic and histologic), and molecular data will be needed to understand the fate of individual HPV infections and to clarify whether multiple, concurrent infections act independently on the cervix. Case-control designs will be useful mainly in searching for new biomarkers of risk of progression among HPV-infected women that could then be validated prospectively. Prospective confirmation is also needed for the etiologic cofactors established by case-control studies of invasive cervical cancer. Much of the knowledge about cervical cancer might apply to anal neoplasia. Epidemiologic studies of other genital tumors such as penile neoplasia are still needed, but multicentric groups must place great emphasis on measurement technology, given the difficulty in obtaining reliable comprehensive measurements."
CD008054,0,10499619,0,Patterns of p53 gene mutations in head and neck cancer: full-length gene sequencing and results of primary radiotherapy.,"p53 gene alterations are common in head and neck cancers, but their prognostic value has not been clearly established. Despite evidence in other cancers that sequencing of the entire p53 coding region provides prognostic information, full-length p53 gene sequencing has rarely been performed in head and neck cancers. In this study, p53 was assessed in a series of 42 pretreatment biopsies from patients with laryngeal carcinomas by full-length gene sequencing and by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Associations among p53 genotype, protein expression, and local recurrence were assessed in 35 irradiated patients followed for a minimum of 5 years. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsies, and exons 2-11 of the p53 gene were individually amplified by PCR and then directly sequenced. IHC was performed to detect mutant and wild-type p53 protein using the DO7 monoclonal antibody. p21 protein expression was assessed using the EA1 monoclonal antibody. Twenty genetic alterations were observed in 42 tumors (48%). Four of these alterations (20%) occurred outside exons 5-8. There was a significant association between p53 gene and protein status (chi2 = 4.18, P = 0.04), although the correlation was weak (phi coefficient = -0.327). Although local relapse following radiation was significantly associated with nodal status, no correlations were observed between p53 status (gene or IHC) and local recurrence following radiation therapy, based on the Kaplan-Meier method. These results show that p53 mutations are common in laryngeal carcinomas and that a proportion occur outside traditionally examined regions. The lack of correlation between p53 status and local control suggests that this marker is not as powerful as traditional prognostic factors, such as lymph node status."

CD008054,0,11958590,0,Cervical concentrations of interleukin-10 and interleukin-12 do not correlate with plasma levels.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infects the transformation zone of the cervix and is the primary cause of cervical cancer. The infection is localized to the cervix and mucosal immunity is likely to be an important determinant for viral clearance. Previous studies of immunity to HPV have measured immune markers in the blood, but the relationship of systemic immunity to cervical immunity is poorly understood. In this study of 70 women enrolled in the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS), a clinical trial for management of low-grade cytologic abnormalities of the cervix, we collected paired plasma and cervical secretions to investigate the relationship between cervical concentrations of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) and plasma levels. Neither IL-10 (p = 0.11), or IL-12 (p = -0.04) nor the ratio of IL-12 to IL-10 (p = 0.06) were correlated between blood and cervical secretions. Except for weak correlations of IL-10 among nonsmokers (p = 0.35. P = 0.019) and those in day 18-27 of their menstrual cycle (p = 0.51, P = 0.015), this lack of correlation persisted in all subgroups defined by genital inflammation or infection, current oral contraceptive use, heme contamination and volume of collected secretions, HPV16 seropositivity, and repeat HPV infection and/or cytologic abnormalities. The lack of correlation and high concentrations in cervical secretions indicate that the cervical IL-10 and IL-12 concentrations exceed what could be expected from blood as a principle source of IL-10 and IL-12 and suggest that cytokine concentrations in cervical secretions are predominantly the result of local cytokine production."
CD008054,0,9731867,0,Cervical screening adjuncts: recent advances.,"In an effort to reduce the false-negative rate of cervical cytologic findings, several new technologies have recently evolved. Automated cytologic testing (PapNet, AutoPap 300 QC) proposes to rescreen negative conventional cytologic findings to identify smears likely to be false negative. Fluid-based monolayers (ThinPrep, CytoRich) propose to reduce the false-negative rates by optimizing the collection and preparation of cells. Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing by Hybrid Capture has been proposed for a variety of screening and triage roles. Visual screening after application of acetic acid is done by cervicography by use of a photographic technique, whereas in speculoscopy the screening is done by direct visualization of the cervix by the primary care provider. Polarprobe uses biophysical parameters and a computer algorithm to give an instantaneous prediction of the likelihood of cervical disease. Each of these techniques, as well as the clinical experience with them, is reviewed. Current and possible future uses are discussed with regard to both clinical usefulness and cost-effectiveness."
CD008054,0,11770146,0,DNA analysis of laryngeal carcinoma cells by flow cytometry: the histoclinical factors and their significance.,"In patients suffering from several types of malignant tumours, changes in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content are usually associated with poorer survival prognosis. In the present study, DNA content and clinical and histopathologic features were analyzed in patients suffering from laryngeal carcinoma, with a view to establishing the crucial prognostic factors. In the 5-year follow-up study, flow cytometry was used to analyze DNA content in the paraffin-embedded samples of laryngeal carcinoma tissue obtained from 90 patients who had undergone surgical treatment in the Department of Otolaryngology, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland, in 1987 and 1988. The group consisted of 59 and 31 patients with T3 and T4 tumours, respectively. In each case, neck dissection was carried out either on one or both sides. Metastases in regional lymph nodes were found in 26 patients. The disease-free 5-year survival rate was 55.6%. Among the investigated cases, there were 14 aneuploid and 76 diploid tumours. The treatment yielded the worst results, when the S-phase fraction (SPF) and proliferative index (PI) were equal to or higher than 15.8% and 16.0%, respectively. The values of SPF and PI index did not correlate, however, with the frequency of regional metastases. Univariate analysis revealed that tumour size (T stage), presence of lymph node metastases, age of patients (< or = 60, > 60), tumour differentiation, tumour front grading (<15 points, > or = 15), mode of infiltration, SPF, and PI were positively correlated with the actual survival rate. Presence of lymph node metastases (p = .0001) and the PI (p = .0067) were found to be the only independent prognostic factors when the Cox multivariate analysis was applied. The assessment of the PI by flow cytometry may effectively facilitate the selection of patients recommended for a more aggressive treatment."

We retrospectively selected 105 samples from 100 patients with histologic diagnosis of CIN II-III with cytology immediately after LEEP with a first control post-LEEP between 2 and 6 months after treatment that included HPV determination, a minimal follow-up period of 12 months and maximum of 24 months, and at least 2 colpocytologic controls post-LEEP. In 71 of the 105 patients (67.6%), the determination was negative, finding the presence of HPV in 34 patients (32.4 %). Almost two-thirds of the patients had negative endocervical cytology and absence of HPV. During the follow-up, 20 P/R were detected, 16 (15.2%) of them being high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (7 CIN II and 9 CIN III). The combination of endocervical cytology and HPV determination in the remaining cervix seems to be a good strategy to predict the risk of SIL after conization. The probability of P/R can be estimated based on the results of these 2 variables. The negativity of HPV determination together with a negative endocervical cytology guarantees enough security and a favorable evolution."
CD008054,0,8744797,0,PCNA--a cell proliferation marker in vocal cord cancer. Part II: Recurrence in malignant laryngeal lesions.,"Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma constitutes the most frequent carcinoma found in the head and neck region. A precise prediction for recurrence potential cannot be done on site, treatment and histologic grading. Since Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) and DNA-cytometry have shown a good correlation between premalignant lesions and their progressive potential towards full-fledged carcinoma in the larynx as described in part I of this work, we have analyzed the PCNA index and DNA cytometry in specimen taken from vocal chord carcinomas with a 5-year follow-up, in order to assess its relationship with the presence or absence of tumour progression. 42 cases with (21) and without (2) recurrence have been examined. The DNA-index ranged from 1.01 to 1.43 (mean 1.10) in the group without and from 1.02 to 1.59 (mean 1.38) in the group with recurrent carcinoma (p = 0.002). The PCNA-index ranged from 0.00% to 18.90% (mean 6.97%) in the nonrecurrent group and from 0.00 to 3g.50% (mean 16.35%) in the patients with recurrence (p = 0.001). Both indices also correlated in a highly significant way. From these data emerges a highly significant correlation between the cytometric indices of cell proliferation and PCNA immunostaining. Furthermore the high correction between PCNA and DNA-index is of special interest for single case assessment. High DNA aberration and PCNA-index in vocal chord carcinoma may indicate a higher cellular aggressiveness of the tumour, resulting in a greater overall risk of metastases and local recurrences. Our results support the thesis that the indices of cellular proliferation within some cancers can define subsets of patients of high risk and help in isolating a population in which a more aggressive clinical protocol may be proposed."

CD008054,0,18945414,0,Epidemiology and prevention of human papillomavirus and cervical cancer in China and Mongolia.,"To develop a comprehensive intervention policy for future management of cervical cancer in China and Mongolia, it is essential to review the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, cervical cancer incidence and mortality, status of cervical screening and issues related to prophylactic HPV vaccines. Invasive cervical cancer (ICC) remains an important health problem among women in both China and Mongolia. However, a significant proportion of the burden is observed in rural settings. In areas of China and Mongolia where data are available, HPV prevalence is relatively high, with sexual activity being the most important risk factor. Nationwide programs for cervical cancer screening do not exist, and the majority of women have never been screened. However, government and non-governmental organizations have been collaborating to establish demonstration centers in both high- and low-resource settings to provide screening and obtain geographic specific data. To date, the prophylactic HPV vaccines are not licensed in China or Mongolia, although with wide coverage, the HPV vaccine could potentially prevent as much as three quarters of ICC cases among Chinese and Mongolian women. Ultimately, the introduction of HPV vaccination will present specific challenges, as well as opportunities, for developing advocacy, information and communication strategies that will involve policymakers and the general public."

CD008054,0,10714375,0,Cervical disease in women referred to colposcopy following inadequate smears.,The aim of this audit was to determine if inadequate cervical smears are associated with significant cervical pathology. Case records for 52 women with three consecutive inadequate smears referred for colposcopy to the Leicester Royal Infirmary (LRI) were retrieved. Sixteen women underwent large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was identified in six cases. There were no cases of inadequate smears initiating the diagnosis in 100 consecutive women with invasive cervical cancer. Inadequate smears are associated with high rates of treatment for a low yield of CIN. To reduce morbidity associated with colposcopy it may be acceptable to repeat an inadequate smear after 6 months rather than arranging immediate recall.
CD008054,0,18945411,0,Mathematical models of cervical cancer prevention in the Asia Pacific region.,"Using population-based and epidemiologic data for 25 countries in Asia (22 GAVI-Alliance eligible countries, Thailand, China and Japan), a model-based approach was used to estimate averted cervical cancer cases and deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (I$/DALY averted) for vaccination of young adolescent girls against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. Absolute reduction in lifetime cancer risk varied between countries, depending on incidence, proportion attributable to HPV-16 and -18, and population age-structure; for example, with 70% coverage, cancer reduction was 57% in Indonesia, whereas in Cambodia, it was 49%. Screening of women over age 30 three times per lifetime, after vaccinating them as pre-adolescents, is expected to provide an additional 20% to 30% mortality reduction. Of the 22 GAVI-Alliance eligible countries, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia account for 87% of the total DALYs averted. Assuming a cost per vaccinated girl of I$10 ($2 per dose), the cost per DALY averted is less than I$250 in 18 of 22 countries. Assuming a cost per vaccinated girl of I$25, the cost per DALY averted is I$1,360 in China compared with I$250 in Thailand, reflecting the greater number of girls that need to be vaccinated to prevent a death from cervical cancer in China. Vaccine price has an even greater effect on predicted affordability. For the 22 GAVI Alliance-eligible countries, vaccinating 5 consecutive birth cohorts at 70% coverage would cost over US $500 million versus almost US $1.3 billion at per dose costs of $2 and $5, respectively. Including China and Thailand would add US $251 million to US $1.4 billion at per dose prices of $2 and $12.25, respectively. In the countries we assessed, vaccination of young adolescent girls against HPV-16 and -18 could be very cost-effective if the cost per vaccinated girl is less than I$10-I$25; for it to be affordable, however, even with financing assistance, vaccine prices may need to be even lower."
CD008054,0,18945412,0,Human papillomavirus infection and cervical cancer prevention in Japan and Korea.,"Cervical cancer is a common cancer among women in Japan and Korea. Implementation of national cervical cancer screening programs has led to a reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer in both countries. However, over the past decade, there has been a recent marked increase in cervical cancer incidence among young women in Japan. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is found in the majority of cervical cancers, and HPV-16 and 18 are the two most common types. The next most frequent HPV types in cervical cancer are 52, 58 and 33 for Japan and 52, 58, and 33 for Korea, varying slightly when compared to the worldwide distribution. Screening coverage for both countries remains a challenge. Current coverage is reported at 24% in Japan, with the lowest coverage in young Japanese women, and 41% in Korea. Cytology remains the predominant screening method. HPV DNA testing is widely used to triage women with abnormal cytology in Korea. HPV vaccines have been licensed in Korea, but not yet in Japan. In both countries cost is a substantial impediment to implementation and no national programs are currently planned or in place. Therefore, increased disease awareness and utilization of screening is the first priority for controlling cervical cancer."

CD008054,0,20007387,1,Optimal threshold for a positive hybrid capture 2 test for detection of human papillomavirus: data from the ARTISTIC trial.,"We present data on the use of the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) test for the detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV) with different thresholds for positivity within a primary screening setting and as a method of triage for low-grade cytology. In the ARTISTIC population-based trial, 18,386 women were screened by cytology and for HPV. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia lesions of grade two and higher (CIN2+ lesions) were identified for 453 women within 30 months of an abnormal baseline sample. When a relative light unit/cutoff (RLU/Co) ratio of > or = 1 was used as the threshold for considering an HC2 result positive, 15.6% of results were positive, and the proportion of CIN2+ lesions in this group was 14.7%. The relative sensitivity for CIN2+ lesion detection was 93.4%. When an RLU/Co ratio of > or = 2 was used as the threshold, there was a 2.5% reduction in positivity, with an increase in the proportion of CIN2+ lesions detected. The relative sensitivity decreased slightly, to 90.3%. Among women with low-grade cytology, HPV prevalences were 43.7% and 40.3% at RLU/Co ratios of > or = 1 and > or = 2, respectively. The proportions of CIN2+ lesions detected were 17.3% and 18.0%, with relative sensitivities of 87.7% at an RLU/Co ratio of > or = 1 and 84.2% at an RLU/Co ratio of > or = 2. At an RLU/Co ratio of > or = 1, 68.3% of HC2-positive results were confirmed by the Roche line blot assay, compared to 77.2% of those at an RLU/Co ratio of > or = 2. Fewer HC2-positive results were confirmed for 35- to 64-year-olds (50.3% at an RLU/Co ratio of > or = 1 and 63.2% at an RLU/Co ratio of > 2) than for 20- to 34-year-olds (78.7% at an RLU/Co ratio of > or = 1 and 83.7% at an RLU/Co ratio of > 2). If the HC2 test is used for routine screening as an initial test or as a method of triage for low-grade cytology, we would suggest increasing the threshold for positivity from the RLU/Co ratio of > or = 1, recommended by the manufacturer, to an RLU/Co ratio of > or = 2, since this study has shown that a beneficial balance between relative sensitivity and the proportion of CIN2+ lesions detected is achieved at this threshold."

Sixty-two women with cervical or endometrial cancer treated with radiotherapy were included in the study. According to the CTCAEv3.0 scale, 22 patients showed late adverse radiotherapy reactions (grade 2 or more). PCR on lymphocyte DNA followed by automated fragment analysis was performed to examine the number of tandem repeat units at each locus. No significant association was found between the repeat length at any of the microsatellites in XRCC1, XRCC3 or XRCC5 and the incidence of late radiotherapy complications. Since higher odds ratios (ORs) were found for the rare XRCC1 [AC]11 and [AC]21 repeats (OR = 2.65, P = 0.325 and OR = 8.67, P = 0.093, respectively), the possible involvement of these small and large repeats in clinical radiosensitivity cannot be completely ruled out. When specific numbers of repeats were examined, no significant correlation was found between the microsatellite repeat length in XRCC1 and XRCC5 and cancer incidence. A weak correlation between XRCC3 [AC]16 homozygotes and cancer incidence was found (OR = 2.56, P = 0.055). A large-scale multicenter study of cancer patients with a high number of radiosensitive individuals is needed to clarify the value of rare polymorphic microsatellite repeats in XRCC1 and XRCC3 as a biomarker of clinical radiosensitivity or increased cancer risk."

We discuss the genetic profile of the thyroid tumor in which a large somatic deletion of APC gene was found and the physiopathology of thyroid carcinoma in patients with germline APC mutation.

CD008054,0,19880826,0,"Detection of genomic amplification of the human telomerase gene TERC, a potential marker for triage of women with HPV-positive, abnormal Pap smears.","The vast majority of invasive cervical carcinomas harbor additional copies of the chromosome arm 3q, resulting in genomic amplification of the human telomerase gene TERC. Here, we evaluated TERC amplification in routinely collected liquid based cytology (LBC) samples with histologically confirmed diagnoses. A set of 78 LBC samples from a Swedish patient cohort were analyzed with a four-color fluorescence in situ hybridization probe panel that included TERC. Clinical follow-up included additional histological evaluation and Pap smears. Human papillomavirus status was available for all cases. The correlation of cytology, TERC amplification, human papillomavirus typing, and histological diagnosis showed that infection with high-risk human papillomavirus was detected in 64% of the LBC samples with normal histopathology, in 65% of the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)1, 95% of the CIN2, 96% of the CIN3 lesions, and all carcinomas. Seven percent of the lesions with normal histopathology were positive for TERC amplification, 24% of the CIN1, 64% of the CIN2, 91% of the CIN3 lesions, and 100% of invasive carcinomas. This demonstrates that detection of genomic amplification of TERC in LBC samples can identify patients with histopathologically confirmed CIN3 or cancer. Indeed, the proportion of TERC-positive cases increases with the severity of dysplasia. Among the markers tested, detection of TERC amplification in cytological samples has the highest combined sensitivity and specificity for discernment of low-grade from high-grade dysplasia and cancer."
CD008054,0,19375565,0,Colposcopy to evaluate abnormal cervical cytology in 2008.,"The rates of cervical cancer in the United States are low in comparison with developing nations. Whereas the Papanicolaou smear has performed well in terms of detecting both precursors of squamous cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, this test has been less successful at identifying those women with the highest-risk premalignant disease. The use of human papillomavirus testing has also contributed to the improved sensitivity of screening for cervical cancer. In light of this, the colposcopy clinic retains high referral rates yet has poor diagnostic accuracy. Unfortunately, patients are triaged to follow-up for abnormal Papanicolaou smears based on algorithms that rely on the less evidence-based techniques of colposcopy. Therefore, the need to improve the specificity of colposcopic-guided biopsy remains. The colposcopic procedure is highlighted in this review and evaluated in terms of current literature on technique, the colposcopic impression, cervical biopsy, and methods proposed to enhance appreciation of the highest-risk lesions. By outlining certain flaws in technique and discussing the proposal of new tests to supplement the current standard of care, this review aimed to highlight the need for future research to maintain sensitivity but improve the specificity of colposcopy."

The in vitro production of interleukin-2 by T-helper (Th) cells in response to the C-terminal and N-terminal domains of the HPV-16 E2 protein was determined in 74 women with cytological evidence of premalignant cervical epithelial neoplasia who participated in a non-intervention follow-up (FU) study. Cross-sectional analysis at the end of FU showed that Th cell responses against the C-terminal domain were associated with evidence of previous or present HPV-16 infection as compared to patients with no evidence of any HPV infection (18.9% versus 0%, P = 0.039). Th cell responses against the N-terminal domain were not associated with evidence of HPV-16 infection. No association with disease outcome was observed with Th cell responses against either of the E2 protein domains. However, longitudinal analysis revealed that Th cell responses against the C-terminal domain frequently occur at the time of virus clearance. Whether these responses are responsible for the clearance of the virus is not known."

CD008054,0,11105418,0,The planning of cervical cancer screening programmes in eastern Europe: is viral testing a suitable alternative to smear testing?,"Cervical cancer screening with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing has potential advantages over conventional, smear testing in that it can predict cases in which invasive cancers are more likely to develop, may be cheaper to implement and improve compliance. In areas of the world where little formalized cervical cancer screening takes place, or where health resources are limited, HPV testing has been suggested as a possible alternative for primary screening. In this paper we demonstrate the use of mathematical modelling to evaluate the effects of setting up screening programmes in Eastern Europe with HPV DNA testing as the primary screening tool and compare it with conventional smear testing. The impact of screening is measured in terms of the life years gained and the resulting resource usage and cost. We investigate several screening options with different screening intervals and age ranges for the target population."
CD008054,0,8784097,0,"ret/PTC-1, -2, and -3 oncogene rearrangements in human thyroid carcinomas: implications for metastatic potential?","The ret/PTC oncogene is unique to papillary thyroid cancer. Three forms of this oncogene, formed by translocation of three different genes to the tyrosine kinase domain of the ret protooncogene, result in constitutive kinase activation. Correlation with clinical outcome is controversial; ret/PTC-1 has been suggested to predict aggressive behavior. There is no morphological description of ret/PTC-positive tumors. We analyzed 60 thyroid carcinomas for ret/PTC expression to determine correlation with clinical history, disease stage, or tumor morphology. Ribonucleic acid extracted from frozen tissue was reverse transcribed; PCR was performed to amplify ret/PTC-1, 2, and -3. The TPC-1 cell line was the positive control for ret/PTC-1. All tumors were characterized morphologically. Clinical data were collected. The 57 papillary and 3 follicular carcinomas were resected from 44 female patients and 15 males. The average age at diagnosis was 46.2 yr (range. 24-83 yr). Three patients had a history of neck irradiation. At diagnosis, 11 patients had extrathyroidal tumor extension, 20 had lymph node metastases, and 1 had lung metastasis. Thirteen patients had tall cell papillary carcinomas; 3 tumors had focal insular or anaplastic dedifferentiation. The average follow-up was 13.4 months, during which 4 patients had recurrent disease. No deaths occurred. One papillary carcinoma (1.7%) was positive for ret/PTC-1, none was positive for ret/PTC-2, and 2(3.4%) were positive for ret/PTC-3. Although all 3 patients who had tumors containing ret/PTC rearrangements were under the age of 45 yr (range, 26-44 yr) and had small tumors (< 1.2 cm), 2 of these 3 patients presented with lymph node metastases, and the third had lymphatic invasion. ret/PTC oncogene expression did not correlate with radiation history. In summary, ret/PTC oncogene rearrangements were found in 3 of 60 (5%) thyroid carcinomas and were not present in tumors with aggressive morphological features. However, we found ret/PTC rearrangements in young patients (< 45 yr of age) with small thyroid carcinomas showing a predisposition for lymphatic involvement, suggesting a possible role in the development of this subgroup of tumors."
CD008054,0,20007673,1,Impact of improved classification on the association of human papillomavirus with cervical precancer.,"Misclassification of exposure and surrogate endpoints of disease can obscure causal relations. Using data from the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study (ALTS, 1997-2001), the authors explored the impact of exposure (human papillomavirus (HPV) detection) and endpoint (histologic cervical precancer) classification on their mutual association. Women referred into this study with an atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance Papanicolaou test with satisfactory results for all 4 HPV tests were included in this analysis (n = 3,215; 92.2%). HPV testing results were related to different definitions of cervical precancer, based on paired, worst 2-year histologic diagnoses, by calculating clinical sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratios. The authors found that HPV test sensitivity increased and specificity decreased with increasing certainty of cervical precancer, with HPV testing having the highest sensitivity (92%-98%) and lowest specificity (46%-54%) for consensus cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3). The overall accuracy of each HPV test, as measured by odds ratios, was greatest for consensus CIN-3 diagnoses, from 2- to 4-fold greater than for a less stringent precancer definition of any diagnosis of CIN 2 or more severe. In summary, there was convergence of greater certainty of carcinogenic HPV with greater certainty of a precancerous diagnosis, such that all 4 HPV tests almost always tested positive in women most likely to have cervical precancer. Finding increasingly strong associations when both test and diagnostic misclassification are reduced is a useful sign of ""true association"" in molecular epidemiology."
CD008054,0,18175557,0,[Detection of HPV DNA presence in lymph nodes as predictive factor in cervical carcinoma patients].,"The presence of DNA of human papillomavirus (HPV DNA) in cervical cancers varies widely from 60 to 99%. It depends on the HPV detection method, the quality of the investigated material and the population covered. Hence, the significance of the presence of HPV DNA in the primary lesion is still under discussion. There is also a problem with HPV positive cases in histopathologically negative lymph nodes. Lymph node status is considered to be the most important prognostic factor after FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage. It is suggested that lymph node involvement reduces 5-year survival rate by 25 60%, within stages (except IA). However, the influence of lymph node HPV DNA positivity remains unclear. Numerous pathological parameters affecting survival rate are also recognized. Well established prognostic parameters could allow definition of the most suitable treatment. On the basis of recent results the presence of HPV DNA in lymph nodes is an early symptom of metastasis and could predict poor prognosis. We conclude that the presence of HPV DNA in lymph nodes is an early symptom of metastasis and should be treated as such in the follow up and planning the therapeutic strategy."

This paper looks at the current definition, diagnostic methods and management of AIN. The incidence of AIN has increased significantly in the last decades. The groups at risk are mainly patients with infection with human immunodeficiency virus, immunossuppressed patients and patients affected by HPV related diseases (e.g., cervical cancer or anal condyloma). Accurate diagnosis of AIN lesions consists of accurate grading and disease extension. Low grade AIN (AIN I) or in extensive lesions, follow-up is advised to determine the possible evolution to anal squamous cell carcinoma. In cases of more severe and localized lesions (AIN II and AIN III), surgical resection should be considered if the predictive postoperative morbidity is low. Screening programs for AIN are not currently in place and there might be much effort to study the management of HPV in these patients."

The results of the molecular-biological investigations were correlated with the known clinical prognostic parameters after a follow-up period of approximately 3 years. Methylation of the promoter region and LOH were the main mechanisms of p16 inactivation. Point mutations presented as rare events. An inactivation of p16 did not have any statistical influence on tumor prognosis. Patients with a p16 gene inactivated by promoter methylation appeared to have a slightly lower tendency for local and regional recurrences. The inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene p16 plays a role in the carcinogenesis of head and neck cancer."

Department of Veterans Affairs Laryngeal Study Group.,"Abnormal DNA content of cancer cells in a primary tumor is thought to reflect the altered proliferative capacity of that cancer and overall patient prognosis. Recently, increased DNA content has been associated with early tumor recurrence in patients with advanced laryngeal cancer. To determine if DNA content correlates with a tumor's metastatic behavior, 94 previously untreated patients with stage III (n = 54) or stage IV (n = 40) squamous carcinoma of the larynx were prospectively studied. The adjusted DNA index (aDI) of the primary tumor was measured by computerized cytomorphometry, and correlations with regional metastases, number of positive nodes, extracapsular spread, and pattern of relapse were determined. Median follow-up was 35 months. Of 94 patients, 73 underwent neck dissection. Positive nodes were found in 51 patients (70%) and three or more positive nodes were found in 31 patients (42%). High aDI (> .024) was significantly associated with the presence and number of histologically positive nodes (P = .016). Among patients with high aDI, 19 (50%) of 38 had three or more nodes positive compared to 12 (21%) of 56 of those with low aDI. Median aDI levels in patients with three or more nodes were significantly higher than in patients with 1 or 2 nodes (P = .003). Time to recurrence was shorter in patients with high aDI (P = .0078). These findings provide further evidence that increased DNA content is associated with more aggressive laryngeal cancers having high rates of multiple lymph node metastases and worse overall prognosis."

CIN grading is however subjective and affected by substantial rates of discordance among pathologists, which may lead to overtreatment. To minimise this problem, a histology review of CIN lesions by a consensus panel of pathologists is often used. Diffuse strong p16(INK4a) immunostaining has been proposed to aid the identification of true high-grade cervical lesions (ie, CIN2/3)."

CD008054,0,11920620,0,Human papillomavirus 16 load in normal and abnormal cervical scrapes: an indicator of CIN II/III and viral clearance.,"The relation between human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) viral load in cervical scrapes and development of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN II or III) was studied in a nested case-control study of women with normal cytology (group A) and in a cohort of women with abnormal cytology (group B). HPV 16 DNA load was determined using a quantitative real-time PCR assay. In group A, case women (women with CIN II/III, n = 12) had a significantly higher viral load than control women (women with CIN < or = I, n = 47). This resulted in an increased relative risk of women with the 50% highest viral load for development of CIN II/III (OR 7.7; CI 1.6-33). In group B, women with CIN II/III (n = 38) had a significantly higher viral load than women with CIN < or = I (n = 25). Women with the 50% highest viral load had an increased relative risk of CIN II/III (OR 3.2; CI 1.1-9.3) and a decreased chance of both viral clearance and cytologic regression. Our data suggest that in women with normal cytology an increased HPV 16 load confers an increased risk of developing a CIN lesion. A sustained high viral load is subsequently informative for progression to a high-grade CIN lesion."

The ThinPrep Imaging System (TIS) has been widely adopted primarily for this reason for use on ThinPrep Pap tests (TPPT). However, TIS may also influence the interpretation of Pap tests, leading to changes in the frequency of various interpretive categories. The effect of the TIS on rates of TPPT interpretation as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) is of concern because any shift in the frequency of ASC-US will alter the sensitivity and specificity of the Pap test. We have sought to determine whether automated screening of TPPT has altered ASC-US rates in our institution when compared with manual screening (MS) of TPPT."

CD008054,0,11280716,0,A large family with hereditary MTC: role of RET genetic analysis in differential diagnosis between MEN 2A and FMTC.,"Germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene cause three different cancer syndromes: multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN 2B) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). In the absence of biochemical and/or clinical evidence of pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism, patients with MEN 2A disease display the same phenotype of FMTC disease, although prognosis and clinical management in both affected and unaffected familial members are quite different. We studied a family with hereditary MTC, whose proband was referred to us because of enlarged cervical nodes and increased calcitonin serum levels 28 years after the total thyroidectomy for MTC. Cervical node dissection was carried out and subsequently the presence of MTC metastasis was histologically confirmed. A RET genomic mutation at codon 634 (TGC-->TTC) was identified in the proband and in seven out of 19 familial members studied. Accordingly, a hereditary disease was suggested. However, the strong association of RET mutation at codon 634 with the presence of pheochromocytoma in MEN 2 disease suggested a more rigorous management in all gene carriers. Indeed, during the follow-up pheochromocytoma was subsequently identified in the proband. This finding suggests that all families with a pedigree suggestive of FMTC should be regarded at risk from MEN 2A disease, at least when a critical mutation in the RET cysteine domain is detected."
CD008054,0,17672042,0,Human papillomavirus infection and disease in the HIV+ individual.,"HPV infection of both the genital tract and oral cavity of HIV+ men and women is increased. HPV-related pathology is also increased in the HIV+ individuals, usually with further increases seen for those HIV+ individuals with lower CD4 cell counts. Fortunately, the rates of cervical cancer and anal cancer are relatively low and not related to CD4 cell count. Treatment of the HIV+ individual with HPV-related disease is challenging and requires close long-term follow-up to prevent recurrent disease. The mechanism of how HPV and HIV interact is still not known but is more likely to be linked to immune suppression rather than a direct interaction between viruses. The newly developed HPV vaccines will likely have a significant impact on HPV-related disease in immunocompetent individuals. It remains to be seen what impact these vaccine will have on the immune depressed."

CD008054,0,11673826,1,High-risk HPV testing in women with borderline and mild dyskaryosis: long-term follow-up data and clinical relevance.,"In The Netherlands and most other European countries, women with two serial cervical smears with borderline or mild dyskaryosis (BMD) within 6 months are referred for colposcopy-directed biopsies. Only about 10% of these women have high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). This study therefore investigated whether human papillomavirus (HPV) testing could identify which women with smears read as BMD are most likely to have high-grade CIN, either at referral or during follow-up and the relationship was determined between clearance of high-risk HPV and regression of abnormal cytology. Women with smears read as BMD (n=278) were referred to the gynaecologist for colposcopy. They were subdivided into two groups; group A comprised women with a single smear (n=172) and group B women with two sequential smears (n=106) read as BMD before referral. High-risk HPV detection with Hybrid Capture II (HC II) was performed on a cervical scrape taken at the first visit before colposcopy (i.e. baseline smear) and during follow-up. Biopsies were taken when lesions suspected for CIN were seen at colposcopy. High-risk HPV DNA was present in the baseline smears of 126 (45.0%) women; 26 (20.6%) of them had histologically confirmed CIN 2/3 at the first visit and another 14 (11.1%) during follow-up. Only one of the 152 women (0.7%) with a negative high-risk HPV test had a CIN 2 lesion at the first visit and no CIN lesions were detected during follow-up of these women. After exclusion of women who were treated for prevalent high-grade CIN, the median follow-up times were 1.3 years (range 0.0-4.3 years) and 1.6 years (range 0.0-4.5 years) for women with HPV-negative and HPV-positive baseline smears, respectively. The sensitivity of a positive high-risk HPV test for CIN 2/3 at the first visit was 96.3%, the specificity 60.2%, the positive predictive value 20.6%, and the negative predictive value 99.3%. These values did not change markedly when stratified for group A or group B. Thus, a high-risk HPV positive test was strongly associated with the presence at the first visit and the development of CIN 2/3 lesions during follow-up. Moreover, regression of abnormal cytology in women with a positive high-risk HPV test at baseline was strongly associated with viral clearance and occurred 0.3 years (range -1.2 to 1.7 years) later than HPV clearance. This study establishes the value of a high-risk HPV positive test for women at risk of high-grade CIN, with virtually no risk for missing CIN 2/3. Addition of a test on high-risk HPV in women with BMD could prevent 55% of the referrals and/or repeat smears."
CD008054,0,17117182,0,High sustained efficacy of a prophylactic quadrivalent human papillomavirus types 6/11/16/18 L1 virus-like particle vaccine through 5 years of follow-up.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancers, precancerous dysplasia, and genital warts. We report data for the longest efficacy evaluation to date of a prophylactic HPV vaccine. In total, 552 women (16-23 years) were enrolled in a randomised, placebo-controlled study of a quadrivalent HPV 6/11/16/18 L1 virus-like-particle vaccine with vaccination at months 0, 2, and 6. At regular intervals through 3 years, subjects underwent gynaecologic examination, cervicovaginal sampling for HPV DNA, serum anti-HPV testing, and Pap testing, with follow-up biopsy as indicated. A subset of 241 subjects underwent two further years of follow-up. At 5 years post enrollment, the combined incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection or disease was reduced in vaccine-recipients by 96% (two cases vaccine versus 46 placebo). There were no cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related precancerous cervical dysplasia or genital warts in vaccine recipients, and six cases in placebo recipients (efficacy = 100%; 95% CI:12-100%). Through 5 years, vaccine-induced anti-HPV geometric mean titres remained at or above those following natural infection. In conclusion, a prophylactic quadrivalent HPV vaccine was effective through 5 years for prevention of persistent infection and disease caused by HPV 6/11/16/18. This duration supports vaccination of adolescents and young adults, which is expected to greatly reduce the burden of cervical and genital cancers, precancerous dysplasia, and genital warts."

The extent and nature of this influence, however remains largely unknown. We therefore undertook a retrospective analysis of patients with carcinoma of the cervix at a tertiary referral centre in an African setting where HIV prevalence is high. There were 271 patients seen during a period of 1 year. Of these, 45 of the 206 tested were HIV infected (21.8%). The corresponding HIV prevalence for antenatal attendees was 38.7% in the region. The HIV-infected patients had lower mean haemoglobin levels and body mass indices than the HIV-non-infected women and were on average 13 years younger (p < 0.001), but otherwise did not differ with respect to demographics or disease parameters. They were, however, less likely to complete planned treatment. CD4 counts were below 200 in only 6 (21%) of 29 women tested. HIV-infected women in the African setting present with carcinoma of the cervix at a younger age, but the same disease stage as HIV-non-infected women, and without evidence of advanced immunocompromise.

Opportunities for research on cancer prevention in LMIC include investigating specific circumstances of exposure to known carcinogens and to agents which are not prevalent in other regions, as well as interactions among carcinogens and between genetic and environmental factors. Early detection both by screening and early clinical diagnosis represents an important component of cancer control in LMIC. Research has been carried out to identify effective and sustainable approaches for early detection of cervical cancer through human papillomavirus testing and visual tests and of oral cancer through visual inspection. For other important neoplasms such as breast cancer, on the other hand, no effective low-cost screening methods are currently available.

CD008054,0,12920476,0,Regulation of cell cycles is of key importance in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical carcinogenesis.,"The rapid progress in molecular biology has allowed the identification of the genes involved in different functions of normal cells and has also improved our understanding of the mechanisms of human carcinogenesis. The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a small double-stranded DNA tumor virus and its genes can manipulate cell cycle control to promote viral persistence and replication. The E6 and E7 proteins of high-risk HPV bind to cell cycle regulatory proteins and interfere with both G1/S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints much more effectively than the low-risk HPV. The difference between the ability of low and high-risk HPV types to induce immortalization and transformation may well lie in their abilities to interact with the various cell cycle components, resulting in the loss of multiple cell cycle checkpoints, which are important in host genome fidelity, thus potentially resulting in accumulation of genetic abnormalities. Cervical cancer is one of the leading malignancies in women worldwide, with substantial morbidity and mortality. According to current concepts, HPV is recognized as the single most important causal agent in the pathogenesis of this cancer. HPV infection clearly precedes the development of malignancy, while being regularly associated with cervical cancer precursor lesions (all grades of squamous intraepithelial lesions). HPV-infected low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) has three possible outcomes: a) it may regress; b) it can persist; or c) it can make a clinical progression to in situ or invasive carcinoma. It has been well established by prospective cohort studies that the spontaneous regression rate increases in parallel with follow-up duration. In contrast, the clinical progression of lesions usually takes place quite rapidly, i.e. during the first two years from diagnosis. The mechanisms responsible for this divergent clinical behavior of HPV-associated squamous intraepithelial lesions are largely unknown, but currently under intense study in different laboratories worldwide."

CD008054,0,11085523,0,A prospective study showing long-term infection with human papillomavirus 16 before the development of cervical carcinoma in situ.,"Human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) is a predominant cause of cervical neoplasia. However, no population-based study with long-term follow-up has clarified the temporal relationship between HPV16 infection and occurrence of carcinoma in situ, or the importance of recurrent or persistent infection. This nested case-control study was carried out in a population-based cohort of women participating in cytological screening whose initial smear, taken in 1969-1995, was normal. During up to 26 years of follow-up, carcinoma in situ was diagnosed in 484 eligible women. Archival smears from these women were compared with smears from 619 individually matched controls. After DNA extraction, a highly sensitive PCR system was used to detect HPV16. Among case women, the prevalence of HPV16 positivity was 56% at the time of diagnosis. The relative risk of cervical carcinoma in situ increased from 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-11.0) 13 years before diagnosis to 11.1 (95% confidence interval, 5.5-22.2) 1 year before diagnosis. Having a positive smear at entry to the cohort increased risk >5-fold, whereas having persistent infection with HPV in two subsequent smears increased risk 30-fold. We estimated that among HPV16-positive women, the median incubation period from infection to carcinoma in situ was 7-12 years. We conclude that evidence of persistent and/or recurrent infection is associated with a drastically higher risk of cervical carcinoma in situ than occasional infection with HPV16."

Radiotherapy for head and neck cancers has been examined as a possible risk factor for second primary cancers, but the results have been equivocal. We evaluated the impact of therapeutic radiation for oral cancer on the risk of second primary cancers with data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program for 1973-1999. Among 30,221 first primary oral squamous cell carcinoma patients, 6163 (20.4%) patients developed a second primary cancer, 5042 of which were metachronous. Patients treated with radiation only (RR=1.64, 95%CI=1.18-2.29) or radiation with surgery (RR=1.49, 95%CI=1.07, 2.06) had elevated risks of developing a second primary tumor, whereas patients treated with surgery only did not appear to be at increased risk (RR=1.28, 95%CI=0.93, 1.76). Consistent with an expected latent period between radiation exposure and tumor occurrence, radiation became a risk factor after 10 years of follow-up for solid cancers of the oral cavity (RR=2.8, 95%CI=1.5, 5.2), pharynx (RR=5.9, 95%CI=1.7, 20.7), esophagus (RR=3.9, 95%CI=1.1, 13.4) and lung (RR=1.5, 95%CI=1.0, 2.4), and after 1-5 years of follow-up for second primary leukemia (RR=2.5, 95%CI=1.0, 6.7).

Primary prevention is now possible via immunization with highly efficacious HPV vaccines, and secondary prevention has gained impetus with the advent of sensitive HPV-DNA testing to improve traditional Pap cytology screening programs. Although universal vaccination of teenagers and young women is a desirable policy, cost remains a key obstacle.

Type of HPV is the same in patients infected -or not- by the HIV (in patients with the same criteria of HIV infection). However, there is a higher rate of persistent HPV infections in HIV+ patients, especially with oncogenic virus subtypes. Persistence of high-risk virus is necessary for the development of dysplasic lesions: therefore, there is a higher incidence of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasias (CIN) and cervical cancers in HIV+ patients. In 1993, the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) designated invasive cervical carcinoma as a defining condition of AIDS. After conservative treatment in CIN, the recurrence rate is higher, together with a high rate of positive margins. It may he of some interest to perform a medical treatment, in association with the dysplasia surgical procedure. Invasive cancers have a worse pronostic than in HIV- patients, due to the specific aggressiveness of cervical carcinomas in seropositive patients. Standard treatment consists in surgery and radiotherapy with or without cisplatin chemotherapy, depending on the stage. This treatment is modulated according to CD4 rate. Antiviral treatment and infectious prophylaxis have to be reinforced. A special care will be required for radiotherapy technical execution and clinical (digestive) and hematological follow-up through out the treatment."

The earliest and most marked increases in young women occurred in England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia. Mortality rates in young women from eastern European countries began to increase later than in the UK, but the increases are of concern because baseline mortality rates are high in these countries. The reasons for the overall decline in cervical cancer are largely unknown but appear to be linked to improvements in the general standard of living. The increases in young women may well be due to the increasing prevalence of HPV infection. Screening for cervical cancer has undoubtedly led to a decline in cervical cancer incidence and mortality in many countries, but its contribution to the trends is difficult to assess without further information."
CD008054,0,11489758,0,"Alcoholism and risk for cancer of the cervix uteri, vagina, and vulva.","We conducted a population-based cohort study to analyze the risk of developing cancers of the female genitals among 36,856 patients with a hospital discharge diagnosis of alcoholism (ICD-7: 307, 322; ICD-8: 291, 303; ICD-9: 291, 303, 305A) in Sweden between 1965 and 1995. The follow-up was done by linkages of national registries. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed based on nationwide specific cancer rates. The first year of follow-up was excluded from all analyses to minimize the impact of selection bias. We found that alcoholic women had excess risks for in situ cervical cancer (SIR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6-1.9), for invasive cervical cancer (SIR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.4-3.5), and for cancer of the vagina (SIR, 4.6; 95% CI, 2.2-8.5) but not for cancer of the vulva (SIR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.4-2.0). The fact that alcoholics had an excess risk also for the in situ cancer suggests that the observed excess in invasive cervical cancer may not only be attributable to less use of Pap smear screening among them. The alcoholic women may be at higher risk for the progression from human papillomavirus infection to a malignant lesion for lifestyle-related reasons (promiscuity, smoking, use of contraceptive hormones, and dietary deficiencies). We conclude that alcoholic women are at high risk for in situ and invasive cervical cancer and for cancer of the vagina."

CD008054,0,18364507,0,Rapid clearance of human papillomavirus and implications for clinical focus on persistent infections.,"Health professionals and the public need to understand the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections of the cervix to best use the information provided by new molecular screening tests. We investigated outcomes of 800 carcinogenic HPV infections detected in 599 women at enrollment into a population-based cohort (Guanacaste, Costa Rica). For individual infections, we calculated cumulative proportions of three outcomes (viral clearance, persistence without cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse [CIN2+], or persistence with new diagnosis of CIN2+) at successive 6-month time points for the first 30 months of follow-up. Cervical specimens were tested for carcinogenic HPV genotypes using an L1 degenerate-primer polymerase chain reaction method. Infections typically cleared rapidly, with 67% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 63% to 70%) clearing by 12 months. However, among infections that persisted at least 12 months, the risk of CIN2+ diagnosis by 30 months was 21% (95% CI = 15% to 28%). The risk of CIN2+ diagnosis was highest among women younger than 30 years with HPV-16 infections that persisted for at least 12 months (53%; 95% CI = 29% to 76%). These findings suggest that the medical community should emphasize persistence of cervical HPV infection, not single-time detection of HPV, in management strategies and health messages."

Tobacco smoke contains a number of carcinogens that cause various kinds of damage to DNA. In this study, we simultaneously measured benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-induced DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations by the comet assay and the mutagen sensitivity assay, respectively, in cultured primary lymphocytes from newly recruited 123 patients with SCCHN and 136 age- and sex-matched controls. Using the control median as the cut-off, the elevated risk of SCCHN was 2.35 (95% CI, 1.37-4.03), 2.28 (95% CI, 1.34-3.98) and 3.25 (95% CI, 1.85-5.07) for high levels of tail extension, tail length and oliver tail moment of the comet assay, respectively, and 1.75 (95% CI, 1.04-2.94) for high levels of chromosomal aberrations of the mutagen sensitivity assay. The effects of these 2 types of measurements were additive; subjects with high levels of both DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations had a 4.77-fold increased risk (95% CI, 2.73-8.36) of SCCHN. Cigarette smoking further elevated this risk to more than 20-fold (OR 23.6; 95% CI, 8.92-62.3). These data support our previous finding that suboptimal repair contributed to susceptibility to SCCHN and the new data further suggests a possible gene-environment interaction that may play an important role in the etiology of SCCHN. Further validation studies are warranted."
CD008054,0,9367065,0,Antioxidant nutrients: associations with persistent human papillomavirus infection.,"Research from the past several years has definitively shown intermediate and high risk-type human papillomavirus (HPV) infection to play a significant role in cervical carcinogenesis. Persistent compared with intermittent infection appears to confer an elevated risk, and cofactors may be necessary to allow the virus to progress to cervical cancer. We explored the association between circulating concentrations of the antioxidant nutrients (alpha- and beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene, beta-cryptoxanthin, alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, and ascorbate) and persistent HPV infection among 123 low-income Hispanic women who were all nonsmokers and were not currently using vitamin and mineral supplements. In addition, the association between these nutrients and grade of cervical pathology, independent of HPV status, was assessed. Intermediate and high risk-type HPV infection was assessed by the Digene Hybrid Capture System at two time points, 3 months apart. At the second interview, cytology, colposcopy, and a fasting blood draw were conducted. Mean concentrations of serum and plasma antioxidant nutrients were calculated within categories of HPV status (two times HPV negative, one time HPV positive, and two times HPV positive) and colposcopy. Adjusted mean concentrations of serum beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein, and alpha- and gamma-tocopherol were on average 24% (P < 0.05) lower among women two times HPV positive compared with either two times HPV negative or one time HPV positive. Independent of HPV status, alpha-tocopherol was significantly inversely associated with grade of cervical dysplasia (normal, 21.57 microM; cervical intraepithelial neoplasia III, 17.27 microM). The results obtained in this study need to be confirmed in larger cohort studies with a longer follow-up period."

CD008054,0,20840254,0,Clinical management of HPV-related disease of the lower genital tract.,"Cytology remains the mainstay for cervical screening. The need to achieve effective management, limit complications, and preserve reproductive function led to the popularity of local treatment. Although the cure rates for ablative and excisional methods are similar, the excisional method provides a more reliable histopathological diagnosis. Recent evidence revealed increased perinatal morbidity after treatment that appears to be related to the proportion of cervix removed. The human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test appears to enhance the detection of disease in primary screening, in the triage of minor cytological abnormalities, and in follow-up. Further research on the clinical application of a scoring system is ongoing. The vaccines are now available and appear to be safe, well tolerated, and highly efficacious in HPV naive women. A synergy of vaccination and screening will be required. Treatment for early cervical cancer is increasingly shifting toward more fertility-sparing surgical techniques. Careful selection of patients is essential."
CD008054,0,20840253,0,Can HPV testing replace the pap smear?,"The most compelling question in evaluating the possible replacement of the conventional Papanicolaou smear from a high-risk HPV testing method is the balance between specificity and sensitivity for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade â¥CIN 2 (CIN 2+). Multiple studies have shown that HPV testing has higher sensitivity than cytology for the detection of high-grade CIN. Positivity increases the test cut-off for HPV and may reduce false positive results without significantly compromising the sensitivity, potentially alleviating the concern of low specificity. Overall, available evidence convincingly shows that HPV testing is superior to traditional screening for the detection of high-grade cervical lesions, and efforts are focused on improving its sensitivity, either by increasing its cut-off for positivity or by selecting those subgroups where HPV testing is expected to have higher positive predictive value for cervical disease, or by seeking to optimize triage tests after a positive HPV result."

Cervical cancer remains the second most frequent cause of death in women across the world. Epidemiologic and molecular studies have shown that human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with cervical carcinogenesis.

We found no statistically significant differences between HPV-seropositive and HPV-seronegative women in the risk of a new infection with the homologous HPV type, with the exception of a reduced risk of HPV 45 infections 4.5 years beyond the baseline serology measurement in HIV-positive women [hazard ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.05-0.89]. Among HIV-negative women, HPV seropositivity was not associated with a statistically significant reduced risk of infections with related viruses in the HPV 16, HPV 18, or ""other"" HPV groups. Among HIV-positive women, HPV seropositivity was associated with a slightly increased risk of infection with group-related viruses, but the differences were only statistically significant for infection with HPV 16 group viruses (hazard ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) in HPV 18-seropositive women and for infections with ""other"" HPV group viruses in HPV 31-seropositive women (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.0-2.0). The lack of a protective immune effect from natural infection is most likely due to the low level of antibody elicited by natural HPV infection and/or the potential for reactivation of HPV, especially in HIV-positive women."

CD008054,0,16161049,0,Immunocytochemistry in liquid-based cervical cytology: analysis of clinical use following a cross-sectional study.,"Cytological screening for cervical cancer is hampered by imperfect sensitivity and low inter-observer reproducibility. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing lacks specificity as a primary screening method. Studies indicate that immunocytochemical detection of alterations caused by HPV in the host cells can optimise screening. Here, the potential of p16(INK4a) (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16) and MIB-1 (Ki-67 proliferation marker) as adjunct molecular markers for cervical lesions was investigated in a prospective, cross-sectional study of 500 samples in the framework of opportunistic screening in Flanders, Belgium. A consecutive series of 200 samples and 100 samples from the cytological categories ASC, LSIL and HSIL were investigated. Surepath samples were interpreted according to the Bethesda 2001 reporting system. HPV testing was done with MY09/MY11 consensus PCR. Immunocytochemistry for p16(INK4a) and MIB-1 was performed with an automated staining protocol. The number of immunoreactive cells/1,000 cervical cells was assessed. There was a higher mean number of p16(INK4A) and MIB-1 immunoreactive cells/1,000 cells in HSIL (4.06 +/- 1.93 and 11.13 +/- 2.83, respectively) compared to other cytological categories. Both markers showed a large spread in counts, for all categories. In cases of HSIL without immunoreactive cells for either marker, low cellularity and long-term storage in water were often the cause of false negativity. This study confirms that positive staining for p16(INK4a) and MIB-1 is highly correlated with presence of high-grade lesions. These markers could be used as adjuncts to increase the sensitivity of cytological screening as well as the specificity of the HPV test. However, clear methodological standards are needed for optimal performance of immunocytochemistry in a clinical setting."

The New Zealand Contraception and Health Study Group.","Three cohorts of women aged 20-39 attending medical practitioners or family planning clinics in New Zealand for contraceptive advice were followed prospectively for five years. The three cohorts were defined by use (or at least prescription) of one of three study contraceptive methods at the time of beginning of follow-up--oral contraceptives (OC), intrauterine devices (IUD) or depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)--and numbered 2469, 2072 and 1721 women, respectively. Follow-up was intended to be annual and included cervical smear as well as interim contraceptive and medical histories. A positive outcome (referred to here as 'dysplasia') was any degree of definite dysplasia or carcinoma of the cervix diagnosed cytologically by a central study laboratory, and confirmed by histology or analysis of DNA ploidy. In the three cohorts (OC, IUD and MPA, respectively), 12,839, 10,774 and 8,984 person-years of follow-up were accumulated and 125, 92 and 101 cases of dysplasia were confirmed. Crude annual rates of dysplasia per 1,000 person-years were approximately the same in the OC (9.6) and IUD (8.4) cohorts. Crude rates were higher in the MPA cohort (11.3 per 1,000 person-years). However, important confounding factors, principally smoking and sexual behavior, were identified with rate ratios ranging between 1 and 3 over the range of the potentially confounding variables, and multivariate analyses revealed no evidence of increased risk for the MPA cohort when these factors were taken into account. At least over the short term, there appears to be no difference in risk of cervical dysplasia between women using these three methods of contraception if differences between groups in respect to known confounding factors are taken into account."
CD008054,0,8621187,0,Image cytometric analysis in pathology.,"Image cytometry (ICM) is used in surgical pathology to quantify nuclear DNA content, nuclear and cytoplasmic immunostain. DNA aneuploidy is shown to be an independent negative prognostic factor in malignant melanoma, small cell carcinoma of the lung, esophageal, ovarian, endometrial, prostatic, urinary bladder, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. On bladder washings, DNA ploidy by ICM is used as an aid in diagnosis and management of recurrent transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Quantitation of nuclear immunostain for proliferation markers by ICM has clinical significance in prognosis and management of solid tumors of bladder, breast and ovary, astrocytoma, lymphoma, and malignant melanoma. Angiogenesis, measured by microvessel density is a predictor of prognosis in breast carcinoma and an independent predictor of metastasis for breast carcinoma, malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and prostate carcinoma. Quantitated by ICM, angiogenesis is predictive of the presence or subsequent development of regional lymph node metastases in head and neck squamous carcinomas. Future prospects for ICM in pathology include the standardization of ICM techniques; extended clinical use of DNA ploidy for diagnosis, prognosis and as a help with therapeutic decisions; development of neural networks and quantification of fluorescence in situ hybridization to distinguish benign from malignant lesions of low malignant potential, and three-dimensional reconstruction of morphology from two-dimensional sections measured for prognostic parameters."

Thirty-eight formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hysterectomy specimens of cervical carcinoma and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III were examined for the presence of HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35 DNA by in situ hybridization (ISH) with biotinylated DNA probes. The HPV 6 and 11 were not detected, but HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35 were detected in 63% (24 of 38) of CIN III and cervical carcinoma. The HPV-negative specimens by ISH were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of HPV 16 and 52b with high sensitivity. In 11 of 14 specimens, specific amplification of HPV 16 was detected and HPV DNA was demonstrated in 92% (35 of 38). A retrospective examination for the presence of HPV DNA by ISH and PCR was performed on sequential biopsy specimens of eight cases whose hysterectomy specimens were judged as HPV 16/18 positive. In the eight cases, HPV 16 was constantly demonstrated in all biopsy specimens throughout the course, from early dysplastic change to carcinoma. This finding indicates long (up to 10 years) persistence of HPV infection in the natural course of progression to carcinoma of the uterine cervix."
CD008054,0,11876392,0,Strategies for the modification of risk factors in gynecological cancers.,"Strategies to modify risk for female or gynecological cancers will vary with our knowledge of the epidemiology, etiology, and specific molecular mechanisms for each individual cancer. In general, cancer preventive strategies have been divided into primary and secondary prevention with primary prevention directed toward the causative factors for a disease. Secondary prevention is classically used in cervical cancer cytology screening programs and is essentially an attempt to identify individuals in a population with preclinical phases of the disease where intervention will impact mortality the most. A vast literature has evolved regarding the epidemiology of most of the common cancers in women. While the specific molecular mechanisms are not completely understood at this time knowledge of contributing factors for many of these tumors is well known. The association of cigarette smoking with lung cancer has been well established and the increasing rates of lung cancer, particularly in women, are directly linked to the increasing number of female smokers in the population. Indeed in many western countries lung cancer deaths have overtaken breast cancer as the most common cause of death from malignant disease in women. Excessive sun exposure without adequate skin protection is another lifestyle activity that is related to the high incidence of skin cancer in certain areas. Epidemiologically, cervical cancer has been studied extensively with the current data indicating a causal role of exposure to human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly at an early age in this disease. Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes are well understood and as more information on human genomics becomes available a clear understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of these diseases will be possible and hopefully will result in effective strategies for their control. Unfortunately, in spite of the vast knowledge that is available regarding risk factors for many of these malignancies we have been unable to influence effective lifestyle changes that could substantially reduce the risk of these malignancies in our population. Increased efforts in education, research, and commitment--both financial and educational--are required by governments and other social organizations."

A total of 342 patients screened with cytomorphologically abnormal cervical smears were monitored every 3-4 months by cervical cytology, colposcopy and HPV testing using PCR. Women with progressive CIN disease were defined as patients developing lesions with a colposcopic impression of CIN III over more than 2 quadrants or resulting in a cytological smear equivalent to Pap 5. These patients were subsequently treated according to standard procedures. If any doubt arose about the true status of the patients (n = 75) these patients were censored and biopsied. The mean follow-up time was 16.5 months (range 3-36 months). Nineteen women showed progressive CIN disease and all appeared to be continuously HPV-positive from the start of the study. At biopsy, all these patients were histologically classified as CIN III. Seventeen of these women were positive for high-risk HPV types. Two cases were classified as still unidentified HPV. No progression was seen in the absence of HPV DNA or in the presence of low-risk HPV types. In life-table analysis the cumulative rate of progressive, histologically verified CIN disease was 17% after 36 months. Further analyses showed that other risk factors such as age, sexarche, number of sexual partners or smoking hardly influenced the effect of HPV on progression. The results show that the continuous presence of high-risk HPV types in women with cytomorphologically abnormal smears is a strong marker for progressive CIN disease."

A safe and effective vaccine against HPV has long been viewed as an enormous asset to cervical cancer prevention efforts worldwide. This is particularly true for places lacking robust Pap screening programs where cervical cancer has the greatest prevalence and mortality. Well before its licensure, however, some observers noted significant obstacles that would need to be addressed in order for an HPV vaccination program to succeed. These included the vaccine's relatively high cost, availability, and opposition from socially conservative groups. Such concerns associated with the implementation of HPV vaccination were soon overwhelmed by the furor that followed the unexpectedly early efforts by the US state governments to require the vaccine as a condition of attendance in public schools, proposals imprecisely referred to as ""mandates.""

To prevent some of the anxiety and psychological distress often experienced on HPV diagnosis and during the period of management, mass patient education must accompany the incorporation of HPV DNA testing into screening protocols. To contribute to a growing body of work that provides an empiric basis for development of effective counseling messages about HPV and HPV testing, this paper highlights women's most common information gaps and psychosocial concerns and describes the different perspectives offered by women's usual sources of information about HPV, including the crucial role of the clinical community in creating a shared decision making environment in which screening decisions and results can be discussed."

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been detected in and is causally linked to various head and neck tumors, particularly nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The possible role of EBV in squamous carcinoma of the anterior nasal cavity, particularly of the nasal vestibule, has not been previously investigated. Histologic sections from 17 patients with nasal vestibular squamous carcinoma were examined. Material for EBV detection by immunohistochemistry and by in situ hybridization was available in 15 of the 17 cases. The study group consisted of eight men and nine women ranging in age from 40 to 82 years (mean age, 64 years). None of the patients was of Asian descent. The squamous carcinomas were graded as well differentiated (one case), moderately differentiated (11 cases), and poorly differentiated (five cases).

CD008054,0,20596973,0,Papillomas of the external ear canal: report of ten cases in Chinese patients with HPV in situ hybridization.,"Squamous papilloma is a benign exophytic proliferation which can occur occasionally in the external ear canal. It is widely assumed that the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is an etiologic factor of papillomas. Available techniques for detection of HPV genomes include immunohistochemistry, Southern blot hybridization, in situ hybridization (ISH), and polymerase chain reaction. To our knowledge, HPV typing has not been reported on tissue sections of papillomas in the external ear canal. We report HPV ISH analysis in ten cases of papillomas, involving the external ear canal in Chinese patients. These papilloma excrescences were less than 1 cm in diameter, and were benign morphologically. Automated HPV ISH analysis was performed for the hybridization of DNA probes, including both low-risk and high-risk HPV subtypes. HPV ISH results revealed that seven out of ten cases were positive for low-risk HPV (6, 11), three cases demonstrated no hybridization for low-risk HPV probe, and none of the cases revealed any detection of high-risk HPV (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 66). On follow-up after 18-29 months (average 24.5 months), eight patients were doing well, with no local recurrence after excision. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Our results confirm that benign papillomas of the external ear canal are associated with low-risk HPV infection with benign behavior and neither recurrence nor high grade dysplasia."

Some reports have suggested a high incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCCA) in OLP patients and have implicated OLP as a premalignant lesion. We describe five cases of OSCCA arising in patients with preexisting OLP. At our institution, the incidence of OSCCA in patients with OLP approximates that reported in other series. The immunopathologic basis for OLP, its potential association with malignancy, and the variable clinical picture of OSCCA in patients with OLP are reviewed. Specific recommendations are given for treatment and follow-up of lesions, including the role of future testing with viral and oncogene markers."

The aim of this study was to sub-classify SCC of the oropharynx based upon histologic features into nonkeratinizing (NK) SCC, keratinizing (K) SCC, and hybrid SCC, and determine the frequency of HPV and patient survival in each group. Patients with oropharyngeal SCC with a minimum of 2 years of clinical follow-up were identified from radiation oncology databases from 1997 to 2004. All patients received either up front surgery with postoperative radiation or definitive radiation based therapy. In situ hybridization (ISH) for high-risk HPV subtypes and immunohistochemistry for p16, a protein frequently up-regulated in HPV-associated carcinomas, were performed. Overall and disease-specific survival were assessed. Of 118 cases, 46.6% were NK SCC, 24.6% K SCC and 28.8% hybrid SCC. NK SCC occurred in slightly younger patients that were more often male. It more frequently presented with lymph node metastases and was surgically resected compared to K SCC. NK SCC was significantly more likely to be HPV and p16 positive than KSCC (P < 0.001) and to have better overall and disease-specific survival (P = 0.0002; P = 0.0142, respectively). Hybrid SCC was also more likely than K SCC to be HPV and p16 positive (P = 0.003; P = 0.002, respectively) and to have better overall survival (P = 0.0105). Sub-classification of oropharyngeal SCC by histologic type provides useful clinical information. NK SCC histology strongly predicts HPV-association and better patient survival compared to K SCC. Hybrid SCC appears to have an intermediate frequency of HPV-association and patient survival."

Despite being a benign disease, treatment is very difficult and is characterized by frequent recurrence, spread throughout the respiratory tract, and malignant degeneration. Besides surgical resection and the established CO(2) laser treatment, laser surgery by fiber-guided Nd:YAG laser light promises to be a bloodless and effective treatment procedure. To improve this new method, a novel fiber guidance instrument has been developed to aid in endolaryngal laser surgery of RRP. Study design and setting The method described uses a specially designed instrument for fiber guidance that is equipped with a bendable distal tip to move the fiber end precisely. Moreover, the instrument includes an additional channel for the suction of smoke and pyrolysis products.

CD008054,0,9105860,0,The HPV determinants of CIN I.,"Correlates of HPV amongst a cohort of women with a CIN I detected by a screening Pap test were investigated. Co-incident CIN II/III lesions were identified and their influence on the HPV status and HPV determinants of screening detected CIN I was assessed. Based on both the colposcopic impression and repeat Pap test, 537 women referred for examination of a Pap test classified as CIN I were triaged into two groups. Group A lesions were assessed as </= CIN I; n = 342 (63.7%) and group B as >/= CIN II; n = 195 (36.3%). Clinical, demographic, reproductive, and risk factor for cervical cancer correlates were collected. HPV typing of cervical scrapes collected at the colposcopic examination was done by PCR amplification using seven sets of type specific and one set of consensus primers. HPV positivity was identified in 47% of all scrapes; types 16/18 (28%), 31/33/35 (10%), 6/11 (2%), and unknown (7%). The HPV status of the cohort and group A were very similar. Group B had a slightly higher rate of HPV positivity (52%) due to an increase in types 16/18. Statistically significant correlates of HPV prevalence or type were not identified either for the entire group or both triage groups, however in each group, HPV positive women tended to be younger and to have more sexual partners. Co-incident CIN II/III spuriously increased the HPV prevalence rate of CIN I detected by a screening Pap test. The HPV appears to be sexually transmitted both in low and high grade lesions and explains why the HPV determinants of the entire cohort were unaffected by the co-incident CIN II/III."

In the phase I trial, cisplatin was studied at a fixed dose of 33 mg/m2, while decitabine was escalated in four (I-IV) dose escalation levels (45, 67, 90 to 120 mg/m2, respectively) in consecutive groups of at least 3 patients per dose level. Decytabine was administered to the patients as a two-hour intravenous infusion, while cisplatin was given intravenously immediately after the end of decitabine infusion. Both agents were given on days 1-3 every 21 days. Twenty-one patients were included in the phase I trial. Dose level IV (120 mg/m2 decitabine) was considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), while the dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and mucositis. The recommended doses for phase II trials in good- and poor-risk patients were 90 (level III) and 67 mg/m2 (level II), respectively. One short-lasting partial response was observed in a patient with cervical cancer, while two minor regression were documented in a patients with NSCLC and cervical cancer, respectively. Dose level II was selected for the phase II trial in patients with inoperable NSCLC. Fourteen consecutive patients were included in this part of the study. The median age of the patients was 57 years (range, 39-75), male/female ratio of 11/3 and a median WHO performance status 1 (0-2). The stage of disease were IIIB (5) and IV (9). Prior irradiation to the chest was given in one case. A total of 30 treatment courses were evaluable for toxicity and response, with a median of 2 courses per patient (1-4). Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in about half of the cases. Mucositis, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and skin rash were also observed in some patients. Three minor responses were documented, which lasted for 4, 16 and 36 weeks. Median survival of patients was 15 weeks (4-38). In conclusion, the cisplatin plus decitabine combination did not exhibit significant antitumor activity in patients with NSCLC at the dose and schedule applied in this trial to justify its further evaluation in this patient population."

Persistent infection could be further refined by a sequencing approach to detect early cervical lesions that are at high risk of developing an invasive squamous cervical cancer. The aim of the present study is to investigate the clinical utility of detecting mRNA transcripts of HPV oncogenes E6/E7 by using a Real-time NASBA technology (mRNA test) and to identify women with low-grade cytological disease but with an increased risk of developing high-grade cervical abnormalities or invasive squamous cervical cancer. Our preliminary results show that E6/E7 is detected in only a subset of HR-HPV-positive cases. Since viral persistence is considered to be the true precursor of neoplastic progression, only the detection of E6/E7 mRNA can identify the infection which is more likely to persist and induce neoplasia in future. For these reasons we believe that this test would be useful for the characterization of women with HR-HPV DNA positivity who should be effectively treated because at high-risk of developing a high grade cervical lesion or an invasive squamous cervical cancer."

Moreover, until the present investigation most studies only investigated the cases with abnormal smear findings and did not include long-term follow-up, nor detailed follow-up of women with a normal smear but positive HPV typing, although this patient subgroup is of particular interest. The patient population included 3778 women who underwent routine cytological cervical screening and who gave their informed consent to participate in this study, consisting of a cervical smear, HPV testing via a second-generation Hybrid Capture II assay (which is more sensitive than first-generation tests, and can detect 18 different HPV types, i.e., 13 oncogenic and five non-oncogenic types); and in the case of abnormal smear findings, colposcopic examination and directed biopsies of the sites of suspected lesions.

We have analyzed specimens of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) from 110 patients for p53 gene mutations and 92 of them additionally for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in order to evaluate the prognostic significance of these factors by comparison with clinical follow-up data. Using the method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE), mutations within the exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were found in 48 tumors (44%). Sequencing revealed missense mutations in most cases (15/20). Frequency of p53 gene mutations was not related to the tumor stage, the grade of differentiation, the presence of lymph node metastases, or the smoking history of the patients. With the help of a highly sensitive PCR/hybridization assay, an infection with the high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 could be detected in 39/92 tumor specimens (42%). Follow-up data were obtained from 99 patients with a range of 2-112 months. No correlation of overall survival on the presence of p53 gene mutations or HPV infection could be observed.

CD008054,0,17273725,0,Current advances in the basic research and clinical management of sinonasal inverted papilloma (review).,"Inverted papilloma (IP) is a benign sinonasal lesion that has a known propensity for recurrence, local aggressiveness and an association with transformation to squamous cell carcinoma. Due to the high rate of recurrence, association with malignancy and a tendency of multicentricity, the surgical approaches to treatment are controversial. Over the years there has been a slow evolution from aggressive (en bloc) resection by lateral rhinotomy to endoscopic techniques. This progress corresponds to the advances that have been made in endoscopic sinus surgery over the past 15 years. Technological advances have allowed the detection of sinonasal IP before its extension beyond the sinonasal region, thus enabling minimally invasive techniques to be used in the treatment of selected cases of IP. Differences in recurrence rates were not observed for endoscopic management as compared with lateral rhinotomy or sublabial degloving approaches. In terms of aetiology there is certain evidence that the presence of HPV in IP could be predictive of malignant transformation. Although IPs are monoclonal proliferations, they do not fit the profile of a prototypic precursor lesion. In contrast, an increased EGFR and TGF-alpha expression is associated with early events in IP carcinogenesis. Parameters such as hyperkeratosis, squamous epithelial hyperplasia and a high mitotic index are negative prognostic indicators, which could be useful in the future follow-up of patients with IP. Present literature should encourage us to recommend the use of a uniformly accepted staging system. The propensity for delayed recurrences and the maximal 13% incidence of malignant transformation mandates careful, long-term follow-up."

Recently, the commercially manufactured PCR-based Roche AMPLICOR (AMP) and LINEAR ARRAY (LA) HPV tests have become available for HPV detection. However, knowledge of their clinical performance compared to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) assay is limited. This study evaluated the concordance between the HC2, AMP, and LA tests in detecting HR-HPV among a cohort of 1,679 women with previous abnormal Pap smear results. Overall, 1,393 specimens (81.3%) generated concordant results for HR-HPV presence or absence by the three assays. The concordance levels were substantial between the HC2 and AMP tests (84.4%, kappa = 0.6419) and between the HC2 and LA tests (84.0%, kappa = 0.6341) and nearly perfect between the AMP and LA tests (97.8%, kappa = 0.9441). HR-HPV prevalence, as detected by the AMP or LA tests, was significantly higher among women with cytological or histological high-grade disease (CIN2 or greater) than that detected by HC2 (P < 0.0001). The AMP and LA tests exhibited greater sensitivity, but lower specificity, than HC2 for detecting HR-HPV among this cohort of women with underlying cervical abnormalities, particularly among subjects with histologically proven high-grade disease. Both PCR-based HPV tests may be valuable in the management of care for women with underlying cervical abnormalities, in predicting treatment success, and in studying the clearance or acquisition of new infections."

CD008054,0,16570279,0,"Determination of viral load thresholds in cervical scrapings to rule out CIN 3 in HPV 16, 18, 31 and 33-positive women with normal cytology.","An increased high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) viral load in cervical scrapings has been proposed as a determinant for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer (> or =CIN 2), but data so far for HPV types different from HPV 16 are limited and inconsistent. In addition, a viral load threshold to distinguish hrHPV positive women without > or =CIN 2 still has not been defined. Here, we used baseline cervical scrapings of women with normal cytology participating in a large population-based cervical screening trial (i.e. POBASCAM) who were GP5+/6+-PCR positive for 4 common hrHPV types, i.e. HPV 16, 18, 31 or 33, as a reference to arbitrarily define various viral load thresholds (i.e. 25th, 33rd, 50th, 67th and 75th percentiles of the lowest viral load values) for distinguishing women having single infections with these types without high-grade CIN. Viral load assessment was performed by real time type-specific PCR. The viral load threshold values were subsequently validated on abnormal cervical scrapes of 162 women with underlying, histologically confirmed CIN lesions containing 1 of these 4 hrHPV types. All 59 women with CIN 3 had viral load levels that were higher than those of 33% of the women with normal cytology containing the respective hrHPV type detectable by GP5+/6+-PCR (i.e. higher than the 33rd percentile of viral load). By using this 33rd percentile viral load cut-off, sensitivity for CIN 3 of 100% (95% CI 93.9-100) was obtained. Hence, application of this viral load threshold would increase the specificity of HPV testing for HPV 16, 18, 31 and 33-associated prevalent CIN 3 without the cost of a marked reduction in sensitivity. In practice, on the basis of viral load analysis, a less aggressive management can be foreseen for 33% of the women with normal cytology participating in a population-based screening program who are GP5+/6+-PCR positive for HPV 16, 18, 31 or 33."
CD008054,0,1551371,0,A model for quantitative follow-up studies of cervical lesions.,"A model for follow-up studies of cervical lesions is described in which the specimen were taken in a noninvasive way using Cytobrushes and in which automatic measurement of the abnormal nuclei in the sampled epithelial fragments was possible because 2-microns thin Feulgen-stained plastic sections were prepared. The planimetric parameters AREA, PERIMETER, FORM PE, and FORM ELL, and the densitometric parameters optical density (OD) and integrated optical density (IOD) were assessed. The mean total volume and the mean total DNA were calculated using stereological methods. The moderate dysplasias differed from the carcinoma in situs for all the densitometric parameters except for OD, and from the invasive carcinomas for IOD and 5cER. In the moderate-dysplasia group, there were three types of DNA histograms: a highly abnormal type resembling the histograms of the carcinoma group, a normal type, and an intermediate type. Changes in DNA histograms can be established during follow-up studies of dysplasias without having disturbed the lesion due to the efficient and elegant noninvasive sampling method that was not used in earlier quantitative studies."

IV: role of smoking habits.,"The role of smoking and other risk factors for cervical neoplasia was investigated in a population-based case-control study of 586 women with histologically verified cervical squamous-cell carcinoma in situ (CIS), and 59 women with invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer from Copenhagen. Controls were randomly selected from the general female population using the computerized Danish Central Population Register. After adjustment for a variety of confounding variables, which were all significantly associated with CIS risk and included age, number of partners, proportion of sexually active life without barrier contraceptive use, years with intra-uterine devices, number of births, and age at first episode of genital warts (as a proxy measure for human papillomavirus exposure), current cigarette smoking was found to be significantly associated with CIS [adjusted relative risk (RR) = 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7-3.4]. Ex-smokers had a lower, but still significantly increased risk (RR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.0-2.7). A dose-response relationship was present, especially for number of cigarettes smoked per day. In contrast, the crude estimates showed a weak association between invasive cervical cancer and smoking, which however disappeared after confounder control. The results of the present study support the hypothesis implicating smoking as a risk factor for CIS."

CD008054,0,9466762,0,Antibodies against early proteins of human papillomaviruses as diagnostic markers for invasive cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer is the most prevalent tumor in developing countries and the second most frequent cancer among females worldwide. Specific human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and, most notably, HPV types 16 and 18 are recognized as being causally associated with this malignancy. Antibodies against early HPV proteins E6 and E7 have been found more often in patients with tumors than in controls. Existing peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of anti-E6 and anti-E7 antibodies in human sera have low levels of sensitivity and specificity and thus are not suitable for use as diagnostic tools. Based on highly purified recombinant native proteins, we developed four sandwich ELISAs for the detection of antibodies against HPV type 16 and 18 E6 and E7 proteins. We demonstrate their sensitivities and high degrees of specificity for cervical cancer. Among a total of 501 serum specimens from unselected patients with invasive cervical cancer, 52.9% reacted positively in at least one of the four assays. In contrast, among 244 serum specimens from control subjects without cervical cancer, only 2 reactive serum specimens (0.8%) were found. For 19 of 19 antibody-positive patients, the HPV type indicated by seroreactivity was identical to the HPV DNA type found in the tumor, which also indicates a high degree of specificity for antibody detection with respect to HPV type. In a direct comparison of 72 serum specimens from patients with cervical cancer, 56% of the specimens reacted in at least one of the four protein ELISAs, whereas 40% reacted in at least one of seven peptide ELISAs covering the four antigens. These assays could be of value for the detection of invasive cervical cancer in settings in which cytology-based early tumor screening is not available, for the clinical management of patients diagnosed with cervical cancer, and for the immunological monitoring of E6 and E7 vaccination trials."
CD008054,0,20886598,0,Economic evaluation of strategies for managing women with equivocal cytological results in Brazil.,"In Brazil, current management of women with screening results of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) is to offer repeat testing at 6-month intervals. Alternative management strategies that have been adopted in many high-income settings are to offer immediate colposcopy referral or to utilise human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing as a triage for colposcopy referral, and to consider different strategies according to women's age. The objective of our study was to evaluate the lifetime cost effectiveness in terms of cost per years of life saved (YLS) of these alternative strategies for a middle income setting. A Markov model was developed using data from the Ludwig-McGill cohort and calibrated to independent observational datasets and local cost estimates obtained. In the base-case analysis, repeat cytology was the least costly strategy but also the least effective. Based on the WHO threshold for very cost-effective interventions, HPV triage for women above 30 years-old was the strategy with the highest probability of being cost effective. HPV triage including younger women with ASCUS results would also be a cost-effective option. Whilst there was a slight further gain in effectiveness with immediate colposcopy referral, it was also more expensive and did not appear to be cost effective. Threshold analysis indicated that an HPV test would have to be more than twice as expensive as a cytology test for HPV triage to no longer be cost effective. In conclusion, our results indicate that in middle income settings HPV triage is likely to be the optimal strategy for managing women presenting with ASC-US results."

Studies of allelic imbalance (AI) were performed by Southern blot analysis and by using two PCR (polymerase chain reaction) polymorphisms within the TP53 gene. AI in the tumour was observed in 22 per cent (11 of 52 informative patients) and was significantly associated with recurrence both in a univariate (P = 0.013) and in a multivariate (P = 0.045) analysis. The DNA samples were subjected to mutation analysis of four of the conserved domains in the TP53 gene, using PCR followed by constant denaturant gel electrophoresis (CDGE). Mutations were observed in 2 of 92 tumours (2 per cent), of which one was a silent mutation and the other a frameshift. Overexpression of the p53 protein was found by immunostaining of sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material in 55 per cent (51/92) of the tumours. In 88 per cent (45/51) of these, overexpression was present in less than 5 per cent of the tumour cells. Overexpression was significantly associated with relapse-free survival only in a univariate analysis (P = 0.045). AI of the TP53 locus did not correlate with p53 expression or mutation. The important gene on 17p, responsible for the shorter disease-free survival for patients with AI of TP53, may therefore be another gene closely linked to TP53. In addition, the 92 tumour samples were tested for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. Fifty-four per cent (50/92) of the samples were positive for HPV 16 using in situ hybridization, and 93 per cent (86/92) using the PCR technique. The numbers for HPV 18 were 15 per cent (14/92) and 23 per cent (21/92), respectively. Twenty-one per cent (19/92) were positive for both HPV 16 and HPV 18, while 4 per cent (4/92) were negative for both HPV 16 and 18. The tumour with the frameshift TP53 mutation was HPV 16-positive, and the four samples negative for HPV 16 and 18 did not contain TP53 mutations within the conserved domains but had elevated p53 protein expression."

CD008054,0,18382353,1,"Correlation of Pap smear, cervical biopsy, and clinical follow-up with an HPV typing microarray system.","A human papillomavirus (HPV) microarray system allows the determination of HPV type in clinical samples. The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of HPV in liquid-based Pap smears with the MyGene MyHPV Chip Kit HPV genotyping microarray test (MyGene Assay), and to correlate this with the cytology and biopsy diagnoses, clinical follow-up, HPV Hybrid Capture data, and HPV sequence analyses. Four hundred and two Pap smears (93 ThinPrep, 309 SurePath) were available for study. Correlation of HPV DNA detection by the MyGene Assay with the Pap smear diagnosis showed a detection rate of 19/97 (19%) for normal Pap smears, 181/242 (74%) for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), and 61/63 (97%) for squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs). Biopsy data on 248 women were available. HPV was noted by the MyGene Assay in the Pap smear in 98/100 (98%) of the cases, for which the corresponding biopsy had been diagnosed as SIL, compared with 103/148 (69%) of the cases for which the biopsy had been negative for SIL. Clinical follow-ups were available for 200 women with ASCUS Pap smears. A significant increase was observed in the rate of biopsy-proven SILs in women with ASCUS Pap smears that were HPV-positive (63/66=95%) as compared with those that were HPV-negative (96/134=71%, P<0.05). The MyGene Assay and Hybrid Capture system gave equivalent results for all the categories studied, except for the presence of multiple infections, as determined by viral sequence analysis. Specifically, the Hybrid Capture system overestimated the presence of dual infection (low-risk and high-risk positive) by 48% and missed many cases of multiple infections, especially when 2 or more high-risk types were present. It is concluded that the MyGene Assay allows for the routine typing of HPV in liquid-based Pap smears, and that the presence of HPV DNA in ASCUS Pap smears is strongly correlated with a biopsy-proven SIL."

CD008054,0,16557590,0,Cancer risk among patients with condylomata acuminata.,"Condylomata acuminata have been shown to increase the risk of anogenital cancers. However, previous studies have been of limited sample size and/or short follow-up duration, which prevent precise estimates of long-term excess risk, especially for specific cancer sites. We estimated the risk of specific cancers in a large cohort of hospitalized patients with condylomata acuminata, as recorded in the Swedish Inpatient Register between 1965 and 1999. Altogether, 10,971 patients (1,685 men and 9,286 women) were followed through 1999 for a median of 13 years. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR)--the ratio of the observed number of cancers to the number expected on the basis of the incidence in the Swedish population at large--was used as a measure of relative risk. After excluding the first-year of follow-up, we observed 43 cases of anogenital cancer in women, and 7 cases in men. Risks were elevated for cancers of the vulva (N = 13, SIR = 10.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.4-17.4), vagina (N = 4, SIR = 12.0, 95% CI = 3.3-30.7) and penis (N = 5, SIR = 21.9, 95% CI = 7.1-51.2). There was a moderate excess risk of cervical cancer in situ (N = 259, SIR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.7-2.1), but not invasive cervical cancer. Excess risks of esophageal, buccal cavity, nonmelanoma skin, lung and bladder cancers, and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, were also observed in both men and women. In conclusion, condylomata acuminata are strongly associated with increased risk of cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis and anus, as well as some nonanogenital malignancies, but not invasive cervical cancer."

CD008054,0,10962445,0,Human papillomavirus type 16 E6/E7-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in women with cervical neoplasia.,"Infection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types is associated with the development of cervical neoplasia (CIN). The E6 and E7 oncoproteins are constitutively expressed in these lesions and are therefore putative targets for the immune response against HPV. The relation between HPV 16-specific memory cytotoxic T-cell precursor (mCTLp) activity to both oncoproteins and the natural course of cervical dysplasia was analyzed in 38 patients participating in a nonintervention cohort study of women with CIN and 11 HPV 16-positive cervical carcinoma patients. In a cross-sectional study at the end of follow-up prior to biopsy, 8 of 20 patients with a persistent HPV 16 infection had specific mCTLp against at least one of the two oncoproteins. By contrast, no specific mCTLp activity was detected in 11 HPV-negative patients or in 7 patients who had cleared an HPV 16 infection at the end of follow-up. However, 5 of 11 cervical carcinoma patients showed mCTLp activity against the E7 protein only. This study demonstrates that HPV 16 oncogene-specific mCTLp are present in women with HPV 16-positive CIN prior to any intervention. Since HPV-specific mCTLp were detected predominantly in women with high-grade lesions or invasive cervical carcinoma and not in women who cleared the virus, the role of naturally occurring mCTLp in the protection against HPV-associated cervical neoplasia remains to be established."

To elucidate the role of DNA ploidy and cellular proliferation, resected tumors of 48 patients with primary or recurrent HNSCC were analyzed by flow cytometry and in vitro-5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation (BrdU). The results were compared with histopathological findings such as tumor size, lymph node involvement and tumor differentiation. To assess the influence of intratumoral heterogeneity of these biological parameters, multiple biopsies (>3) were analyzed by flow cytometry and BrdU-incorporation in 12 larger (>4 cm diameter) tumors. BrdU-labeling index (LI%) was significantly higher in aneuploid HNSCC and correlated significantly with poor histologic differentiation of the analyzed tumor tissues (P<0.001). Furthermore, a trend for higher LI% in nodal positive tumors was observed. Aneuploid HNSCC showed significantly more often tissue dedifferentiation (P=0.049) and in most cases an advanced tumor stage, especially in tumors with biclonal cell lines. Lymph node involvement was also seen more often in aneuploid and undifferentiated tumors. As in aneuploid tumors recurrent HNSCC showed in most cases a higher LI% and poor tissue differentiation, but as a result of the small collection of samples there was no correlation between aneuploidy and tumor recurrence. To proof the robustness of the acquired data and to estimate the influence of intratumoral heterogeneity to ploidy and LI% multiple biopsies were analyzed in larger tumors. Using a specific statistical algorithm a secure estimation of ploidy and LI% was possible by a single biopsy in these tumors. These findings indicate aneuploidy and proliferative activity as important findings for malignant progression in HNSCC. An estimation of these biological parameters may be useful for identification of patients with high risk for lymph node involvement or tumor recurrence and pre-treatment can be performed by a single biopsy. As a conclusion, these patients may benefit from more aggressive treatment."
CD008054,0,10479112,0,Cervical dysplasia in women with HIV.,"Prevention of cervical cancer in HIV-positive women is possible through regular cervical cytological screening for early detection and a variety of effective treatment options for dysplasia. Women with HIV infection continue to have an increased rate of CIN, and cervical dysplasia appears to recur more frequently and progress more rapidly in severely immunocompromised women with high-risk type HPV infection. The Pap test is an effective screening tool, but high rates of recurrence in immunocompromised women reinforce the need for more frequent screening in HIV-positive women with a history of abnormal smears and CD4 counts less than 200. Health care providers should be aware of the latest recommendations for cervical dysplasia evaluation and should apply these in their care of HIV-infected women. Early detection, prompt treatment, and meticulous follow-up are essential in the prevention of cervical dysplasia, as well as the morbidity and mortality associated with cervical cancer in women with HIV."

CD008054,0,15785874,0,Gene profiling in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.,"Survival for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is still poor, despite great technical improvements in radiotherapy and surgery. A possible explanation for this is the lack of individualization in treatment based on biological properties of the tumors, resulting in over- as well as under treatment. Management of SCCHN has mainly been based on TNM classification over the last decades. However, a large amount of studies have shown that biomarkers may add prognostic information, independently of the TNM system, indicating that biological aggressiveness is not entirely reflected by the T- and N-status of the tumor. A conclusion to draw from this is that the present standardized treatment based on macroscopic features of the tumor in many cases will result in suboptimal treatment since important underlaying genetic properties of the tumors are not taken into consideration. A variety of laboratory techniques have been used in studies that investigate the individual biological features, spanning from methods that screen the genome for chromosomal and genetic abnormalities, e.g. cytogenetics, CGH, SKY, cDNA micro array to detailed studies of specific aberrations, e.g. southern, northern and western blotting, PCR based analysis and immunohistochemistry. Dysregulation of genes involved in e.g. cell cycle control, proliferation, drug resistance, and metastasis have been linked to outcome of treatment and survival. The purpose of this review of the literature was to summarize what has been studied so far by cDNA micro array techniques with regards to genetic screening in general and biomarkers that relate to response to therapy and prediction of clinical outcome in particular. We conclude that the majority of investigations that focus on gene profiling have a descriptive character, e.g. comparisons of tumor and normal cells, metastatic and non-metastatic properties, and differences between sub-sites and grades of differentiation. There are just a handful studies that so far have investigated how gene profiling can be used to predict clinical course."
CD008054,0,15386375,0,Type-specific associations of human papillomavirus load with risk of developing cervical carcinoma in situ.,"We have previously shown that high human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 load in Papanicolaou smears negative for dysplasia is strongly associated with risk for carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the cervix. Here we study the amount of HPV DNA for some of the most frequent high-risk HPV types as determinants of progression to cervical CIS. Real-time PCR is used to estimate the normalized viral load of HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 52, 58 and 67 in 457 cases of cervical CIS and 552 matched population controls. A total of 2,747 archival Pap smears from gynecologic health examinations, collected over a period of up to 26 years, were analyzed to assess viral load during the infection history. Cervical smear samples differ widely in amount of DNA, underscoring the need for normalization of HPV load to number of cells in the sample. The risk of developing cervical CIS increases with higher viral load for most of the HPV types studied. The range of copy numbers per cell does not differ between HPV types but the odds ratio for CIS in the percentile with highest viral load is substantially higher for HPV 16 (OR = 36.9; 95% CI = 8.9-153.2) than for HPV 31 (OR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.1-9.1) or HPV 18/45 (OR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.0-6.4). Therefore, HPV viral load may be predictive of future risk of cervical CIS at a stage when smears are negative for squamous abnormalities, but differences between HPV types need closer attention."

Particularly in children and adolescents, somatic or germ cell mutations may lead to hyperthyroidism. In these cases, molecular analysis of the TSHR gene provides important information for further clinical management. We report a 3-year-old boy with a rare somatic TSHR mutation causing autonomous adenoma of the thyroid gland in order to illustrate how the genetic analysis of the lesion impacted on the surgical strategy. The patient presented with a left neck mass, negative thyroid autoantibodies, and unifocal autonomy on thyroid scan. He underwent local resection of the adenoma. Genetic workup demonstrated a somatic mutation of TSHR. Exons 9 and 10 of the TSHR gene (chromosome 14q3) from peripheral blood DNA and toxic thyroid adenoma tissue DNA were amplified by PCR and analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE from the EDTA blood sample showed no difference compared to the wild-type, whereas material extracted from the tissue sample showed a mutation in exon 10. Direct sequencing of the PCR product from the tissue demonstrated a heterozygous mutation in codon 453 (ATG-->ACG), leading to a substitution of methionine by threonine. The genetic appraisal of resected thyroid tissue in cases with nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism is important to formulate surgical and medical treatment plans. In cases with somatic mutations of the TSHR, simple resection of the adenoma is sufficient, whereas total thyroidectomy should be considered in patients with germ cell mutations."

In this study, we describe the practice experience of a hospital-based reference laboratory with this new diagnostic category. The anatomic pathology computer database was searched, and 414 Papanicolaou (Pap) smears signed out as ASC-H were discovered among 60,390 Pap smear accessions over a 17-month period of time. One hundred four cases had corresponding tissue specimens. Slides from all Pap smears and tissue specimens were reviewed, and five Pap smears were reclassified, leaving 99 study cases. In our laboratory, 88.9% of the study cases had either low or high grade dysplasia diagnosed on subsequent tissue specimens. The positive predictive value of ASC-H for histologically proven high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL's) was 40.4%. Of those having human papillomavirus (HPV) hybrid capture II testing, high-risk HPV types were detected in 73.9% of cases. The majority of study cases had less than 25 atypical cells. In two hysterectomy cases and three loop electrosurgical excession procedure (LEEP) conization cases, high-grade dysplasia was present as a single microscopic focus, suggesting that the paucity of atypical cells in ASC-H Pap smears may be secondary to small lesion sampling. Thirteen study patients were postmenopausal and 30.8% had low-grade dysplasia, and of these, 46.2% had high-grade dysplasia on subsequent tissue specimens. In conclusion, our practice experience with ASC-H is similar to that reported in the literature before the 2001 Bethesda System."

Cervical smears HPV testing were proposed as an alternative to colposcopy. Neither have a sensitivity equivalent to that of colposcopy. The diagnosis of these abnormalities could be delayed, and a severe lesion may even remain undetected because the cytologic surveillance is frequently omitted, smear sensitivity is far from being perfect and correlation is poor between cytology and histology. The combination of smears with the detection of high risk HPV types increases the triage sensitivity before colposcopy to the detriment of specificity and predictive value, and, therefore, of cost. With colposcopy the histologic diagnosis is rapidly reached and therapeutic management becomes easier because the size and location of the lesion are precisely known. However, the long-term outcome of patients with a normal colposcopy is very poorly known. Our study including 212 patients with a mean follow-up of 79 months, showed an incidence of lesions similar to that found in a control group; 12 CIN (5.7%) were identified, but no cancer. The prevalence of CIN was significantly lower in patients whose initial colposcopy was normal or became normal within the first six months that in patients whose control smear was normal or became normal within six months (1/81 = 1.2% versus 8/143 = 5.6%; P > 0.05). No lesions were observed in patients whose colposcopy and control smear were normal. These results confirm the reliability of colposcopy in patients with minor cytologic abnormalities."
CD008054,0,12624548,0,Long-term administration of intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone on regression of low-grade cervical dysplasia--a pilot study.,"Although many dysplastic cervical lesions regress spontaneously, treatment is common due to concern for progression. Lesions persist or progress in women whose immune systems are unable to clear infection by human papillomavirus (HPV). Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is an adrenal steroid that has both immune modulatory and tumor inhibitory activity. A pilot study was conducted to examine the feasibility, safety and potential efficacy of intravaginal DHEA in women with low-grade cervical dysplasia. Twelve women with low-grade dysplasia, confirmed by colposcopic exam, were given 150 mg of intravaginal micronized DHEA daily for up to 6 months. Follow-up evaluations of the cervix were done at 3 and 6 months of use. DHEA, DHEA-S, androstenedione and testosterone levels were also measured. By the end of the study period, 10 of the 12 women (83%) had no evidence of dysplasia; the remaining 2 had normal colposcopic exams but cytology showing atypical cells of undetermined significance. There were no serious side effects. Androstenedione levels were elevated at 3 months, whereas testosterone levels were unchanged over the course of treatment. The results suggest that intravaginal DHEA is safe and well tolerated and may promote regression of low-grade cervical lesions. Further study is needed to establish efficacy."
CD008054,0,14639612,0,Can cervical cancer screening be stopped at 50? The prevalence of HPV in elderly women.,"Although the relation between cervical cancer and the human papillomavirus (HPV) has been established beyond doubt, the introduction of HPV detection in cervical cancer screening is halted, primarily by the high rate of false positivity in relation to morbidity, since the majority of women infected with HPV will not develop lesions. To counteract overconsumption of cervical cancer screening in elderly women, we wanted to test the hypothesis that women of 50 years or older who are HPV-negative and have a cytologically normal smear might be encouraged to refrain from further screening. As a first step, the prevalence of high-risk HPV in a population of 1,936 women of 50 years and older was investigated. After an initial decline, a slightly higher prevalence can be seen with increasing age. There is a decrease in the prevalence of multiple infections with age, paralleled by an increase in single infections, especially of HPV type 16 in the eldest-age group. However, neither the decrease in multiple infections nor the increase in single infections is statistically significant. The data obtained in this study show that, even in the presence of a slight increase in the HPV prevalence in elderly women, approximately 94% of the elderly women can be withdrawn from the cervical cancer screening. However, a follow-up study will be necessary to determine the frequency of (re)infection as well as the course of an HPV infection in elderly women."
CD008054,0,10210541,0,Chemoradiotherapy for advanced inoperable head and neck cancer: A phase II study.,"The beneficial effects of chemotherapy in patients with advanced head and neck cancer remain controversial in terms of survival, but have shown some promise in improving locoregional control and quality of life. In an effort to improve locoregional control and survival, a prospective phase II study was initiated using paclitaxel and carboplatin with concurrent conventional fractionated external-beam radiotherapy. Paclitaxel and carboplatin have both shown excellent radiosensitization through two discrete mechanisms, cell blockage in G2/M phase and inhibition of DNA repair, respectively. Patients were stratified as either operable or inoperable. This report pertains to the inoperable patient group, who received eight cycles of weekly paclitaxel (60 mg/m2), carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve of 1) with conventional radiotherapy (72 Gy). Chemoradiotherapy was followed by neck dissection for those patients who presented with clinically palpable lymph nodes. Thirty-three patients were enrolled in this group (23 men and 10 women with a median age of 56 years). Eleven patients (33%) had stage III disease; 22 (67%), stage IV disease. The median follow-up period was 14 months. Clinical complete response occurred in 20 patients (60%) and partial response occurred in 10 (30%), for an overall response rate of 90%. Following completion of therapy, 18 patients have undergone biopsy at the primary tumor site and 17 were negative. Eight of the 16 patients with clinically palpable neck nodes at presentation underwent neck dissection; five (63%) had negative nodes. Mucositis was the most common toxicity. Grade 3 or 4 mucositis occurred in 30 of the 33 (90%) patients. Other grade 3 or 4 toxicities included skin (22%), candidiasis (19%), neutropenia (9%), and dehydration (6%). One patient with laryngeal carcinoma who had pathologic complete response developed cartilage necrosis and is undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Survival data are early but encouraging. Concurrent paclitaxel, carboplatin, and external-beam radiotherapy yielded excellent clinical and pathologic responses. Mucositis remains the most common and significant morbidity. The study will continue for necessary accrual."

CD008054,0,15451182,0,Current status of antiviral therapy for juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are among the most prevalent of the sexually transmitted diseases, with up to 75% of women in the United States acquiring genital HPV infection at some point in their lives. HPV infections of the genital tract are of medical and public health concern due to their propensity to lead to the development of cervical cancer, and because they can be transmitted to the respiratory tract of a newborn child, resulting in juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JO-RRP). JO-RRP is the second most common cause of hoarseness among pediatric patients, and is the most common benign neoplasm in the larynx. The traditional treatment for JO-RRP is the physical removal of the wart through laryngoscopy and surgical debulking of the airway papillomas. Papillomas frequently recur following surgical resection, however, often necessitating repeated ablative efforts to maintain a patent airway. In a minority of patients, surgical management must be supplemented with adjuvant medical therapy, with interferon being the best studied and most commonly utilized. Recently, a Phase II investigation of a therapeutic vaccine yielded promising results, and a Phase III evaluation of this therapeutic modality is planned. Other adjuvant treatments currently being utilized, but for which controlled data of benefit are lacking, include cidofovir, indole-3-carbinol, ribavirin, mumps vaccine, and photodynamic therapy. As with surgical management, viral persistence occurs following treatment with these adjuvant modalities, further contributing to the challenge of managing patients with this potentially devastating disease."

CD008054,0,15860356,0,Association between the stages of cervical cancer and chromosome 1 aneusomy.,"The high-risk human papillomavirus is known to play a pivotal role in cervical carcinogenesis. Numerical and structural aberrations are known to be related to different behaviors of malignant cervical lesions. The aims of this study were (1) to assess the number of cervical cells with chromosome 1 aneusomy (monosomy, trisomy, and tetrasomy) in 20 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN 3, and invasive cancer) and three women without CIN by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), (2) to determine the heterogeneity of aneusomy among women within each of the five groups studied, (3) to determine the association between the four progressive stages of cervical cancer and the number of cells with and without aneusomy, (4) to determine the association between number of cells with and without aneusomy and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, and (5) to determine its usefulness as a biomarker of cancer risk. A hospital-based unmatched case-control study in a sample of 23 women grouped by disease stage and selected by histology from the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) in Mexico was conducted in 2002. Numerical aberrations of chromosome 1 in cervical smears were detected with FISH. HPV was detected with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and typing was performed with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLPs). Analysis of chromosome 1 aneusomy revealed (1) homogeneity among women within each one of the five groups, (2) a positive linear trend between the aneusomy frequency and grade of lesion, and (3) an association between aneusomy and high-risk HPV infection. These findings suggest the usefulness of the number of cervical cells with chromosome 1 aneusomy as a biomarker. In order to validate this biomarker we suggest a larger prospective study of cytological samples of patients with a longer follow-up."

CD008054,0,11802219,0,Burning wood in the kitchen increases the risk of cervical neoplasia in HPV-infected women in Honduras.,"There is suggestive evidence that the use of wood for cooking increases the risk of invasive cervical cancer. We investigated this association in women with cervical neoplasia in Honduras. Women aged 20-64 years with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade I (n = 44), CIN II (n = 36) or CIN III (n = 45) were recruited from screening programs in Tegucigalpa City and each was matched by age and clinic to 2 controls (241 total) without cervical abnormalities. The clinics selected women of low socioeconomic status. Cervical scrapes were tested for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA using a general primer set directed against the L1 open reading frame, and HPV genotyping was performed. Odds ratios (ORs) were computed through conditional logistic regression; p-values were from tests for linear trend of risk with increasing exposure. HPV DNA was detected in 48% of women with CIN I, 67% with CIN II and 89% with CIN III. The ORs were 1.5, 2.5 and 38.3 respectively. At univariate analysis, age at first intercourse was consistently lower among cases than controls. Risk was reduced by 50% or more in all 3 CIN classes when initiation of sexual activity at age 20 years or older was compared with initiation before age 16 years (p = 0.013 for CIN I). No effect was observed for smoking, oral contraceptives or previous cytologic screening. Effects for number of sexual partners, parity, age at first pregnancy and education were in the expected directions but never persisted after adjustment for HPV. Chronic exposure to wood smoke significantly increased the risk of CIN III (p = 0.022). However, women who said ""No"" when asked if they ever used wood in the kitchen had a higher risk than those with low or intermediate exposure. This was taken as evidence that the initial screening question had either been misunderstood or that answers were biased. Restricting the analysis to women who reported exposure yielded positive associations in all CIN classes with for CIN III ORs of 2.3 for 25-34 and 9.5 for 35+ years compared with women who had 1-14 years of exposure (p = 0.017). A multivariate analysis of the complete dataset (n = 366) allowed for separate ORs for HPV in each CIN class. Inclusion of age at first intercourse significantly improved this model (p = 0.021). Adding exposure to wood smoke further improved the model only if an interaction between woodsmoke and HPV was allowed for. If, as the data suggest, it was assumed that wood smoke had its effect among HPV-positives only, there was a significant linear dose-response relationship between exposure to woodsmoke and risk of CIN (p = 0.026). This association was independent of other risk factors including education, parity and number of sexual partners. ORs in the final model were 0.37 for age at first intercourse 20 years or higher and 5.69 for more than 35 years of exposure to wood burning in the kitchen. The present study suggests that the use of wood for cooking is a risk factor for cervical neoplasia that deserves further study, given its high prevalence in developing countries."

CD008054,0,18036888,1,Comparison of AMPLICOR and Hybrid Capture II assays for high risk HPV detection in normal and abnormal liquid-based cytology: use of INNO-LiPA Genotyping assay to screen the discordant results.,"The study was aimed to evaluate the feasibility of detecting human papillomavirus (HPV) in women with normal or abnormal cervical smears using the Roche Amplicor MWP HPV Test. We compared by AMPLICOR Test and Hybrid Capture II (HCII) Test, the prevalence of HR-HPV in 470 cervical samples including 55 samples with WNL cytology, 208 ASC-US, 193 LGSIL and 14 HGSIL. Samples with discordant results were retested with INNO-LiPA Genotyping HPV Test v2. The HR-HPV positivity in WNL cytology samples was similar (21.8%) by AMPLICOR and HCII. In ASC-US, the HPV positivity was 42.3% by both tests. In LGSIL, HPV positivity was 66.3% and 66.8% by AMPLICOR and HCII, respectively. In HGSIL, 92.8% of samples were positive by AMPLICOR and 85.7% by HCII. The agreement of both tests was 96.2% with a Kappa value of 0.92. Eighteen cases were discordant: 9 HCII positive/AMPLICOR negative and 9 HCII negative/AMPLICOR positive. The INNO-LiPA test revealed HPV positivity in every case. Interestingly, all HCII+/AMPLICOR- samples were found to harbour HPV53. As for the HCII-/AMPLICOR+ samples, 8 demonstrated a multiple infection with HR 16- and/or 18- and/or 56-phylogenetically related HPV types. Moreover, two of these samples were co-infected with HPV6 and two other with HPV54. By using consensus HR-HPV as our reference HPV positivity, the sensitivity (96.6%) and specificity (100%) of AMPLICOR was similar to that of HCII Test. The AMPLICOR HPV Test is sensitive, specific, feasible and appropriate for routine HPV detection."
CD008054,0,15980688,0,Survival after cancer diagnosis in persons with AIDS.,"The survival of persons with AIDS (PWA) has recently improved because of better antiretroviral therapies. Similarly, the prognosis of cancer has also improved. To determine if survival in PWA with cancer has also improved, we compared cancer survival in adults with and without AIDS using data from New York City from 1980 through 2000. Analyses were made for AIDS-related cancers (Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL], and cervical cancer) and for 8 non-AIDS-related cancers (lung, larynx, colorectum, anus, Hodgkin lymphoma, breast, prostate, and testis). Death hazard ratios compared survival in PWA with cancer with that in cancer patients without AIDS, adjusted for age, sex, race, and calendar-time of cancer occurrence. The 24-month survival rate of PWA with cancer (9015 AIDS cancers and 929 non-AIDS-related cancers of 8 types) improved significantly for most cancer types. By 1996 through 2000, the 24-month survival rate in PWA was 58% for Kaposi sarcoma, 41% for peripheral NHL, 29% for central nervous system NHL, and 64% for cervical cancer. For non-AIDS-related cancers, survival of PWA was lowest for lung cancer (10%) but was >50% for most other cancer types. In 1996 through 2000, significant differences in survival between cancer patients with and without AIDS still remained for Hodgkin lymphoma and lung, larynx, and prostate cancers. We conclude that recent improvements in AIDS and cancer care have greatly narrowed the gap in survival between cancer patients with and without AIDS. Clinicians should be encouraged by the improving prognosis and be diligent about detecting and treating cancer in PWA."

Fournier is the European development partner [244180]. Preclinical studies of E1A in mouse models for human breast and ovarian cancer demonstrated inhibition of expression of the her-2/neu oncogene, a significant reduction in tumors and increased survival rate in the treated animals [244180]. Results of a phase I study of intratumoral liposomal-E1A gene therapy in patients with recurrent/refractory breast cancer and head and neck cancer were presented at the 1998 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting. Results demonstrated that intratumoral delivery of the E1A gene caused a subsequent downregulation of HER-2/neu expression and tumor response. The phase I dose-escalation study treated nine patients with recurrent breast cancer and nine patients with head and neck cancer. In 16 patients evaluable for response, nine had stable disease, five had progressive disease and two had minor responses despite tumor progression at other sites. In one of six patients who had repeat biopsies of treated tumors, no pathological evidence of tumor was found. In four of seven patients evaluated to date (May 1998), evidence of downregulation of HER-2/neu was reported [287387,290118]. The first phase I trial in patients with breast and ovarian cancer was completed by the end of 1997. The second phase I trial, enrolling 12 to 24 patients with solid tumors, was initiated in April 1997. Its aim was to determine dosing and safety of tgDCC-E1A and evaluate levels of gene transfer and tumor response. Patients were administered tgDCC-E1A by intratumoral injections. The company completed this trial by the end of 1997. In October 1998, Targeted Genetics initiated a multicenter, open-label phase II clinical trial of tgDCC-E1A in patients with recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who have exhibited disease progression despite standard therapies. The study to be conducted at six medical institutions in the US will enrole up to 60 patients with an interim analysis scheduled to be performed after the first 20 evaluable patients have been enrolled. Patients will be treated with ten direct intratumoral injections of the E1A gene over a period of 8 weeks, with follow-up performed at week 12. Patients who demonstrate a response will be eligible for continued treatment and will be monitored for 1 year [300424]. Targeted Genetics has issued three patents covering methods and compositions of use of the E1A and LTgenes (qv) to treat a variety of cancers. US-05651964 covers the use of the E1A gene, US-05643567 and US-05641484 cover the use of either the E1A gene or the LT gene as cancer therapies. These three patents provide the company with broad patent protection for tgDCC-E1A and all future products based on the use of the E1A or LT gene as tumor suppressors [259808]."

An initial complete response rate of 75% was obtained, with a recurrence rate of 25%, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with late manifestation was of higher grade. Treatment interruption due to side-effects was not necessary. Associated viral infections appeared to be a recurrence risk factor, but not smoking or parity. While immunomodulatory treatment with beta-interferon has good long-term results in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I/II treatment, wider randomized studies are required to obtain conclusive results."
CD008054,0,14675322,0,The effect of codon 98 of the FHIT gene on cervical cancer in Korean women.,"The Fragile Histadine Triad (FHIT) is a putative tumor suppressor gene involved in different tumors. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of codon 98 of FHIT on cervical carcinogenesis. The study subjects were patients who were pathologically diagnosed with cervical neoplasia and who had a positive result for human papillomavirus (n = 567) compared to normal healthy women as normal controls (n = 506). The FHIT-specific sequences of DNA from peripheral blood samples from study subjects were determined by PCR using allele-specific primers and were compared with those of the controls. The genetic susceptibility of codon 98 of the FHIT gene (3p14.2) in cervical carcinogenesis was determined by examining the effect of the gene and environmental factors vs. the different stages of cervical intraepithelial lesions and the different histopathologic types of invasive cervical cancers. On assessing FHIT polymorphisms, the percentages of individuals homozygous for the T allele, homozygous for the C allele, and heterozygous for these two alleles were 42.1%, 11.3, and 46.6% in the control group. The corresponding figures were 39.5%, 14.8%, and 45.7% among in women with cervical cancer. Compared with FHIT T/ T, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for FHIT C/C was 1.4 (0.8-2.5) for invasive cervical cancer and 1.7 (0.9-3.1) for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II or III. The risks for invasive cervical cancer were higher with early onset cervical carcinogenesis (2.3, 1.0-5.5, P = 0.0438), than with late onset (1.0, 0.5-2.1, P = 0.9306). The risks of FHIT C/C or C/ T also increased for ever smokers or women with two or more children compared with FHIT T/ T. Polymorphisms of FHIT are associated with a higher risk of developing cervical cancer, in particular early onset cervical carcinogenesis."

In this study from Egypt's only population-based registry, we analyzed data from 1999 to 2006, to estimate incidence, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) categorized by age, district and subsites. Overall urban incidence of HNC was twice or more that of rural incidence for both males (IRR=2.59; 95% CI=2.26, 2.97) and females (IRR=2.00; 95% CI=1.64, 2.43). Highest urban-rural difference for males was seen in 40-49years (IRR=2.79; 95% CI=1.92, 4.05) and for females in 30-39years (IRR=2.94; 95% CI=1.60, 5.40). Among subsites, highest incidence among males was for larynx (1.53/10(5)) and among females for gum and mouth (0.48/10(5)). Maximum urban-rural difference in males was for paranasal sinus (IRR=4.66; 95% CI=1.88, 11.54) and in females for lip (IRR=8.91; 95% CI=1.89, 41.98). The study underscores the patterns of HNC incidence in Egypt while indicating the need for future analytical studies investigating specific risk factors of HNC in this population."

The study was designed as a prospective study using regression tree analysis of demographic data in consecutive patients who were subjected to colposcopic evaluation at the colposcopy clinic at the First Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Milan (Milan, Italy). A total of 177 women were subjected to colposcopy because of a single routine Pap smear showing mild dyskaryosis. A structured interview, sampling for HPV testing for the detection of viral DNA by hybrid capture methodology, and colposcopic evaluation with cervical biopsies were performed for each subject. The accuracies of molecular hybridization for HPV and of the classification model based on the demographic and lifestyle variables in predicting patients with histologically high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions were measured. The classification model based on the demographic and lifestyle variables showed comparable results with molecular hybridization for HPV (specificity, 0.75 versus 0.73; sensitivity, 0.61 versus 0.67, respectively). The use of demographic and lifestyle variables appears to be a simple and economic possibility for triaging patients with mild dyskaryotic smears in a screening program."

Cytological findings or testing for high risk (HR)-human papillomavirus (HPV) are inadequately sensitive for use in triage of women at high risk for cervical cancer. The current study is an exploratory study to identify candidate surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) protein profiles in plasma that may distinguish cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 3) from CIN 1 among women infected with HR-HPV. We evaluated the SELDI-TOF-MS plasma protein profiles of HR-HPV positive 32 women with CIN 3 (cases) and 28 women with CIN1 (controls). Case-control status was kept blinded and triplicates of each sample and quality control plasma samples were randomized and after robotic sample preparations were run on WCX2 chips. After alignment of mass/charge (m-z values), an iterative method was used to develop a classifier on a training data set that had 28 cases and 22 controls. The classifier developed was used to classify the subjects in a test data set that has six cases and six controls. The classifier separated the cases from controls in the test set with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity suggesting the possibility of using plasma SELDI protein profiles to identify women who are likely to have CIN 3 lesions."

Human papillomavirus is the single most important etiological agent in cervical cancer, contributing to neoplastic progression through the action of viral oncoproteins, mainly E6 and E7, which interfere with critical cell cycle pathways, p53 and retinoblastoma. However, evidence suggests that human papillomavirus infection alone is insufficient to induce malignant changes and that other host genetic variations are important in the development of cervical cancer. This article will discuss the latest molecular profiling techniques available and review the published literature relating to their role in the diagnosis and management of cervical dysplasia and cancer. It is hoped that these techniques will allow the detection of novel biomarkers at DNA, RNA, microRNA and protein levels, which may ultimately play a role in facilitating early disease diagnosis and in predicting response to therapies, thus allowing the development of personalized treatment strategies."

Although surgical lasers have a good overall safety record, they do expose patients, physicians, and other clinical staff to serious risks. Laser hazards can cause injury, disability, or even death: hospital staff have been burned by misdirected laser beams, technicians and maintenance personnel have received eye injuries while working on lasers and have been exposed to hazardous chemicals while changing laser dyes, and patients have died from injuries resulting from fires ignited by laser energy. Laser accidents most commonly result from misdirection of the laser beam. Direct or reflected radiation can burn skin, hair, or, more seriously, the cornea or retina, causing permanent damage. Misdirected laser energy can also cause ignition of surgical drapes, tracheal tubes, or the patient's hair. Also, a frequent by-product of laser-tissue interactions is laser plume, or smoke. Its acrid smell and particulate matter irritate the eyes, nose, and lungs and cause nausea; it is also a suspected vector for transmitting infectious materials, such as the human papilloma virus (HPV) associated with condyloma (a wartlike lesion) and cervical cancer. The risks are not limited to patients and those directly involved in using and maintaining lasers. Many laser procedures are performed in areas outside the controlled environment of the surgical suite; patients in a waiting area or even passersby could conceivably walk into an accessible laser treatment room, such as a doctor's office, and inadvertently be exposed to a direct or reflected beam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Cervical carcinoma patients' prognosis correlates significantly with staging (according to FIGO classification). In early stages lymph-node involvement is considered as the most important prognostic factor. Other factors are: initial volume of the lesion, lymphatic and blood vessels involvement, depth of cervical invasion. Also parametrium involvement seems to decrease the rate of 5-year survival. The aim of the research was to estimate correlation between HPV DNA lymph node presence and pathologic parameters of primary tumour in surgically treated cervical carcinoma patients. We analysed DNA isolated from lymph nodes sampled intra-operatively from 134 patients, surgically treated for cervical cancer with PCR. We confirmed the presence of HPV DNA sequences in lymph nodes in 81 (60.5%) cases. Lymph node presence of HPV DNA rate was significantly higher in: advanced tumours, cases with initial lesion volume exceeding 10 cm3, cases with uterus and vaginal involvement and with initial tumour invasion deeper than 10 mm."

CD008054,0,15753010,0,The role of human papillomavirus testing in cervical screening.,"Organised, cytology-based cervical screening has led to a reduction in deaths associated with cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is necessary for the development of cervical cancer and associated pre-cursor cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and accumulated evidence suggests that incorporation of HPV testing could further refine screening programmes. HPV testing is discussed in the context of primary screening, for triage, and as a test of cure of treatment and possible value in developing countries. The high negative predictive value of a ""double negative"" cytology and HPV result could allow considerable changes in policy such as increased intervals between screening rounds, adjustment of age ranges for testing and schedule for return to routine screening post treatment. HPV testing for the triage of women to colposcopy with borderline or atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) cytology could be clinically effective, but may be limited in women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) or mild dyskaryosis by high HPV prevalence. Markers of HPV persistence harbour enormous potential to identify women at greatest risk of disease progression. Due to the diversity of existing cytology-based screening programmes, full cost-effectiveness analyses of HPV testing should be performed and assessed within local contexts."

The prevalence and persistence of HPV genotypes and HPV16 variants were analysed in 112 HIV-positive and 115 HIV-negative Italian women. HIV-positive women were more likely than HIV-negative women to be infected by HPV at the initial examination (39.3 vs 13.9 %, P<0.001) and to have a higher period prevalence of HPV infection over a 3-year follow-up (43.8 % vs 17.4 %, P<0.001), regardless of CD4+ cell counts and anti-retroviral therapy. 'High-risk' and 'probable high-risk' HPVs (types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, 58 and 66), among the 20 different viral genotypes identified, were predominant in HIV-positive (33.9 %) compared with HIV-negative (13.9 %) women. Among HIV-infected women, with normal cytology as well as with SIL of any grade, the most common genotypes were HPV16 followed by HPV81, -58, -72, -33 and -62. HPV16 isolates from 18 HIV-positive and eight HIV-negative women were classified into variant lineages based on sequencing analysis of E6 and E7 genes and the long control region. Whilst the HPV16 G350 European variant was prevalent in both HIV-positive (10.7 %) and -negative women (3.5 %), HPV16 African 2 variant was only detected in HIV-positive women (3.6 %), suggesting different sexual mixing behaviours. The increased prevalence of uncommon viral genotypes and HPV16 variants in HIV-positive Italian women underscores the need to target a wide range of HPV types in cervical screening of high-risk women."
CD008054,0,1731281,0,Treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia using the loop electrosurgical excision procedure.,"In selected patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), outpatient ablative procedures represent a readily accepted and highly effective treatment modality. The recently introduced loop electrosurgical excision procedure offers a quick and simple alternative to cryotherapy and laser ablation for treating CIN, and has the distinct advantage of allowing both diagnosis and treatment of selected patients at a single visit. This report presents our clinical experience treating 432 patients with CIN using the loop electrosurgical excision procedure on an outpatient basis. Small loop electrodes were used to excise CIN lesions in 275 patients, and large loop electrodes were used in 157. When performed on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia, loop excision was well tolerated by patients with only minimal discomfort. Post-treatment bleeding occurred in less than 2% of the subjects and responded to either recauterization or packing of the cervix. Post-treatment stenosis occurred in less than 1%. The success rate of the loop electrosurgical excision procedure, as defined by absence of cytologic, histologic, or colposcopic lesions 4-48 months after therapy, was 80% for women treated using the small loop electrodes. Ninety percent of all patients treated using the large loop electrodes were free of disease during 6-12 months of follow-up. For women being treated for primary (as opposed to recurrent) disease, the success rate with large loop electrodes was 94%."

The cytological and colposcopic protocols of follow-up raise the problem of their insufficient sensitivity, and the compliance of the patients to this prolonged follow-up is low. Test HPV seeking the presence of high-risk HPV benefits from a high sensitivity and presents altogether a very strong negative predictive value. The addition of this test to the cytological monitoring three to six months after the conization makes it possible to distinguish a group of patients with low risk (with both tests negative) being able to profit from a traditional follow-up, from a high-risk group having at least one positive test, whose surveillance must be reinforced (with triage by colposcopy), prolonged in time and extended beyond the cervix. Like as the primary screening of cervical lesions, the follow-up of the patients after conization must profit from the addition of test HPV and would deserve protocolization and organization."

Developing countries account for 80% of the world burden, mostly due to the lack of effective control programmes. Infection with oncogenic types of human papillomaviruses (HPV) has been established as the central cause for cervical cancer. Thus, vaccination against HPV is a potentially useful strategy for prevention, but this may take several years to become a reality. Currently, early detection and treatment is the most effective approach to control cervical cancer. Cervical cancer may be controlled through improving awareness and accessibility to diagnostic and treatment services. Cytology-based screening is beyond the capacity of health services in many developing countries, hence, alternative methods to cytology are being investigated. Visual inspection of the cervix after application of 3-5% acetic acid (VIA) seems to be a promising screening test, with a similar sensitivity to that of cytology, but lower specificity. Currently, it is being evaluated for its cost-effectiveness in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality in randomized trials. Information from the ongoing studies will be valuable for evolving cervical cancer control policies and programmes in low-resource settings."

CD008054,0,18945407,0,Recommendations for cervical cancer prevention in Latin America and the Caribbean.,"Cervical cancer control in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region has been, and remains, a priority and a major public health challenge. It also provides the opportunity for the advancement of research into novel cervical cancer preventative tools including the use of prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, HPV-based screening options and low technology visual inspection methods. The challenges for prevention are compounded because cervical cancer cases continue to cluster in the low socio-economic and rural populations, thus requiring strong political and social commitments to ensure effective implementation in the region. Although cytology-based screening activities exist in the majority of LAC countries, these have been largely based on opportunistic screening services. Evaluation of the impact of screening is often focused on assessing coverage of the population with Pap smears. However, regardless of the chosen technology a screening program requires a complex set of activities that must also be of high quality such us ensuring access of the underserved populations to the program, maintaining routine quality controls of the screening procedures and organizing the proper follow-up of women with abnormal screening results. The cost of the HPV vaccine and of the delivery infrastructure required is currently a significant obstacle for widespread introduction that will require collaborative resolve between public health organizations, governments and vaccine manufacturers. It is important to ensure that HPV vaccines are made available to the wider public, not only to those who can afford it. This monograph and the associated regional reports have carefully identified and discussed the many challenges and opportunities to be considered for policy decisions, in particular the complex interplay between vaccination strategies and subsequent screening requirements. An advanced cost-benefit analysis, using models calibrated to specific countries in the region, presents the range of options and relative costs thus providing evidence-based scientific guidance to governments and providers in the context of a significant and systematic international review effort."

Two vaccines are now available for primary prevention of HPV infection and their introduction offers new opportunities to enhance comprehensive cervical cancer prevention and control. Currently, HPV vaccine price is a significant barrier to rapid vaccine introduction and access. Therefore, making evidence-based decisions about whether and how to introduce HPV vaccine into the immunization schedule in the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) requires a rigorous analysis of several factors. These include: estimates of disease burden, cost-effectiveness, operational feasibility of reaching a population of adolescent females and other key analyses that have been used in recent years to support the introduction of other vaccines, such as rotavirus and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Given the large number of public health priorities that are competing for limited public resources, developing and using a sound evidence base is of particular importance for vaccines, like HPV, which are currently available only at prices higher than other vaccines now in use. HPV vaccination provides the opportunity to dramatically improve women's health and partnerships must also be broad-based and effectively coordinated. This can be achieved by developing programs based on the lessons learned from vaccination strategies used to eliminate rubella and neonatal tetanus and for scaling up influenza vaccination in countries of LAC."
CD008054,0,19891902,0,ARTISTIC: a randomised trial of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in primary cervical screening.,"Primary cervical screening uses cytology to detect cancer precursor lesions [cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stage 3 or beyond (CIN3+)]. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing could add sensitivity as an adjunct to cytology or as a first test, reserving cytology for HPV-positive women. This study addresses the questions: Does the combination of cytology and HPV testing achieve a reduction in incident CIN3+?; Is HPV testing cost-effective in primary cervical screening?; Is its use associated with adverse psychosocial or psychosexual effects?; and How would it perform as an initial screening test followed by cytology for HPV positivity?"
CD008054,0,18945403,0,Mathematical models of cervical cancer prevention in Latin America and the Caribbean.,"Using population and epidemiologic data for 33 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), a model-based approach estimated averted cervical cancer cases and deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (I$/DALY averted) for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of young adolescent girls. Absolute reduction in lifetime cancer risk varied between countries, depending on incidence, proportion attributable to HPV-16 and 18, and population age-structure; for example, with 70% coverage, cancer reduction ranged from 40% in Mexico to more than 50% in Argentina. Screening of women over age 30 three times per lifetime, after vaccinating them as pre-adolescents, is expected to provide a relative increase of 25% to 30% in mortality reduction. Countries with the highest risk of cancer (age-standardized rate > 33.6) accounted for only 34% of deaths averted with vaccination, highlighting why a regional universal vaccination approach will be most effective in reducing the overall global burden. At I$25 per vaccinated girl ($5 per dose), for all 33 countries, the cost per DALY averted is less than I$400; at I$10 ($2 per dose) the vaccine is cost saving in 26 out of 33 countries. For all countries, ratios become less attractive (i.e., increase) as the cost of the vaccine increases. For example, at current vaccine prices ($120 per dose), the cost per DALY averted is I$7,300 in Mexico, I$3,700 in Nicaragua, and I$6,300 in Costa Rica. Vaccine price has an even greater effect on predicted affordability. For the 33 countries, vaccinating 5 consecutive birth cohorts at 70% coverage would cost $360 million at $5.00 per dose, $811 million at $12.25 per dose, and $1.26 billion at $19.50 per dose. In the LAC region, if effective delivery mechanisms can achieve high coverage rates in young adolescent girls, vaccination against HPV-16 and 18 will provide similar health value for resources invested as other new vaccines such as rotavirus. If the cost per vaccinated girl is less than I$25 HPV-16/18 vaccination would be very cost-effective in all 33 countries; for it to be affordable, costs may need to be lower."
CD008054,0,18945402,0,New approaches to cervical cancer screening in Latin America and the Caribbean.,"Cervical cancer remains an important public health problem in the Latin America and Caribbean region (LAC), with an expected significant increase in disease burden in the next decades as a result of population ageing. Prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is currently unaffordable in LAC countries. However, even if vaccination was implemented, an additional two decades will be required to observe its impact on HPV related disease and cancer. With some exceptions, cytology-based screening programs have been largely ineffective to control the problem in the region, and there is a need for new approaches to the organization of screening and for use of newly developed techniques. Several research groups in LAC have conducted research on new screening methods, some of which are summarized in this paper. A recommendation to reorganize screening programs is presented considering visual inspection for very low resource areas, improvement of cytology where it is operating successfully and HPV DNA testing followed by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) or cytology as soon as this method becomes technically and economically sustainable. This could be facilitated by the incorporation of new, low-cost HPV DNA testing methods and the use of self-collected vaginal specimens for selected groups of the population. An important requisite for screening based on HPV testing will be the quality assurance of the laboratory and the technique by validation and certification measures."
CD008054,0,21120710,0,Small lymphocytic lymphoma obscuring microscopic tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma: an unknown occurrence with a known primary.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) often presents with cervical lymph node metastases and at times the primary tumor cannot be identified despite extensive workup. Lymphoma is the second most common neoplasm in the head and neck region but is seldom synchronous with HNSCC and rarely involves regional mucosal sites. We report herein a rare occurrence of tonsillar involvement by small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) incidentally detected during the workup for a cervical lymph node SCC metastasis of a 52-year-old non-smoker male. The microscopic human papillomavirus-positive SCC involving the tonsillar surface and crypts was obscured by SLL leading to the initial designation of 'unknown primary'. The occult HNSCC are likely explained by small tumor size, quality and quantity of sampling, thoroughness of endoscopic, radiological and pathological assessment or a combination of the above. The coexistence of another tumor such as lymphoma has not yet been reported as a confounding factor in the workup for cervical SCC metastasis. Since oropharyngeal SCC can be very small and Waldeyer's ring is a common site for lymphoma involvement, identification of such rare collision tumors requires pathologists' awareness, extensive sampling and occasionally ancillary studies for the accurate diagnosis and staging essential for the correct management."
CD008054,0,1317558,0,What's new in diagnosis and treatment of HPV-associated cervical lesions.,"The human papilloma virus (HPV) has been subject to intense discussion during the last decade, as evidence has accumulated to strongly suggest that viruses play an essential part in the genesis of cervical neoplasms. The contamination rate of the female population is reported to range between 5 and 80%, depending on the modality of detection. Many indications almost reliably suggest the oncogenicity of certain HPV-types. The highest progression rate was found in HPV 16 lesions, followed by HPV 18 lesions. In our material the incidence of HPV 16/18 and 31/33 infections compared to 6/11 was elevated in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) compared to women with non-CIN lesions. The exact histologic diagnosis of CIN lesions is essential for a differentiated therapy. Our data indicate that mild and moderate CIN lesions are detected more frequently by Pap smear and colposcopically directed punch biopsy than by cervical smears alone. Histological diagnosis and HPV-typing by in-situ hybridisation offers the possibility to establish a differentiated therapy, e.g. by way of close follow-up, local destruction or cone biopsy. Main attention should be directed at early detection of dysplasia, at timely institution of follow-up programs and a possibly conservative therapeutic management."

CD008054,0,19713100,0,Process performance of cervical screening programmes in Europe.,"Standardised tables of aggregated data were collected from 15 European national or regional cervical screening programmes and key performance indicators computed as reported in European Union (EU) Guidelines, 2nd edition. Cytological results varied widely between countries both for the total proportion of abnormal tests (from 1.2% in Germany (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) to 11.7% in Ireland-Midwest Region) and for their distribution by grade. Referral rates for repeat cytology (ranging from 2.9% of screened women in the Netherlands to 16.6% in Slovenia) or for colposcopy (ranging from 0.8% in Finland to 4.4% in Romania-Cluj) and the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of colposcopic attendance (ranging from 8% in Romania-Cluj to 52% in Lithuania) were strongly influenced by management protocols, in particular for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology. However, cytology-specific PPV also showed remarkable variability. The detection rate of CIN2+ histology ranged from <0.1% of screened women in Poland to >1% in England and Denmark. Low attendance for colposcopy after referral was observed in some east-European countries. These comparisons may be useful for improving the performance of cervical screening in general and more so if new screening technologies and vaccination for Human Papillomavirus are introduced. Overall, quality was better in countries that have operated organised programmes for a longer time, plausibly as a result of long-lasting monitoring and quality assurance activities. Therefore, the availability of these data, the first comparing European countries, and the increased number of countries that can provide such data (only five in 2004) represent progress. Nevertheless, there is a clear need to standardise the cytological and histological classifications used in screening, as well as data registration systems across Europe."
CD008054,0,16911774,0,Adenoid basal lesions of the uterine cervix: evolving terminology and clinicopathological concepts.,"The epithelial proliferations that are designated adenoid basal carcinoma (ABC) in the current classification from the World Health Organization represent <1% of all cervical malignancies. These lesions may be associated, and occasionally show morphologic transitions with, conventional cervical malignancies. The determination of the precise frequency with which these so-called ABCs show this association is hampered by the inherent selection bias in the reported cases. However, this frequency appears to be substantial (>15%). The biologic course of ABCs that are associated with separate malignancies is largely dependent on the clinicopathologic parameters of the associated malignancies. Morphologically pure lesions, in contrast, have largely been associated with favorable patient outcomes, as none of the 66 reported patients have experienced tumor recurrence, metastases or tumor-associated death, irrespective of the modality of treatment. Although the finding of genome integrated high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types and p53 alterations in adenoid basal lesions (ABL) argue in support of their neoplastic nature, we identified no lines evidence that suggest an inherent malignancy for morphologically pure lesions. The finding of morphologic transitions between ABLs and conventional malignancies and shared HPV types in these areas, suggest that ABLs have some malignant potential. However, the precise magnitude of this potential is not readily quantifiable and should not dictate the management of morphologically pure lesions that are entirely evaluable. ABLs continue to occupy a unique position in human oncology in which the term carcinoma (without an in-situ suffix) is applied to a tumor that has not been shown to recur, metastasize or cause death. We concur with a previous proposal that the term ABC should be discarded and replaced with Adenoid Basal Epithelioma (ABE). In our opinion, there is insufficient evidence at present time to expose patients with morphologically pure lesions to the ominous implications--social, psychological, medical, financial--of a ""carcinoma"" diagnosis. Morphologically impure lesions should not be designated ABC or ABE. Furthermore, given the uncertainties regarding the frequency with which ABE are associated with separate malignancies, we suggest that the ABE designation only be applied when the tumor in question is entirely evaluable e.g in a hysterectomy specimen or in an excisional biopsy with negative margins. Otherwise, the generic designation Adenoid Basal Tumor is preferable. This approach strikes an appropriate balance between the need to prevent over-treatment of pure lesions on one hand, and the need to ensure that the lesions are indeed pure on the other."

CD008054,0,20607682,0,Evaluation of p16 immunostaining to predict high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in women with Pap results of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance.,"p16 immunostaining has been examined to detect high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade (CIN2+) in Pap cytology specimens. However, the utility of p16 in predicting CIN2+ in Pap specimens with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasm (ASC-H), is controversial. In this study, we evaluated the utility of p16 immunostaining for predicting CIN2+ in 78 Pap specimens with ASC-US/ASC-H and compared the results in high-risk HPV DNA and the follow-up biopsies. p16 immunostaining was positive in 47% (37/78) of the Pap specimens. Of the 13 Pap specimens with follow-up biopsy results of CIN2+, 7 (54%) were positive for p16. p16 positivity in the Pap specimens was not significantly associated with a CIN2+ biopsy result (P = 0.76). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of p16 immunostaining for predicting CIN2+ were 54%, 52%, 19%, and 85%, respectively. High-risk HPV DNA was detected in 40% (31/78) of the Pap specimens. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of HPV DNA for predicting CIN2+ were 100%, 72%, 42%, and 100%, respectively. High-risk HPV genotypes were detected in six p16-negative specimens with follow-up biopsy results of CIN2+. Our findings suggest that the utility of p16 immunostaining for predicting CIN2+ in Pap specimens with ASC-US/ASC-H is limited. Scant abnormal cells in Pap specimens with ASC-US/ASC-H may have contributed to the low p16 sensitivity."
CD008054,0,20473931,0,A survey of methylated candidate tumor suppressor genes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare malignancy with unique genetic, viral and environmental characteristic that distinguishes it from other head and neck carcinomas. The clinical management of NPC remains challenging largely due to the lack of early detection strategies for this tumor. In our study, we have sought to identify novel genes involved in the pathogenesis of NPC that might provide insight into this tumor's biology and could potentially be used as biomarkers. To identify these genes, we studied the epigenetics of NPC by characterizing a panel of methylation markers. Eighteen genes were evaluated by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in cell lines as well as in tissue samples including 50 NPC tumors and 28 benign nasopharyngeal biopsies. Significance was evaluated using Fisher's exact test and quantitative values were optimized using cut off values derived from receiver-operator characteristic curves. The methylation status of AIM1, APC, CALCA, deleted in colorectal carcinomas (DCC), DLEC, deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1), estrogen receptor alpha (ESR), FHIT, KIF1A and PGP9.5 was significantly associated with NPC compared to controls. The sensitivity of the individual genes ranged from 26 to 66% and the specificity was above 92% for all genes except FHIT. The combination of PGP9.5, KIF1A and DLEC had a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 92%. Ectopic expression of DCC and DLC1 lead to decrease in colony formation and invasion properties. Our results indicate that methylation of novel biomarkers in NPC could be used to enhance early detection approaches. Additionally, our functional studies reveal previously unknown tumor suppressor roles in NPC."
CD008054,0,19435020,0,An assessment of the readiness for introduction of the HPV vaccine in Uganda.,"Formative research assessing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine readiness in Uganda was conducted in 2007. The objective was to generate evidence for government decision-making and operational planning for HPV vaccine introduction. Qualitative research methods with children, parents, teachers, community leaders, health workers, technical experts and political leaders were used to capture understanding of socio-cultural, health system and policy environments. We found low levels of knowledge about cervical cancer and HPV. Vaccination and its benefits were well-understood; respondents were positive about HPV vaccination. Health systems were deemed adequate for HPV vaccine delivery. Schools were identified as a vaccination venue, given high attendance by girls aged 10-12 years. Communication and advocacy strategies to foster acceptance should provide information on cervical cancer, HPV vaccine safety, and side effects. Policymakers requested further detail on costs. Introduction of HPV vaccine could be integrated into existing reproductive health and immunization policies."

Identification of MMR gene mutations can have direct clinical implications in counseling and management of HNPCC families. We screened 44 HNPCC and 97 suspected HNPCC Korean families for germline mutations in three MMR genes: MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6. We identified twelve novel mutations: nine in MLH1(c.632_633insT, c.808_811delACTT, c.845C>G, c.1625A>C, c.1730+1delG, c.1907T>C, c.1918C>T, c.2104-2A>G and c.2170T>A), two in MSH2 (c.1886A>G, c.1316_1318delCCT) and one in MSH6 (c.3488A>T).

Interestingly, the most frequent mutation, c.1757_1758insC in MLH1, was a founder mutation inherited from a common Korean ancestor."
CD008054,0,18997735,0,Loss of INI1 expression defines a unique subset of pediatric undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas.,"Malignant rhabdoid tumor has traditionally been defined by its histologic phenotype. However, genetic investigations of malignant rhabdoid tumor have revealed a characteristic loss of or mutation in the INI1 gene on chromosome 22q. The occurrence and significance of soft tissue tumors meeting genetic criteria for malignant rhabdoid tumor but with an undifferentiated non-rhabdoid histology is poorly characterized. Seventeen undifferentiated sarcomas, lacking rhabdoid histology were identified either through the surgical pathology files of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (1980-2005) or in consultation. Immunohistochemistry for the INI1 protein showed a loss of nuclear expression within tumor cells in five of these cases. On histologic review, these five tumors had a featureless sheet-like architecture; four were small round blue cell tumors, and one showed focal spindling. Although they had variably prominent nucleoli, classic rhabdoid morphologic features were not identified in any of these cases at primary presentation. Additional immunohistochemistry showed a polyphenotypic profile. Four of the five tumors showed genetic abnormalities involving the INI1 gene by a combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and/or mutational analysis. Patient ages ranged from 1 week to 5 years. Four patients were male, and one was female. Sites included two neck tumors, two extremity tumors, and one paraspinal tumor. Two patients are alive and well over 15 years from the time of diagnosis; the remaining four are alive and well but with less than 2 years follow-up. Thus, alterations of the INI1 gene with consequent loss of expression identified a population of undifferentiated sarcomas lacking classic rhabdoid morphology in young patients, with evidence of favorable survival. Whether these undifferentiated sarcomas represent a clinicopathologic entity distinct from classic malignant rhabdoid tumor requires further investigation."

CD008054,0,8083669,0,Variability of polymerase chain reaction-based detection of human papillomavirus DNA is associated with the composition of vaginal microbial flora.,"The results of repeated human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing were compared to changes in cervical pathology and the composition of vaginal microorganisms. A cohort of 19 women with HPV cervical infections in the absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at enrollment was reexamined on average at 7.3-month intervals over a 2-year period. At each follow-up visit, cytological and colposcopic examinations were done and vaginal microorganisms were assessed quantitatively by Gram staining of secretions, and anaerobic and aerobic culture. HPV genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 were detected by polymerase chain reaction analysis using DNA isolated from exfoliated cervical cells. The detection of HPV DNA was significantly associated with carriage of Grade II flora (P < 0.001), isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis (P = 0.03), Ureaplasma urealyticum (P = 0.04), Candida albicans (P = 0.01), Bacteroides species (P = 0.01), and overgrowth by anaerobes (P = 0.004). Normal vaginal flora, characterised by the predominance of Lactobacillus species, was significantly associated (P < 0.001) with a negative HPV test. The detection of HPV DNA is associated with the composition of microorganisms present in the vagina at the time of testing."
CD008054,0,10711235,0,Screening for cancer: future potential.,"Much progress has been made in cancer screening over the past decade, but a great deal more needs to be done if screening is to make a major impact on worldwide cancer mortality. Where fully implemented, cytological screening for cervical precursor lesions has had a major impact on mortality. However, the cost and required infrastructure levels are high, and new approaches are needed if screening is to be effective in the developing world. Testing for the human papillomavirus and automated liquid based cytology offer great promise to improve quality, reduce overall cost and make screening more viable generally. Breast screening has been less successful, although useful mortality benefits have been achieved in women aged over 50 years. Full implementation in countries that can afford it will save lives, but radical new approaches will be needed to conquer breast cancer. Colorectal cancer screening offers the best hope of a major reduction in cancer mortality over the next decade. Less certainty exists about screening for other major cancers such as lung, prostate and ovary, but a range of potential approaches merit investigation."

CD008054,0,14768988,0,Management and follow-up of abnormal Papanicolaou tests.,"Although less prevalent than breast cancer, cervical cancer has a lower 5-year survival rate. Cervical cancer is nearly always due to human papillomavirus (HPV). Increased screening and DNA typing for oncogenic HPV have begun to reduce the number of cases. Interpretation of Papanicolaou test results and disease management decisions require a comprehensive grasp of recent revisions in classification and management practice. This article reviews the recommendations of the multidisciplinary Bethesda 2001 Workshop and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology. Practice changes include: new criteria for using liquid-based collection, a streamlined borderline category of atypical squamous cells (ASC), and a new category of ASC-cannot exclude high-grade lesion (ASC-H). Management includes colposcopy for all categories suspicious for epithelial abnormality and clearer guidelines for diagnostic colposcopy and endocervical sampling for glandular cell abnormalities (AGC, AGC-favor neoplasia). Adolescents and postmenopausal women have some variations from the recommended protocol. Reflex HPV DNA typing reflects the advances in research regarding risks for progression to cervical cancer. Treatment options include surgical removal of the lesions via laser, cryosurgery, loop excision, or cold-knife conization. Medical options include local treatments of cervical condyloma with tricloroacetic acid or 5-fluorouracil. Visible and sometimes functional cervical changes may result. Clinicians now have clearer guidelines with which to manage abnormal Papanicolaou test results, using the latest technology and research.

CD008054,0,17197917,1,p16INK4A immunohistochemistry is superior to HPV in situ hybridization for the detection of high-risk HPV in atypical squamous metaplasia.,"In situ hybridization (ISH) assays for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) and immunohistochemical (IHC) assays for surrogate markers such as p16 can be useful in detecting HR-HPV in cervical dysplasia, but the use of these markers in problematic cervical biopsies has not been well-established. We evaluated 3 chromogenic ISH assays (Ventana INFORM HPVII and HPVIII and DakoCytomation GenPoint) in conjunction with p16 IHC and HPV polymerase chain reaction in a study set consisting of 12 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 16 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 30 benign cervix samples. A test set of 28 cases of atypical squamous metaplasia were also evaluated withVentana HPVIII ISH and p16 IHC. In the study set, the sensitivity of the DakoCytomation ISH assay (which detects HPV subtypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) was similar to the Ventana HPVII assay but less than that of the Ventana HPVIII ISH assay (both of which detect HPV subtypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 66) and less than p16 IHC (55.6% vs. 53.6 vs. 69.2% vs. 82.1%). All HPV ISH assays exhibited 100% specificity. p16 reactivity consisted of 2 patterns: focal strong and diffuse strong. Because focal strong p16 reactivity was identified in benign squamous epithelium (6.7% cases) and dysplastic epithelium, it was considered an equivocal result and only diffuse strong reactivity was considered to be specific for the presence of HR-HPV. In the squamous intraepithelial lesions study set, the difference in sensitivity between Ventana HPVIII ISH and p16 was not statistically significant. However, in the atypical squamous metaplasia test set cases, p16 reactivity (focal strong and diffuse strong) was significantly more sensitive than Ventana HPVIII ISH in correlating with the presence of human papillomavirus as detected by polymerase chain reaction (83.3% vs. 33.3% P=0.004). Because focal strong p16 reactivity is less specific, cases with this staining pattern are considered atypical and require further evaluation by other means. Overall, p16 IHC is considered the best candidate for the initial assessment of cervical biopsies that are histologically indeterminate for dysplasia given its wide availability, comparative ease of interpretation, and high sensitivity and specificity."
CD008054,0,15922369,0,DNA adducts as markers of exposure and risk.,"Many carcinogens exert their biological effects through the formation of DNA adducts by metabolically activated intermediates. Detecting the presence of DNA adducts in human tissues is, therefore, a tool for molecular epidemiological studies of cancer. A large body of evidence demonstrates that DNA adducts are useful markers of carcinogen exposure, providing an integrated measurement of carcinogen intake, metabolic activation, and delivery to the target macromolecule in target tissues. Monitoring accessible surrogate tissues, such as white blood cells, also provides a means of investigating occupational or environmental exposure in healthy individuals. Such exposure to carcinogens, e.g. to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, has been demonstrated in several industries and in defined populations, respectively, by the detection of higher levels of adducts. Adducts detected in many tissues of smokers are at levels significantly higher than in non-smokers, although the magnitude of the elevation does not predict the magnitude of the risk. While such associations do not demonstrate causality, they do, importantly, lend plausibility to observed associations between smoking and cancer. However, there is still resistance to the notion that such monitoring can inform, rather than merely confirm, epidemiological investigations of cancer causation. Interestingly, smoking was recently causally linked to cervical cancer after years of being considered a confounding factor; yet smoking-related adducts have been known to be present in cervical epithelium for some time. In the few prospective studies thus far, elevated adduct levels have been found in individuals who subsequently developed cancer compared with individuals who did not. The potential for biomarker measurements, such as DNA adducts, to provide answers to the origin of many cases of human cancer for which an environmental cause is suspected, needs to be exploited more fully in future epidemiological studies."

In order to determine whether HLA antigen-controlled immunoregulatory functions have a role in the pathogenesis of HPV infections, class I and II HLA antigen typing was carried out on a series of 96 randomly selected women who were part of a cohort of 530 women prospectively followed up for cervical HPV infections in our clinic since 1981. The frequency of the DQ3 antigen, which has previously been reported to be increased among cervical cancer patients, was decreased in our HPV patients compared with the control group of Finnish women, but it was slightly increased in HPV16-infected women (P = 0.0812). However, we were able to demonstrate that HLA-DR5 antigen is significantly increased (i) in patients with high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (P < 0.02), and (ii) in women harbouring the high risk HPV type 16 (P = 0.0003), thus confirming earlier reports of an association of this HLA antigen and cervical cancer. Such a close association between the high risk HPV type 16 with an HLA antigen might have important implications in the possible immunogenetic basis of the increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix."

Quantitative DNA analysis by flow cytometry (FCM) holds promise as a more objective method fo diagnosis of malignancy. We performed traditional cytologic examination and single-parameter FCM DNA analysis on peritoneal washings from 136 gynecologic laparotomies, compared these results with the final pathologic findings, and analyzed sources of error. A total of 50 laparotomies were performed for benign disease. Another 86 were performed for cervical, endometrial, and ovarian carcinomas and various other cancers. In the benign group, cytology had one false suspicious but no false positive results, and FCM showed only diploid cells. In the cancer cases, cytology had five suspicious and 13 positive results and one false negative from laboratory error. On review, 16 washings contained confirmed cancer cells. FCM, performed in 13 of these cases, was diploid in 10 and aneuploid in only 3. In six of the diploid cases, visual cell counts showed that tumor cells were present in concentrations of 2.5% or less of total cells.

CD008054,0,21245659,0,An overview on the implementation of HPV vaccination in Europe.,"The discovery that the Human PapillomaVirus (HPV) is the necessary cause of cervical cancer has led to the development of prophylactic vaccines. Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer among young women in Europe: mortality is still high, despite its important reduction due to screening programs for early detection. Besides cervical cancer, HPV is responsible for a significant proportion of other anogenital cancers and an increasing number of oropharyngeal cancers, representing together an at least equal burden compared to cervical cancer. HPV is also responsible for conditions such as condyloma acuminata (genital warts) and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Organized vaccination programs against HPV have the potential to prevent about 70% of cervical cancers and the vast majority of the other HPV-related conditions. Recommendations for HPV vaccination of at least one cohort of females have been issued in nearly all western European countries, and national/regional publicly funded vaccination programs have been introduced in most of them. Different approaches have been chosen for the implementation of HPV vaccination, based on the organization of each country's health care system. A brief outline of these programs in Europe is presented. As for all preventive public health interventions, high coverage of the target population with HPV vaccines pre-exposure is essential to achieve maximum reduction of cases: therefore, in order to obtain the maximum and most equitable coverage and future benefit, programs targeting adolescents before exposure to HPV should be preferred and population-based. Catch-up programs should also be implemented wherever possible, in order to deliver more and even earlier benefits, and effective communication strategies need to be adopted."

CD008054,0,9034728,0,Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance: correlative histologic and follow-up studies from an academic medical center.,"The diagnosis of ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) was introduced in the 1988 Bethesda System for reporting cervical/vaginal cytologic findings. Outcome and appropriate management of patients with this diagnosis is not presently established. Criteria defining ASCUS are nuclear enlargement (2.5-3.0 times normal intermediate cell nucleus), mild nuclear hyperchromasia, smooth nuclear outlines with mild variation in nuclear size and shape, or else two, but not all three, cytologic criteria for human papilloma virus (HPV) cytopathic effect. All 668 cases reported as ASCUS from February 1992-December 1993 from our cytology laboratory were reviewed. These ASCUS cases represented 4.5% of all gynecologic cases diagnosed in that same time period. Of these, 284 (41%) had a subsequent colposcopic biopsy and/or endocervical curettage. The biopsied cases included 101 (36%) with condylomata, 38 (13%) with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, 17 (6%) with CIN II, and 9 (3%) with CIN III. No cases of carcinoma were detected. Of patients with a cytologic diagnosis of ASCUS and subsequent cervical biopsy, 49% had low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (LGSIL), either condyloma or CIN I. Nine percent had high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, either CIN II or CIN III. These findings indicate that ASCUS defines cytologically a group of patients who may have either a concurrent or subsequent development of a squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). This forms a high-risk group. The management of cases with a cytologic diagnosis of ASCUS should be at least as aggressive as that of LGSIL."

We searched published data for the period between 1995 and 2007 using the following inclusion criteria; (1) studies using type-specific HPV tests, (2) data from Korean female, (3) with cytologic or pathologic results, (4) having more than 20 cases for each subgroup classified by cytologic results, and (5) HPV detection including types 16, 18, and at least one other type. In total, 18 studies (13,842 cases) published up to April 2007 were identified and selected. Adjusted overall HPV prevalence was 23.9% (95% CI: 23.8-24.1%) in women with normal cytology and 95.8% (95% CI: 95.4-96.2%) in women with cervical cancer. Type 16 was predominant regardless of cervical disease status, and type 58 occupied a significantly larger proportion in high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancer in Korean women. HPV types 58, 33, and 52 together accounted for about 20% of infections in cervical cancer and high-grade intraepithelial lesions. After introduction of HPV prophylactic vaccines, extended protection, especially against types 58, 33, and 52, will be an important issue for cervical cancer prevention in Korea. The future dominant genotypes will require follow-up epidemiological studies with a large-scale, multicentered, and prospective design."

CD008054,0,12951683,1,Role of HPV DNA testing in predicting cervical intraepithelial lesions: comparison of HC HPV and ISH HPV.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is widely accepted as the primary agent involved in the development of squamous intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical carcinoma. Several commercial tests are available for detecting HPV DNA. This study compares the efficacy of INFORM HPV (in situ hybridization [ISH] HPV) and HCII (HC HPV) in predicting cervical lesions. A total of 762 sequential Papanicolaou (Pap) smears determined by cytologic examination to be either atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) were tested by both Hybrid Capture (HC) HPV and ISH HPV; 250 follow-up biopsies were reviewed as the reference standard for presence or absence of a lesion. ISH HPV and HC HPV differed significantly in accurately predicting biopsy findings from ASC-US and LSIL cases. The overall sensitivity and specificity of ISH HPV were 97% (28/29) and 86% (191/221); and HC HPV was 79% (23/29) and 56% (123/221). The positive predictive value (PPV) of ISH HPV was 48% (28/58) vs HC HPV value of 19% (23/121). Negative predictive value (NPV) was also better with ISH HPV at 99% (191/192) and HC HPV at 95% (123/129). Of equal importance, ISH HPV demonstrated a lower false-positive rate compared to HC HPV, 12% (30/250) vs 39% (98/250), as well as having a slightly lower false-negative rate 0.4% (1/250) vs 2.4% (6/250). ISH HPV is more predictive of biopsy histopathology in patients with detectable cervical lesions than is HC HPV. Effective triage of patients by HPV analysis using ISH HPV as compared to HC HPV has the potential of significant public health impact by reducing unnecessary colposcopies, as well as adverse medical, social, and psychological patient consequences."

CD008054,0,16681744,1,Analyses of atypical squamous cells refined by the 2001 Bethesda System: the distribution and clinical significance of follow-up management.,"This study was conducted to analyze the clinical significance of follow-up diagnostic methods of atypical squamous cells (ASC) (the 2001 Bethesda System) cases according to age. A computerized search of the cytology database was performed to retrieve all cases diagnosed as ASC from 2001 to 2003. The pathologic reports for all follow-up diagnoses were reviewed. We divided the patients into two groups according to their age, younger than 50 years of age and 50 years and older, and follow-up diagnoses were compared between the two groups. ASC was identified in 1035 (2.0%) of 49,882 women screened, and a total of 914 patients were eligible. In atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) cases, colposcopically directed biopsy showed CIN I (CIN is cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) or higher grade lesions in 34.9% of cases younger than 50 years of age and in 17.4% of cases 50 years and older (P= 0.000). However, repeat Pap smears and human papillomavirus DNA testing showed no differences between the two groups. In contrast, the three methods did not exhibit significant difference between the two groups in patients with atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H) (P= 0.743). Colposcopically directed biopsy for the ASC-US was more useful in patients younger than 50 years of age than in those who were 50 years and older. It is suggested that age should be considered in deciding follow-up diagnostic methods in patients with ASC-US."
CD008054,0,16681749,0,Analysis of differential protein expression by cisplatin treatment in cervical carcinoma cells.,"Cisplatin (cis-diaminedichloroplatinum), a DNA-damaging agent, which readily induces apoptosis in vitro, is one of the widely used anticancer drug in the treatment of human malignancies. Cisplatin has played an important role in cervical cancer management for effective chemotherapeutic regimen, but the underlying mechanisms inducing cell death at protein level are unknown. Using proteome analysis, an investigation aimed at a better understanding of the antiproliferative mechanisms by cisplatin was carried out in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells. In total, 21 protein spots were found to be differentially expressed following cisplatin treatment, of which 12 were upregulated (eg, regulator of G-protein signaling, TRAF:TNF (tumor necrosis factor) receptor-associated factor-interacting protein [I-TRAF], and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 [p27(kip1)]) and 9 were downregulated (eg, myc proto-oncoprotein [c-myc] and proliferating cell nuclear antigen). Interestingly, we found the upregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which used molecular marker in cervical cancer screening. On the basis of proteomic data, we showed that cisplatin induced TRAF2-mediated NF-kappaB downregulation. In addition, our study demonstrated that cisplatin induced membrane death receptor-mediated and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway. Our findings may offer new insights into the antiproliferative mechanism by cisplatin and its mode of action in cervical carcinoma cells."

CD008054,0,20141237,0,A rare lymphoma in a patient with amyopathic dermatomyositis.,"A 37-year-old Caucasian woman was evaluated for a photosensitive dermatitis. A positive anti-nuclear antibody with a titer of 1 : 1280 and a speckled pattern was noted and she was diagnosed with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). Although the initial dermatologic diagnosis was SCLE, a skin biopsy suggested the additional possibility of dermatomyositis because of increased dermal mucin. We began following her at the request of the dermatology department, and a diagnosis of amyopathic dermatomyositis was made based on the lack of objective muscle weakness, normal muscle enzymes, negative double-stranded DNA, SSA/SSB, and RNP/Smith antibody panel, and especially on the cutaneous examination findings. A malignancy evaluation included a normal CT scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, mammography, pelvic ultrasound, Papanicolaou smear, and endometrial biopsy. She developed vaginal bleeding 1 year after the onset of her skin manifestations. Repeat gynecologic evaluation, including cervical biopsy, revealed a large B-cell cervical lymphoma. Amyopathic dermatomyositis and lymphoma of the cervix are both rare conditions. Our case emphasizes the importance of considering underlying malignancy at the time of diagnosis and while the patient is followed clinically. Additionally, the clinician must remain vigilant in evaluating any new clinical changes in follow-up care. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of lymphoma of the cervix in the setting of amyopathic dermatomyositis."

CD008054,0,20966891,0,Early cervical neoplasia: advances in screening and treatment modalities.,"Cervical cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer in women worldwide. However, improvements in screening programs and treatment modalities have significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality of this disease. The discovery that infection with the human papillomavirus is a crucial part of the causative pathway in cervical cancer pathogenesis has revolutionized screening and prompted investigations into alternatives to traditional cytologic evaluation, which may be useful in low-resource settings. Concomitant with improved screening has been a shift towards greater detection of both preinvasive and early-stage neoplastic disease. Earlier detection not only allows for surgical management of disease, with the avoidance of chemotherapy and radiation, but also the possibility of fertility preservation. As surgical technologies advance to encompass minimally-invasive procedures, interventions for early-stage cervical cancer are becoming increasingly effective in disease eradication while permitting patients to maintain their quality of life."
CD008054,0,17760847,0,Comparison of MY09/11 consensus PCR and type-specific PCRs in the detection of oncogenic HPV types.,"The causal relationship between persistent infection with high-risk HPV and cervical cancer has resulted in the development of HPV DNA detection systems. The widely used MY09/11 consensus PCR targets a 450bp conserved sequence in the HPV L1 gene, and can therefore amplify a broad spectrum of HPV types. However, limitations of these consensus primers are evident, particularly in regard to the variability in detection sensitivity among different HPV types. This study compared MY09/11 PCR with type-specific PCRs in the detection of oncogenic HPV types. The study population comprised 15, 774 patients. Consensus PCR failed to detect 522 (10.9%) HPV infections indicated by type-specific PCRs. A significant correlation between failure of consensus PCR and HPV type was found. HPV types 51, 68 and 45 were missed most frequently. The clinical relevance of the HPV infections missed by MY09/11 PCR was reflected in the fraction of cases with cytological abnormalities and in follow-up, showing 104 (25.4%) CIN2+ cases. The MY09/11 false negativity could be the result of poor sensitivity, mismatch of MY09/11 primers or disruption of L1 target by HPV integration or DNA degradation. Furthermore, MY09/11 PCR lacked specificity for oncogenic HPVs. Diagnostic accuracy of the PCR systems, in terms of sensitivity (MY09/11 PCR: 87.9%; type-specific PCRs: 98.3%) and specificity (MY09/11 PCR: 38.7%; type-specific PCRs: 76.14%), and predictive values for histologically confirmed CIN2+, suggest that type-specific PCRs could be used in a clinical setting as a reliable screening tool."
CD008054,0,20698112,1,Evaluation of the HPV L1 capsid protein in prognosis of mild and moderate dysplasia of the cervix uteri.,"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) can be detected in the cytologic smears years before invasive squamous cancer arises, but no reproducible morphologic criteria exist to predict behavior of cervical lesions. The possibility of predicting the clinical course of cervical lesions could be of high value in clinical practice and some women will spare of unnecessary treatment. HPV L1 capsid protein represents about 90% of the total protein on the surface of the virus and can be detected in mild to moderate dysplasia and rarely in severe dysplasia. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the use of immunodetection of HPV L1 protein on archival Pap smears with findings of mild and moderate dysplasia in predicting its clinical course. Immunochemical analyses with L1 antibody revealed positively stained nuclei of squamous epithelial cells in 56 of 114 smears (49.1%). The staining results were correlated with follow-up smears or with histologic verification. Regression (negativisation of the Pap smear for 24 months or longer) was noticed in 31 of 56 (55.4%) L1-positive cases and in 20 of 58 (34.5%) L1-negative cases. Persistent disease occured in 13 (23.2%) L1-positive cases and in 14 (24.1%) L1-negative cases. Progressive disease occured in 12 (21.4%) L1-positive cases and in 24 (41.4%) L1-negative cases. The difference in the clinical course between the L1-positive and L1-negative patients was statistically significant (p = 0.025). Also, the difference in the clinical course of the L1-negative staining in the under-30 and over-30 years age group was statistically significant (p = 0.04). For conclusion, our data confirm that immunostaining for HPV L1 capsid protein could offer prognostic information about mild and moderate intraepithelial cervical squamous lesions."

CD008054,0,12474770,0,[Some aspects of diagnosis and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (review of the literature)].,"Cervical cancer has remained close to the forefront of oncologic studies even in our days. The incidence of the disease has changed little, except in those countries with effective screening programs. The morbidity in Lithuania reached 23.9/100,000 in the 2000's, while in comparison the morbidity in the 1994's was 20.4/100,000. The mortality was 13.2 and 11.3/100,000, respectively. Over the last 50 years our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of lower genital tract squamous neoplasia has increased enormously and, particularly in the last 15 years, progress in our understanding of the molecular events associated with lower anogenital tract neoplasia has developed rapidly. Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women worldwide, after breast cancer. Since 1978 it is known that Human Papillomavirus is closely related to genital neoplasia--cervical, vulva, vagina, penis, anus intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive carcinoma. It is also known that cytologic smear is one of the most important way to diagnose cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer as well, because we can not evaluate cervical lesion visually. Cytologic smear remains the main principle of cancer screening because of its simplicity and accessibility, while colposcopy remains the method of examination in choice, when pathologic cytologic findings are determined."

The cohort is based on genotyping and follow-up of Hybrid Capture-positive women at Kaiser Permanente, Northern California. HPV DNA testing by Hybrid Capture 2 requires denaturation with alkali, possibly damaging the DNA for optimal PCR-based genotyping. A feasibility study was conducted on paired aliquots of anonymized specimens from 100 women with low-grade intraepithelial lesion cytology. Test aliquots were left in denaturant for 10 or 18h at 4 degrees C and then neutralized; comparison aliquots were not denatured but diluted to match the timing, temperature, concentration and salt conditions of the treated specimens. The masked aliquots were tested using a commercialized PCR-based assay that detects of 37 HPV genotypes. There was no overall effect of treatment on test positivity or number of types. HPV16 was marginally more likely to be detected in untreated versus treated aliquots (P=0.09) but HPV45 was marginally more likely to be detected in treated than untreated aliquots (P=0.07), suggesting that these differences represented chance (intra-test variability). It can be concluded that residual Hybrid Capture-positive specimens can be genotyped by PCR after Hybrid Capture 2 processing."
CD008054,0,9950005,0,Lower genital tract intraepithelial neoplasia in HIV-infected women: guidelines for evaluation and management.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) are both sexually transmitted viruses with many risk factors in common. Studies have found that HIV-seropositive women are at least five times as likely to be infected with HPV as seronegative controls. In immunocompromised HIV-seropositive women, the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is almost as high as in women with squamous intraepithelial lesions on their Pap smear. Some studies have shown the false-negative rate of cervical cytology in HIV-seropositive women to be very high, although others have shown it to be comparable with the rate in seronegative controls. However, given the prevalence of CIN in this population, even a ""normal"" false-negative rate may result in many missed CIN lesions. Among HIV-seropositive women and especially among those who are immunocompromised, CIN is more likely to progress and recur after treatment. Recurrence rates may reach 87 percent 36 months after treatment in markedly immunosuppressed women. Cryotherapy is especially ineffective in these patients. Vulvar condyloma and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) are much more prevalent in HIV-seropositive women and especially in those who are markedly immunosuppressed or who have been immunosuppressed for a prolonged period of time. It is recommended that all HIV-seropositive women undergo periodic evaluation at intervals no less than every 6 months. Immunocompromised women should be followed with cytology and colposcopy of the cervix and vulva, although those with normal immune systems may be followed with cytology alone.

CD008054,0,11045789,0,Tumor necrosis factor a-11 and DR15-DQ6 (B*0602) haplotype increase the risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in human papillomavirus 16 seropositive women in Northern Sweden.,"HLA genes have been shown to be associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), a precursor of cervical cancer. The human papillomaviruses (HPV) types 16 and 18 are the major environmental cause of this disease. Because the immune system plays an important role in the control of HPV infection, the association of polymorphic HLA could lead to a different immune response to control the development of cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between CIN and a microsatellite polymorphism of tumor necrosis factor (TNFa) taking HPV exposure and CIN-associated HLA haplotypes into account. In a nested case-control study in northern Sweden, 64 patients and 147 controls matched for age and sex and derived from the same population-based cohort were typed for TNFA, HLA-DR, and DQ and assayed for antibodies to HPV types 16 and 18. TNFa polymorphism was not associated with CIN per se. However, there was a significant increase in the frequency of TNFa-11 among HPV16-positive and HLA DR15-DQ6 (B*0602) patients compared with HPV16- and HLA-DQ6-negative patients (odds ratios, 5.4 and 9.3, respectively). The relative risk for CIN conferred by the combination of TNFa-11, HLA-DQ6, and HPV 16 positivity was 15. Our study suggests that the TNFa-11 allele is associated with HPV16 infection and associated with CIN in combination with HLA-DQ6 but not by itself."

CD008054,0,11392875,0,DNA ploidy and cyclin D1 expression in basal cell carcinoma of the head and neck.,"Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) may be subdivided into primary with a favorable biologic course (BCC1) and recurrent and/or metastatic (BCC2). No clear association between primary tumor location, histologic subtype, or other clinicopathologic variables and predisposition for BCC2 has been found. Histopathologic criteria are limited for prognostication. To identify prognostic factors useful for planning therapy, we studied cyclin D1 immunohistochemical expression, DNA ploidy, and epiluminescence light microscopic (ELM) patterns in 60 cases of BCC (30 BCC1 and 30 BCC2) in the head and neck region, half of which were hyperpigmented. Cyclin D1 was absent in 27 cases, expressed at low level in 4 cases, and overexpressed in 30 cases. Seven BCCs were euploid, 28 exhibited a mixed cellular population, and 25 were aneuploid. Among aneuploid tumors, hypodiploidy was found in 12. Among the 30 pigmented carcinomas, only 15 showed a typical ELM pattern. No association between pigmentation and more aggressive biologic behavior of BCC was found. These results and follow-up data seem to indicate that an unfavorable outcome can be predicted by hyperexpression of cyclin D1, aneuploidy, and an atypical ELM pattern for pigmented cases. A definite hypodiploid peak was associated with worse prognosis. The analysis of cyclin D1 expression and DNA ploidy may help identify BCC with an aggressive phenotype and a poor clinical outcome."
CD008054,0,17484617,0,Cervical screening in the 21st century: the case for human papillomavirus testing of self-collected specimens.,"Cervical screening by Pap smear involves a high rate of false negatives, necessitating frequent testing. Because women do not like the sampling procedure, many avoid being screened. Testing for the causative high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types, by PCR or other technologies, on self-collected (tampon) samples permits women to be monitored non-invasively. The high negative predictive value of HPV testing means a greater interval between tests, and thus reduces costs. HPV testing lends itself to primary screening. A kit for self-collection and return to a testing laboratory, followed by practitioner notification and follow-up if required, should result in wider participation. The higher accuracy of HPV testing should lead to improved cervical cancer prevention."
CD008054,0,15805425,1,Immunohistochemical expression of p16INK4a and bcl-2 according to HPV type and to the progression of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions.,"Inactivation of the cell cycle inhibitor gene p16MTS1 seems to be involved in human papillomavirus (HPV)-related carcinogenesis because E6 and E7 oncoproteins may impair p16INK4a and, indirectly, bcl-2 functions. In this study, we analyzed the role of immunohistochemical expression of p16INK4a and bcl-2 in HPV-infected cervical biopsies as prognostic markers of the progression of squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). Sixty-five cervical biopsies were stratified into two subgroups according to the second biopsy: 27 of them maintained a low-grade (LG)-SIL diagnosis, and 38 progressed from LG-SIL to high-grade (HG)-SIL. p16INK4a and bcl-2 quantitative expression levels were measured by the immunoperoxidase method. PCR-DNA techniques were used to detect and type HPV. The Wilcoxon and Fisher exact tests were employed for the statistical analysis. In the group with an LG-SIL diagnosis at the second biopsy, no significant associations were found between p16INK4a and bcl-2 expression and presence of HPV16/18. In the group that progressed to HG-SIL, a significant association was observed between p16INK4a overexpression and HPV16/18 presence (p=0.021), but none with bcl-2 levels. It is concluded that immunohistochemical bcl-2 expression may not be useful for predicting the progression of HPV-related SIL. In contrast, p16INK4a overexpression seemed to be associated with HPV 16 and 18, suggesting that it may be a good marker for predicting SIL progression."

CD008054,0,10088555,0,Atypical immature metaplasia (AIM) of the cervix: is it related to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL)?,"Atypical immature metaplasia (AIM) is a poorly characterized cervical lesion with uncertain biological and clinical significance. AIM shares some, but not all, morphological features of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs). SILs are characterized by human papillomavirus (HPV) positivity and increased cellular proliferation, but these features have not been fully evaluated in AIM. Genomic DNA was extracted from 27 microdissected cervical biopsy specimens diagnosed as AIM. HPV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using two different sets of L1 gene consensus primers. HPV types were identified by sequence analysis of PCR products and comparison with published HPV sequences. The cell proliferation index was assessed by immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 (MIB-1) antigen and expressed as the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells. Comparison groups included normal cervix (n = 10) and low-grade (LSILs, n = 19) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs, n = 11). Intermediate- or high-risk HPV DNA was detected in 67% (18 of 27) of AIM cases. Low-risk HPV DNA was not detected in any of the specimens. The Ki-67 index in AIM (mean, 33.0 +/- 20.3; median, 29) was comparable to that of LSILs (mean, 21.4 +/- 4.6; median, 21) and was significantly higher than that of normal cervix (mean, 11.0 +/- 2.1; median, 11) (P< .01) and lower than that of HSILs (mean, 60.4 +/- 13.2; median, 60) (P < .01). Of the cases with available follow-up, HPV-positive AIMs were significantly more likely to have a concurrent or subsequent diagnosis of typical HSIL (12 of 15, 80%) than HPV-negative AIMs (one of six, 45%) (P = .014). The wide range of Ki-67 indices and variable HPV status in AIM suggest that AIM represents a heterogeneous group of lesions including bona fide HSILs (high-risk HPV-positive, high Ki-67 index), antecedents (precursors?) of HSILs (high-risk HPV-positive, low to moderate Ki-67 index), and benign reactive conditions (HPV-negative, variable Ki-67 index). HPV testing may be useful in the assessment of atypical epithelial proliferations of the cervix for which a diagnosis of AIM is considered."

We report on a rare case of IM showing geographic lymph node necrosis as well as angiocentric lymphoproliferative lesions, and containing numerous centroblasts, immunoblasts and Reed-Sternberg (RS)-like cells. The patient was a 40-year-old Japanese man with signs and symptoms of classical IM. This was later confirmed serologically, but the necrotic area comprised 50% of a cervical lymph node. The large lymphoid cells, including RS-like cells, were CD3-, CD5-, CD15-, CD20+, CD30+, CD45RO-, CD79a+, LMPI+, and EBNA2+. In situ hybridization study also disclosed that these cells were associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The patient was disease free during a follow-up of 15 years. Although the classical IM syndrome rarely shows a close resemblance to lymphomatoid granulomatosis of the lymph node or to EBV+ B- cell lymphoproliferative disorders associated with an immunodeficient state on histology, it is important for pathologists to be aware of this type of lesion in diagnostic practice."

In addition, secondary prevention methods such as HPV screening, Pap testing, or visual inspection are uncommon in the developing world. The HPV vaccine will be first introduced into the industrialized countries and it will then, over the course of time, become used in the developing countries. HPV vaccine should be introduced in the framework of comprehensive cervical cancer control, and offers an opportunity to bring together a wide range of constituents who have not to date worked closely on vaccination. Ultimately, the decision of whether and when a vaccine will be introduced will depend on individual countries. To prepare for decisions on HPV vaccine use, the sexual and reproductive health (SRH; including adolescent health), immunization, and cancer control communities need to work together to analyze the appropriate data and build international and national consensus. The timeframe for other newer vaccines, such as hepatitis B and Hib, has been measured in decades, and the challenge to the public sector is to greatly shorten the time needed to make HPV vaccines available and affordable for the developing world, where their impact will be greatest."

The filter in situ hybridization method was used throughout. A total of 20,161 smears, taken from 11,667 women, were tested. When the results of only the first examination are considered, 8.8% (950/10,778) of women with normal cytology were positive for HPV DNA. If we divide the latter into age groups, 11% (852 HPV positive/7716) were below the age of 55 years and 3.2% (98 HPV positive/3062) were above this age. When the samples from patients who had undergone at least two examinations and remained cytologically negative during the 5-year period were examined (total, 2709 women), the HPV DNA positively increased to 34.7% (640/1862) for the sexually active age groups and to 9.0% (76/847) for those above 55 years of age. This study reveals that, although papillomaviral production is most pronounced in younger women, these infections are quite common in all age groups. During the period of investigation, 19 (0.65%) patients, who were diagnosed as cytologically negative at the first examination, progressed to carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma. Of these, 63.2% revealed a detectable HPV infection during the study period. The progression of HPV-positive women from normal cytology to CIN or cancer occurred at an annual frequency of 0.082%.

This article aims to review some recent developments in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, in particular the expanding role of chemotherapy in its management. Surgery and radiotherapy have remained the mainstay of therapy. Chemotherapy is increasingly being incorporated into the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Previously, radiotherapy following surgery was the standard approach to the treatment of locoregionally advanced resectable disease. Data from randomized trials have confirmed the benefits of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the adjuvant setting. Chemoradiotherapy is also the recommended approach for unresectable disease. Induction chemotherapy has been useful in resectable disease where organ preservation is desirable, but this approach was inferior for the goal of larynx preservation, while leading to similar survival when compared with concomitant chemoradiotherapy. There is recent evidence that taxanes added to induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil result in improved survival outcomes. Novel targeted agents, such as epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists, are showing promise in the treatment of patients with both locoregionally advanced and recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck."

These observations could potentially lead to new, specific and non-invasive tools for diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up in neoplastic disease, if found to be a more general phenomenon. To test if tumour DNA is also present in serum of patients with colorectal cancer, we selected 14 colorectal cancer patients with advanced disease. In seven patients, K-ras mutations were detected in the primary tumour, using mutant-specific primers for point mutations in codon 12 or 13 of the K-ras gene. All patients were analysed for mutant DNA in serum. Tumour-specific point mutations, corresponding to the K-ras mutations found in the primary tumour were detected in the serum of all patients but one. No mutant K-ras could be detected in the serum of seven patients without K-ras mutations in the primary tumour. These results may be useful in assessing tumour burden in patients with neoplastic disease. Moreover, consecutive testing of serum tumour DNA after surgery or chemotherapy may be used as a tumour marker for recurrent disease."

CD008054,0,20019841,0,Epigenetic silencing of CRABP2 and MX1 in head and neck tumors.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a heterogeneous disease affecting the epithelium of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx. Conditions of most patients are diagnosed at late stages of the disease, and no sensitive and specific predictors of aggressive behavior have been identified yet. Therefore, early detection and prognostic biomarkers are highly desirable for a more rational management of the disease. Hypermethylation of CpG islands is one of the most important epigenetic mechanisms that leads to gene silencing in tumors and has been extensively used for the identification of biomarkers. In this study, we combined rapid subtractive hybridization and microarray analysis in a hierarchical manner to select genes that are putatively reactivated by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5Aza-dC) in HNSCC cell lines (FaDu, UM-SCC-14A, UM-SCC-17A, UM-SCC-38A). This combined analysis identified 78 genes, 35 of which were reactivated in at least 2 cell lines and harbored a CpG island at their 5' region. Reactivation of 3 of these 35 genes (CRABP2, MX1, and SLC15A3) was confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR; fold change, >or=3). Bisulfite sequencing of their CpG islands revealed that they are indeed differentially methylated in the HNSCC cell lines. Using methylation-specific PCR, we detected a higher frequency of CRABP2 (58.1% for region 1) and MX1 (46.3%) hypermethylation in primary HNSCC when compared with lymphocytes from healthy individuals. Finally, absence of the CRABP2 protein was associated with decreased disease-free survival rates, supporting a potential use of CRABP2 expression as a prognostic biomarker for HNSCC patients."

Histologically, eight cases were classified as mixed cellularity type (50%), four as nodular sclerosis (25%), and one as lymphocyte predominance, nodular (LPn; 6.3%); three others that showed interfollicular involvement were unclassified (18.7%). The Reed-Sternberg (RS) and atypical mononuclear cells in most cases of mixed cellularity and interfollicular types and all cases of nodular sclerosis had the classic immunophenotype (CD45-, CD20- and/or CD45RO-, CD15+ and/or CD30+). In the single case of LPn, they were of B-cell lineage (CD45+, CD20+, CD45RO-, CD15-, CD30-). In situ hybridization performed on routinely processed sections revealed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBER1 mRNA in RS cells of eight of 12 cases studied (67%) only in mixed cellularity and nodular sclerosis, but not in LPn. We conclude that, however rarely, Hodgkin's disease of typical morphology and immunophenotype can originate in Waldeyer's ring. The incidence of EBV detection in the RS cells in our study is greater than that usually seen in nodal Hodgkin's disease in the United States. The greater prevalence of EBV-related Hodgkin's disease at this site is probably a reflection of the fact that the Waldeyer's ring is a reservoir for EBV."

CD008054,0,19651367,0,History of the use of HPV testing in cervical screening and in the management of abnormal cervical screening results.,"Twenty years have passed since the first studies using human papillomavirus (HPV) testing began in clinical settings. At that time controversy regarding the role of HPV in cervical carcinogenesis still divided the scientific world. Epidemiological and natural history studies on HPV and cervical cancer in the ensuing two decades secured the necessary role of high-risk (carcinogenic) HPV in the genesis of cervical cancer, providing the rationale for testing for its cause. Subsequently, cross sectional studies and large randomized trials have provided clinical validation for high-risk HPV testing in triage of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), in postcolposcopy management of women referred for ASC-US, atypical squamous cells ""cannot rule out high grade"" (ASC-H), atypical glandular cells ""not otherwise specified"" (AGC NOS) and low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and not found to have cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2+ or adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) at initial colposcopy, in post-treatment of CIN 2+ surveillance, and in cotesting with the Papanicolaou (Pap) test of women age 30 and over. This is the story of the road traveled that brought the clinical use of HPV testing from its genesis only a few years after Dr. zur Hausen's discovery to its present eminent role in both primary cervical cancer screening and abnormal Pap management."

To solve the dilemma between sensitivity and specificity, a new generation of assays focuses on the pathogenic factors that underlie the development of HPV-associated tumors: the expression of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7. Demonstration of persistent expression of these mRNAs or expression in the context of relevant clinical symptoms has a strong positive predictive value for the development of HPV-associated carcinomas and strongly warrants further diagnostic action."
CD008054,0,19651365,1,High-risk HPV detection and concurrent HPV 16 and 18 typing with Abbott RealTime High Risk HPV test.,"High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent of cervical cancer. Among the high-risk types, infection with HPV 16 and 18 is associated with significantly higher risk of disease progression, and consequently these two types together cause approximately 70% of invasive cervical cancer worldwide. Identification of HPV 16 and HPV 18 can provide valuable information for risk stratification and clinical management of patients infected with these two types in both ASC-US triage and primary screening in women over age 30. It may also be valuable in the assessment of HPV vaccine efficacy. Abbott RealTime High Risk (HR) HPV is a recently developed test for the detection of 14 high-risk HPV types with the ability to concurrently identify HPV 16 and 18."

CD008054,0,12807952,0,Chapter 14: Role of triage testing in cervical cancer screening.,"The classic model of cervical cancer prevention-primary screening with cytology, followed by diagnostic colposcopically directed biopsy, and finally treatment of cancer precursors-is undergoing dynamic change. The introduction of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing and other new modalities provides more options but increases complexity in the sequence of screening, triage, diagnosis, and patient management. This chapter will focus on the role of triage and risk stratification in management. The utility of HPV testing has been established for triage of cytologic findings of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance but not for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse. Countries without established cytology services may consider alternative screening, triage, and treatment programs that may be more readily implemented than a resource-rich ""cytology followed by colposcopy"" paradigm requiring an infrastructure of highly trained personnel. The diagnostic step of colposcopy and directed biopsy is not completely sensitive in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3 as is sometimes assumed. The partial insensitivity of this diagnostic step results in a population of women with negative colposcopically directed-biopsy findings but at increased risk for missed prevalent disease: these women may require additional triage rather than resumption of routine screening. As more efficient screening, triage, and diagnosis increase the sensitivity of detection of even very small CIN2 or CIN3, overtreatment of lesions that might otherwise regress becomes a concern and highlights the need to identify accurate markers of risk of progression to cancer. Markers of molecular events further along the pathway from HPV infection to development of cancer may ultimately provide more specificity in triage and diagnosis."

CD008054,0,9062150,0,Prognostic factors in patients with bulky stage IB or IIA cervical carcinoma undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical hysterectomy.,"All patients with bulky (> or =4 cm) Stage Ib or IIa cervical carcinoma treated at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between August 1988 and December 1991 using a strategy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin, vincristine, and bleomycin and radical hysterectomy were reviewed. Fifty-nine evaluable patients received 1 to 3 courses of chemotherapy, and 51 underwent subsequent hysterectomy. The remaining 8 patients, not completing planned surgery, were treated with definitive radiotherapy. The overall clinical response rate was 81.4% (48/59) with 18.6% complete response. Clinical response to chemotherapy was not different by stage, histologic type, tumor size, level of squamous cell carcinoma antigen, or DNA ploidy. However, tumors with DNA indices (DI) greater than 1.3 were associated with higher clinical response rates than tumors with DI < or = 1.3 (P = 0.043). Histologically proven pelvic node metastases was noted in 18.5% (10/54) who had laparotomy. Concomitant pregnancy and more than one node metastases had significant adverse influence on recurrence and death. The 5-year survival rate of those patients who received hysterectomy was 80.3%, while only 1 of the 8 patients without hysterectomy survived. Of the 7 patients received hysterectomy despite clinical poor response, only 2 had node metastases and 3 died, whereas all the 4 patients deterred hysterectomy for poor response died. This study demonstrates the value of DNA flow cytometry in predicting chemosensitivity. However, with a DI cutoff at 1.3, only 29.2% patients could be selected. Further studies are necessary to find additional indicators that predict histological response to select better candidates for this approach and to determine optimal adjunctive treatment in case that poor prognostic features are found."
CD008054,0,18267061,0,The potential utility of HPV genotyping in screening and clinical management.,"Detection of specific human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes, or HPV genotyping, may be useful for differentiating between those women who are carcinogenic HPV-positive at lower and higher risk for cervical precancer and cancer. Considerable evidence already exists that the absolute risk for cervical precancer and cancer varies considerably among specific HPV genotypes, and that detection of HPV-16 and -18 may have clinical usefulness, especially among women who tested positive for carcinogenic HPV and have negative cytology. Detection of persistent carcinogenic HPV is strongly associated with cervical precancer and cancer and strongly predicts its development, and might be used to monitor the outcomes of HPV infections. However, several practical considerations must be addressed before HPV genotyping can be used in screening and clinical management."
CD008054,0,18267062,0,Cytology versus high-risk HPV testing for follow-up of HPV-positive women without CIN.,"Screening for cervical cancer is often considered the success story for cancer screening in the United States. However, much room for improvement still exists. For example, experts have yet to establish the best follow-up strategy for women with an abnormal Papanicolaou test and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) followed by a normal colposcopy or biopsy that is negative for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The incorporation of HPV testing has allowed the development of a more sensitive and cost-efficient strategy. This article presents a brief overview of related guidelines and current modalities, and reviews selected studies. Finally, future directions and a possible schema for clinical management of these patients are included."
CD008054,0,18267063,1,Conservative management of adolescents with abnormal cytology and histology.,"Adolescents remain vulnerable to human papilloma virus (HPV) infection because of certain physiologic characteristics inherent in this age group and common sexual behaviors, including lack of condom use. The commonness of HPV in this age group also results in frequent abnormal cytology. Fortunately, most of the infections are transient, with frequent clearance of HPV and the lesion. Current strategies for adolescents with abnormal cytology include conservative management, avoiding invasive procedures. For cytologic atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), management can be obtaining cytology only at 1-year intervals for up to 2 years before referral for colposcopy is necessary. For biopsy-proven cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, management is similar with yearly cytology indefinitely or until high-grade-SIL or CIN II/III develops. CIN II in adherent adolescents can be managed with 6-month cytology and colposcopy."

The following short annexe to Chapter 3 of the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Cervical Cancer Screening provides a framework that will allow different terminologies and languages to be translated into standard terminology based on the Bethesda system (TBS) for cytology while retaining the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) classification for histology. This approach has followed extensive consultation with representatives of many countries and professional groups as well as a discussion forum published in Cytopathology (2005;16:113). This article will describe the reporting of specimen adequacy, which is dealt with in more detail elsewhere in Chapter 3 of the guidelines, the optional general categorization recommended in TBS, the interpretation/cytology result and other comments that may be made on reports such as concurrent human papillomavirus testing and the use of automation review and recommendations for management. The main categories in TBS will be described in the context of CIN, dyskaryosis and dysplasia terminologies so that all may be translated into the same framework. These guidelines should allow European countries to adapt their terminology in such a way as to make their screening programmes comparable with each other as well as with programmes elsewhere in the world."

The polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the paraffin-embedded cervical biopsies for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, 18 and 33 by polymerase chain reaction and molecular hybridization technique. Twenty biopsies contained HPV DNA, in 17 cases of the putatively oncogenic types HPV 16 and HPV 18. During a mean follow-up of 28 months, the lesions resolved in 37 women, 5 women had progression to CIN III lesions, and 4 women had persisting disease. Lesions not harboring any of the 5 HPV types showed a high spontaneous regression rate of 88%, which was not improved by the laser therapy. In the HPV-positive lesions, resolution occurred in only 29% of untreated lesions, but in 92% of those treated by laser. The difference is significant (P = 0.007). It is concluded that in patients with cervical koilocytosis, the HPV diagnosis could be of practical value in identifying patients who might benefit from treatment."

CD008054,0,19793686,0,[Basaloid squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck].,"Basaloid squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) are a rare variant of SCC of the head and neck. Their histological characteristics have been described by Wain in 1986 and are reported in the 2005 WHO classification. A poorer prognosis of BSCC has been reported. Two recent case-control studies have shown a higher rate of distant metastases (15-40%, mean over 30%). Conversely, BSCC have similar or better locoregional control rates, a relatively good radiosensitivity and locoregional control. The role of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, concomitant or adjuvant setting needs to be redefined due to high metastatic failure rates; chest CT or PET CT are recommended at baseline and every 6-month during follow-up. Some subgroups of BSCC (oropharynx in particular) are more likely to be associated with oncogenic human papilloma virus HPV16. The determination of BSCC head and neck subgroups by HPV status is critical for the prognosis. The basaloid sub-type of squamous cell carcinomas owing to its particular behavior, should be taken into account while deciding the optimal therapeutic strategy."

Consenting, nonpregnant study participants were identified from a cohort of 46,009 women receiving routine Pap smear screening in a managed care setting. Colposcopy was performed on all women, and at least one histological sample was obtained from each. Review diagnoses were assigned to smears and biopsy specimens by two separate panels of pathologists. DNA testing for cancer-associated HPV types was performed on rinses of cytological samplers after a smear and thin-layer slide had been made. On review, 47 (34%) smears were reclassified as negative, 44 (32%) as AGUS, 30 (22%) as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), and 16 (12%) as squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL). The 19 smears interpreted as high-grade intraepithelial lesions on review included 13 high-grade SIL (HSIL), two HSIL with AGUS, favor neoplastic (endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS]), and four AGUS, favor neoplastic (AIS). Review histological diagnoses were negative in 105 (77%), squamous or glandular atypia in four (3%), low-grade SIL (LSIL) in nine (7%), HSIL in 12 (9%), AIS in five (4%, including two with concurrent HSIL), and endometrial carcinoma in one (1%). HPV testing identified 11 (92%) of 12 women with histologically confirmed HSIL and all five with AIS (100%). A high-grade intraepithelial lesion or carcinoma is detected in approximately 14% of women with community-based diagnoses of AGUS who are referred for immediate evaluation.

A specific DNA repair enzyme, O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), can remove the alkyl group from the O(6)-position of the guanine, thereby preventing its mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. Inactivation of the MGMT gene in association with promoter hypermethylation results in persistence of O(6)-alkylguanine in DNA, leading to G:C to A:T transition mutation and these G:C to A:T transition mutations can inactivate p53 tumor suppressor gene or activate ras proto-oncogene."

In this study, we evaluated the role of PARP-1 in melanoma and its prognostic importance. We studied by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis PARP-1 expression in a selected series of 80 primary melanoma of the head and neck region. The results were correlated with tumor thickness and patient's outcome. A follow-up of at least 3 years was available. Fifteen cases of benign melanocytic nevi were used as controls. Normal melanocytes showed only scattered, focal nuclear positivity and were considered as negative for PARP-1 expression by immunohistochemistry (score, 0). Thirty cases of melanoma (37.5%) showed nuclear expression of PARP-1 in both radial and vertical growth phases. Western blot analysis showed the presence of a high signal for full-length PARP-1 only in the cases with high immunohistochemical (nuclear) expression of protein (score, ++/+++) in both radial and vertical growth phase. A significant correlation was present between PARP-1 expression in vertical growth phase and the thickness of tumor lesion (P = .014); all but one tumor measuring less than 0.75 mm showed no or low PARP-1 expression. No correlation was found between PARP-1 expression in radial growth phase and tumor thickness (P = .38, data not shown). These data suggest that PARP-1 overexpression is a potential novel molecular marker of aggressive cutaneous malignant melanoma and a direct correlation between PARP-1-mediated inhibition of the apoptosis and biologic behavior of cutaneous malignant melanoma."

Two years before, the patient had been diagnosed with follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (FL); she had been treated with four cycles of multiagent chemotherapy plus rituximab, the last cycle being administered 10 months before coming to our attention. An ultrasound (US) guided fine-needle cytology (FNC) showed an atypical lymphoid cell proliferation. The phenotype evidenced by flow cytometry (FC) analysis was D5: 10%, CD19: 49%, CD23: 10%, FMC7: 0%, CD10: 40%, CD10/19: 40%, lambda light chain 40%, kappa light chain 0%. FDG-positron emission tomography (PET/CT) scan showed positivity in the corresponding cervical area. Since low LDH values and a reduced lymph node size were observed, the lymph node was therefore excised; the histology revealed a reactive hyperplastic lymph node with florid follicular pattern. A subsequent PCR analysis, performed on DNA extracted from a whole histological section, did not evidence IgH rearrangement. The patient is currently undergoing strict clinical and instrumental follow-up, including PET every 3 months; after 13 months, she is alive without recurrence of lymphoma. Clonal B-cell populations in non-lymphomatous processes have been described in mucosa-associated lymphoid cell populations and reactive lymph nodes, and are considered non-malignant, antigen driven, proliferations of B-lymphocytes determined by an abnormal response to bacterial or viral antigen stimulation.

Recent investigation suggests that human papilloma virus (HPV) may serve as an etiology in such cases and represent a unique risk factor in a sub-set of patients. Irrespective of the etiology, in the majority of cases early carcinoma of the tonsil can effectively be treated using single modality therapy. While local-regional control and survival are similar following surgery or radiotherapy, primary surgery can be accomplished with minimal functional morbidity while reserving radiation for recurrent disease. In contrast, surgical salvage following external beam radiotherapy can be technically challenging and is often associated with a significant increase in surgical complications and functional morbidity. In contrast to early tonsillar disease, advanced tonsil cancer represents a clinical challenge that requires multimodality therapy. While advanced lesions are often treated with a combination of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgical ablation, management of the neck and distant metastases continues to present a therapeutic dilemma."

With 70% vaccination and screening coverage, lifetime risk of cancer was reduced by 20.4-76.1% with vaccination of pre-adolescent girls and/or screening of older women. Only when the cost per vaccinated girl was low (i.e., <I$25) was vaccination combined with screening (three times per lifetime or every 5 years) favored in both regions; at high costs per vaccinated girl (i.e., >I$100), screening alone was most cost-effective. When optimal policies differed between regions, implementing a national strategy resulted in health and economic inefficiencies. HPV vaccination appears to be an attractive cervical cancer prevention strategy for Vietnam, provided high coverage can be achieved in young pre-adolescent girls, cost per vaccinated girl is <I$25 (i.e., <$5 per dose), and screening is offered at older ages."
CD008054,0,16425530,0,[Presence of high risk human papilomaviruses (HPV) in the low grade cervical lesion].,"Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL) and atypical squamous cells undetermined significance (ASCUS) are the most frequent verified cellular abnormalities. Their management are still highly controversial mostly caused by uncertainty about their histology and nature of originate. Detection of HPV DNA in the absence of cytological abnormalities can also indicate presence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The aim of this study was to show the association of the benign cellular changes, ASCUS and LGSIL with oncogenic types of HPV and to prove the necessity of more intensive screening of this group of patients. Cytology and pathomorphology analyses were performed first. Identification of the presence of human papiloma virus was carried out by the Digene Hybride Capture II test for all patients. Identification of different HPV types for the particular number of patients was carried out by RFLP (Rsetriction Fragments Length of Polymorphism). Out of the 101 patients in the first group 92 (91,08%) were HPV positive, and 41, 58% had no cellular abnormalities, ASCUS or LGSIL. Out of 509 patients of the second group 26.92% were positive for HRHPV, and 78,97% of them had no cellular abnormalities, ASCUS or LGSIL. HPV 16 was detected in 27.36% (ASCUS/LGSIL) of low risk cervical lesion of the first examined period."

CD008054,0,16538218,0,Parallel cyclin E and cyclin A expression in neoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix.,"Cyclin E levels are high during late G1 and early S-phase in normal cells. The cyclin E expression over the cell cycle in tumours is not fully known. The impact on patient outcome by high cyclin E levels during other parts of the cell cycle than late G1- and early S-phase is unknown. We set out to study the expression of cyclin E over the cell cycle in cervical carcinomas. Using immunofluorescence staining of cyclin A, digital microscopy, and digital image analysis, we determined which cells in a tissue section that were in S- or G2-phase. M-phase cells were detected by morphology. By simultaneously staining for cyclin E, we investigated the variation in cyclin E levels over the cell cycle in cervical carcinoma lesions. In a case-control study, in which each deceased patient was matched with a patient still alive and well after >5 years of follow-up, we found that the deceased patients had a considerably higher fraction of cyclin A-positive cells staining for cyclin E than the survivors (n = 36). We conclude that parallel cyclin E and cyclin A expression is an indicator for poor outcome in cervical carcinomas. In addition, we investigated the expression pattern of cyclin E and cyclin A in consecutive biopsy samples from cervical carcinomas at different stages, as well as in human papillomavirus positive or negative adenocarcinomas in order to further study the cyclin E and cyclin A expression pattern in neoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix."

CD008054,0,12440827,0,Cervical biopsy specimens and human papilloma virus positivity in patients with external genital warts.,Cervical biopsy specimens were taken from 16 women with external genital warts in order to diagnose concomitant cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) according to pathology. Positive HPV infection was detected 56% (9/16) of the patients. Among those patients 66% (6/9) had concurrent subclinical low-grade CIN lesions. One of those patients had a high-grade CIN lesion. It is concluded that cervical HPV infection was rather common in women with external genital warts and it is valuable to examine cervical HPV infection by biopsy to detect concomitant CIN.

CD008054,0,19439079,0,Safety and preliminary efficacy data of a novel casein kinase 2 (CK2) peptide inhibitor administered intralesionally at four dose levels in patients with cervical malignancies.,"Cervical cancer is now considered the second leading cause of death among women worldwide, and its incidence has reached alarming levels, especially in developing countries. Similarly, high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), the precursor stage for cervical cancer, represents a growing health problem among younger women as the HSIL management regimes that have been developed are not fully effective. From the etiological point of view, the presence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) has been demonstrated to play a crucial role for developing cervical malignancies, and viral DNA has been detected in 99.7% of cervical tumors at the later stages. CIGB-300 is a novel cyclic synthetic peptide that induces apoptosis in malignant cells and elicits antitumor activity in cancer animal models. CIGB-300 impairs the Casein Kinase (CK2) phosphorylation, by targeting the substrate's phosphoaceptor domain.

CD008054,0,17526866,0,Multiparameter calibration of a natural history model of cervical cancer.,"The objective of this study was to develop a comprehensive natural history model of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer using a two-step approach to model calibration. In the first step, the authors utilized primary epidemiologic data from a longitudinal study of women in Brazil and identified a plausible range for each input parameter that produced model output within the 95% confidence intervals of the data. In the second step, they performed a simultaneous search over all input parameters to identify parameter sets that produced output consistent with data from multiple sources. A goodness-of-fit score was computed for 555,000 unique parameter sets using a likelihood-based approach, and a sample of good-fitting parameter sets was used in the model to illustrate the advantage of the calibration approach by projecting a range of benefits associated with cervical cancer prevention policies. The calibrated model had reasonable fit to the data in terms of duration and prevalence of HPV infection for high-risk types, prevalence of precancerous lesions, and incidence of cancer. The authors found that leveraging primary data from longitudinal studies provides unique opportunities for model parameterization of the unobservable nature of HPV infection and its role in the development of cervical cancer."
CD008054,0,19642095,0,Clearance of human papillomavirus infection after successful conization in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"The natural history of high-risk human papillomavirus (HRHPV) infection after successful treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is not well known. This study was performed to evaluate the rate and pattern of HRHPV infection clearance after successful conization for CIN and to analyze factors associated with such clearance. A total of 287 patients who underwent loop electrosurgical excision procedures (LEEP) owing to HRHPV-associated CIN were included. All patients had negative resection margins on LEEP specimens and underwent HPV testing with the hybrid capture II system at 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 18- and 24-month follow-up visits after LEEP. Persistent HPV infections were detected in 45.6%, 14.3%, 6.3%, 2.2%, 1.5% and 1.1% of patients at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after LEEP, respectively. Clearance rates did not differ by age, parity or severity of cervical lesion. However, clearance rates were significantly slower in patients with HPV DNA loads >500 RLU/PC before LEEP (p = 0.040). During 2 years of follow-up after LEEP, 24 patients had recurrent disease revealed by biopsy. The odds ratios for recurrent disease in patients with persistent HRHPV infection increased gradually from 5.17 at the 3-month follow-up visit to 12.54, 15.69 and 25.90 at 6-, 9-, 12- and 24-month follow-up visits, respectively. We conclude that HRHPV infection cleared gradually in most patients within 6 months of treatment. Clearance rates were significantly slower in patients with HPV DNA loads >500 RLU/PC. Persistent HPV infection was a significant positive predictor of recurrence."
CD008054,0,19641042,0,Racial survival disparity in head and neck cancer results from low prevalence of human papillomavirus infection in black oropharyngeal cancer patients.,"The burden of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is greater for blacks than for whites, especially in oropharyngeal cases. We previously showed retrospectively that disease-free survival was significantly greater in white than in black SCCHN patients treated with chemoradiation, the greatest difference occurring in the oropharyngeal subgroup. Oropharyngeal cancer is increasing in incidence and in its association with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection; HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients have significantly better outcomes (versus HPV-negative). These collective data led to the present analyses of overall survival (OS) in our retrospective cohort and of OS and HPV status (tested prospectively in pretreatment biopsy specimens) in the phase 3, multicenter TAX 324 trial of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation in SCCHN patients. Median OS in the retrospective cohort of 106 white and 95 black SCCHN patients was 52.1 months (white) versus only 23.7 months (black; P = 0.009), due entirely to OS in the subgroup of patients with oropharyngeal cancer--69.4 months (whites) versus 25.2 months (blacks; P = 0.0006); no significant difference by race occurred in survival of non-oropharyngeal SCCHN (P = 0.58). In TAX 324, 196 white patients and 28 black patients could be assessed for HPV status. Median OS was significantly worse for black patients (20.9 months) than for white patients (70.6 months; P = 0.03) and dramatically improved in HPV-positive (not reached) versus HPV-negative (26.6 months, 5.1 hazard ratio) oropharyngeal patients (P < 0.0001), 49% of whom were HPV-16 positive. Overall, HPV positivity was 34% in white versus 4% in black patients (P = 0.0004). Survival was similar for black and white HPV-negative patients (P = 0.56). This is the first prospective assessment of confirmed HPV status in black versus white SCCHN patients. Worse OS for black SCCHN patients was driven by oropharyngeal cancer outcomes, and that for black oropharyngeal cancer patients by a lower prevalence of HPV infection. These findings have important implications for the etiology, prevention, prognosis, and treatment of SCCHN."
CD008054,0,8237988,0,Risk factors associated with cervical human papillomavirus infections: a case-control study.,"As a part of the long-term prospective follow-up study conducted for women with genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in Kuopio University Hospital, Finland, since 1981, a case-control study was designed to assess risk factors for genital HPV infections. The cases (n = 691) were women who had been invited to attend the follow-up program on the basis of an abnormal cervical smear consistent with HPV-induced cytopathic changes, i.e., had a clinical HPV infection. The controls (n = 706) were a randomly selected group of women who had normal smears in the screening. Both groups were asked to fill in an extensive questionnaire focusing on detailed epidemiologic data on previous gynecologic and obstetric history, sexual practices, sexual partners, and smoking habits. In the multivariate analysis, eight variables emerged as independent risk factors for prevalent HPV infection. These variables could explain over 80% of the risk for infection. The risk for the infection varied with age, being highest in the age group 20-29 years, thereafter declining in the following 10-year age groups. The strongest independent risk factor was the number of sexual partners during the past 2 years (adjusted odds ratio = 12.1; 95% confidence interval 4.3-33.8 for five or more vs. one or no partners). Among the independent risk factors that increased the risk were also current smoking (adjusted odds ratio = 2.7; 95% confidence interval 1.7-4.3), warts in sexual partner(s) (adjusted odds ratio = 3.2; 95% confidence interval 1.6-6.5), and increasing frequency of sexual intercourse per week. Independent risk factors with a protective effect included a normal result in the last Papanicolaou smear, regular use of an intrauterine device as a contraceptive method, and good personal hygiene. No significant association between oral contraceptive use and risk for HPV infection was found. Condom use did not result in protection from the infection. The results of this study support the concepts that sexual intercourse is the main form of transmission among adults and that sexual promiscuity is the most important determinant for genital HPV infections."

The establishment of infection with high-risk genital HPV types as a causative factor in cervical cancer is a major breakthrough in understanding of this disease. Testing for the presence of high-risk HPV DNA should increase the ability to identify women who are truly at risk for cancer and true cancer precursors and to more efficiently plan further diagnostic evaluation. The 2001 revisions in TBS reflect our improved understanding of the epidemiology and natural history of cervical epithelial abnormalities and cervical cancer.

CD008054,0,19144268,0,No association of the NF-kappaB1 -94ins/delATTG promoter polymorphism with relapse-free and overall survival in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck region.,"The transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is known to play a major role in immune response, inflammation and, via apoptosis and proliferation, also in oncogenesis. Transcription of NFKB1, which encodes the subunit p50/p105 of NF-kappaB, seems to be influenced by an insertion/deletion polymorphism in its promoter region. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to investigate whether this polymorphism can serve as a putative prognostic marker in patients with Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Head and Neck region (HNSCC). The prognostic value of the -94ins/delATTG NFKB1 promoter polymorphism was analyzed in an unselected series of patients treated with curative intent for HNSCC, including all tumor stages with different therapeutical regimens. Genotyping was performed by means of pyrosequencing, using DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 364 patients with a median follow-up of 61 (2-143) months. The various genotypes were correlated with relapse-free and overall survival, as well as risk, compared to healthy volunteers. The NFKB1 polymorphism was not related to risk of HNSCC. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed no significant association between the -94ins/delATTG alleles and survival or disease progression of patients with HNSCC. In conclusion, the results suggest that the investigated NFKB1 promoter polymorphism has no prognostic impact on risk or clinical course in HNSCC."

CD008054,0,17337388,0,[Aberrant methylation of tumor suppressor genes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: is it clinically relevant?].,"During malignant transformation, the malignant cell accumulates epigenetic abnormalities that do not alter the DNA sequence but are transmissible during divisions and modify genes expression. The methylation of CpG islands in the tumor suppressor genes (TS genes) promoters inhibits their transcription ; it is a mecanism of gene inactivation as frequent as allelic deletions. The methylation profile (or panel of methylated genes in a tumor), similarly to allelic deletions, varies with the tumor histology. Within head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (oral cavity, larynx and oropharynx), 19 genes have been analysed, among them 5 are frequently methylated, i.e. : p16, ECAD, DAPK, MGMT et TIMP3. The method of methylation analysis, based on a bisulfite treatment followed by a PCR amplification, is sensitive and specific enough to allow the detection of abnormalities in biological fluid that drain the tumor or in circulating tumoral DNA. In the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, correlation between the methylation profile in tumor and paired saliva is excellent ; thus methylation analysis in saliva is a very promising approach for early cancer detection in high risk patients or for the post treatment follow up and rapid diagnosis of relapse. The methylation signature might also reflect the tumor prognosis and complete the histology to define the diagnosis. Finally, DNA methylation is reversible with demethylating agents, a new avenue for cancer therapy in association with conventional chemotherapy."

We found a significantly lower risk of development of cervical neoplasia in H63D carriers (OR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.35-0.92; p = 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirms this observation (OR = 0.55; 95% CI 0.35-0.88, p = 0.01). Regarding the C282Y mutation no association was found (OR = 1.32; 95% CI 0.53-3.33; p = 0.52). In addition, a significant difference between H63D carrier and non-carrier women on the time-to-onset of cervical lesions was observed (log-rank test: p = 0.0012).

Seventy-five surgically removed primary papillary thyroid carcinomas larger than 30 mm in diameter were obtained from patients over 60 years of age. A subtotal thyroidectomy with modified radical neck dissection was performed in all patients. Sixteen female patients died of the carcinoma (non-survivors) and 18 survived longer than 12 years without recurrence (survivors). Histologically, papillary carcinoma was subclassified into poorly and well differentiated types, and the presence of stromal bone formation was noted. Flow cytometry was performed using paraffin-embedded materials. The incidence of the poorly differentiated type was 2/18 among the tumors of survivors and 6/16 among the tumors of non-survivors (P = 0.08). Stromal bone formation was only found in the tumors of the survivors (6/18 and 0/16; P = 0.014). In flow cytometry, tumors of the survivors showed a DNA diploid pattern (14/14), whereas half of the tumors of non-survivors (6/12) showed an aneuploid pattern (P = 0.004). Moreover, in the remaining six tumors of the non-survivors, two showed a third peak at 6C and one showed a higher S fraction. Therefore, only three showed a DNA diploid pattern that was indistinguishable from that of the survivors. These results suggest that flow cytometry is useful for estimating the prognosis of thyroid papillary carcinoma."

A DNA test for 13 HPV types that can cause cervical cancer is approved in the United States for co-screening with cytology of women >or=30 years old and for triage of women of all ages with equivocal cytology. However, most infections with HPV are benign. We evaluated trade-offs between specificity and sensitivity for approximately 40 HPV types in predicting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 and cancer in two prospective studies: a population-based screening study that followed 6196 women aged 30-94 years from Costa Rica for 7 years and a triage study that followed 3363 women aged 18-90 years with equivocal cytology in four U.S. centers for 2 years. For both screening and triage, testing for more than about 10 HPV types decreased specificity more than it increased sensitivity. The minimal increases in sensitivity and in negative predictive value achieved by adding HPV types to DNA tests must be weighed against the projected burden to thousands of women falsely labeled as being at high risk of cervical cancer."

We studied 401 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance liquid-based cervicovaginal cytology split samples for HPV by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) and by Hybrid Capture (HC) II (Digene, Gaithersburg, MD); 202 underwent HC II followed by CISH, and 199 underwent CISH followed by HC II. Of 401 vials, 101 (25.2%) were positive for HPV by 1 or more methods. HC II labeled 83 of 401 (20.7%) samples as positive, while 38 of 401 (9.5%) were positive by CISH. Positive attributes of CISH include the provision of a cytomorphologic link in assessing HPV positivity and comparative ease of use in laboratories without trained molecular diagnosticians. Greater efficacy and quantitative design are advantages of HC II. Comparing data by sequence of testing showed a lower likelihood of positive test results on the second ancillary test than on the first ancillary test, regardless of age or testing method (odds ratio, second/first = 0.58; P = .003). This finding suggests that liquid-based cervicovaginal cytology samples are not homogeneous throughout.

It is not clear how a specific immune response in cervical cancer patients is developed after radiotherapy. This study is an attempt to investigate the role of the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7-specific T helper response before and after radiotherapy. Lymphocytes were isolated from 32 cervical cancer patients before and after radiotherapy and from 16 healthy women. They were stimulated for 12 hr with autologous HPV-16 E7-pulsed monocyte-derived dendritic cells or directly with HPV-16 E7 synthetic peptides: E7(51-70), E7(65-84) and E7(79-98). The cells were stained for CD4, CD69, intracellular interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) cytokines and analysed by flow cytometry. A specific CD4(+) CD69(+) IFN-gamma(+) immune response against HPV-16 E7(79-98) peptide was observed in 10 of 14 patients (71.4%) after treatment, compared with 4 of 14 (28.5%) before radiotherapy (P = 0.039); however, this response was not associated with a successful clinical response. Before treatment, 5 of 31 patients showed a HPV-16 E7(79-98)-specific T helper type 2 (Th2) response. Interestingly, this response was significantly associated with a decrease in disease-free survival (P = 0.027). These results suggest that a Th2-type cellular response could be useful as a predictor of recurrence and poor prognosis. An increase of the HPV-specific immune response was observed after radiotherapy; however, it is not enough to control completely the disease after treatment. Our results support that the E7-specific T-cell IFN-gamma response in cervical cancer patients, rather than reflecting the host's capability of controlling tumour growth, might be an indicator for disease severity."

From 1980 to 1989, a cervico-vaginal infection from TV and HPV was diagnosed cytologically in 988 and 678 women, respectively. During the 181,240 person-years of observation, 440 cases of CIN III/cervical cancer developed. The age-adjusted incidence rates (IR) of CIN III were 225 per 100,000 person-years among women with no cytologic evidence of infection, 459 among women with TV infection, and 729 among women with HPV infection. A multiple regression model yielded a relative rate (RR) of CIN III of 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-3.4) among women with TV infection and 3.5 (CI = 1.9-6.6) among women with HPV infection, compared with women with neither infection. As CIN can be misclassified as HPV infection, the entry Pap-smears of 10 women with HPV infection who later developed CIN III were re-examined. Excluding the four discordant cases with the corresponding person-years decreased the RR of CIN III to 2.1 (CI = 0.9-4.8). Our report demonstrates the limitations of studies that rely only on cytologic detection of HPV infection. Nevertheless, the results support the hypothesis that HPV is a causal factor for CIN III lesions, and also display an association between TV infection and cervical neoplasia."

HPV-DNA was evaluated in 171 cases of cervical carcinoma treated from 1965 to 1990. In 110 cases, the analyses could be performed. A polymerase chain reaction technique was used on paraffin-embedded specimens obtained before the start of therapy. HPV-DNA of any type was detected in 78% (86/110) of all evaluable tumors. HPV16 was the predominant type and was detected in 56% (62/110), HPV18 in 8% (9/110), and HPV35 in 21% (23/110). Patients with tumors containing HPV16 or HPV18 were significantly (P = 0.011) younger than patients with tumors not containing either of these two subtypes. Vascular space invasion and lymph node metastases were observed more frequently in tumors expressing HPV16 and HPV18 (P = 0.002, P = 0.047) than in tumors negative for these HPV strains. Tumors containing HPV16 and HPV18 were significantly (P = 0.012) larger and more frequently (P = 0.005) associated with higher FIGO stages. The cancer-specific survival rate was lower for patients with HPV16- and HPV18-positive tumors, but the difference was not statistically significant. The microvessel density was a non-significant prognostic factor. The overall 5-year survival rate of the complete series was 91%. It was concluded that HPV-DNA was a prognostic factor in early-stage cervical cancer and was associated with the age of the patient, vascular space invasion, lymph node metastases, tumor size, and FIGO stage."

We reviewed the results published so far to compare the benefits and costs for participating women. At baseline screening, use of HPV testing increased the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2+. Detection of CIN3+ was significantly increased in two trials (relative risks [RRs] 1.70 and 2.26), but not in three other trials (RRs 1.03, 1.09 and 1.31). In three trials, seven extra women had a false-positive test for each extra detected CIN2+ case; although, in another trial, this number was 49 in women > or =35 years of age. The outcome of HPV testing versus cytological testing depends not only on the relative accuracy of the primary test but also on how radical the different triage procedures are. In two trials with published outcomes from the subsequent screening round, an approximately 50% reduction in CIN3+ detection was evident in the subsequent screening. However, in these two trials the screening modalities changed between the baseline and subsequent screening rounds, so these data do not show the effect of a switch from primary screening with cytological testing to primary screening with HPV testing."

A longitudinal 3-yr follow-up of nested-cohort subjects (n = 8825) from a population-based cervical cancer screening study whose Pap and HPV tests were negative at baseline were conducted. Every active HPV-negative (n = 413) participant had 12-mo follow-ups of Pap smear and HPV testing. Colposcopy was performed if either HPV-positive or cytology was abnormal. The cytology and histology information of the remaining subjects (passive HPV-negative, n = 8412) was obtained from national registry database. Median age of participants was 45 yr (range, 30-73 yr). The incidence of new acquisition was 4.2/100 woman-years. The 3-yr cumulative total HPV acquisition rate was 11.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.1-14.1). Increased number of sexual partners (> or =2 vs. 1) of the participant was associated with risk of acquisition (odds ratio [OR]: 5.0, 95% CI: 2.0-12.6) by multivariate analysis. Three cases of > or = cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 were identified in 3-yr follow-up in active HPV-negative subjects. HPV genotypes in the dysplastic tissue were actually present at baseline samples after reanalysis. From the passive HPV-negative group, only 1 case progressed to CIN2 probably after HPV acquisition.

In this study, we investigated p63 and p73 expression by immunocytochemistry using antibodies for TAp73 and p634A4 isoforms in 91 high-grade and 107 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 212 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 9 squamous cell carcinomas and 63 normal samples from an Asian screening population together with 47 hospital samples of carcinomas. There was significant correlation between the TAp73 and p634A4 indices (P<0.0001). Significantly, higher TAp73 and p634A4 indices were found in high-grade lesions or carcinoma when compared with atypical squamous cells and low-grade lesions (P<0.0001). Among atypical squamous cells, p634A4 indices of cases that subsequently progressed to low-grade (P=0.031) or high-grade lesions (P=0.006) were significantly higher than those that did not. For atypical squamous cells positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) as detected by Digene (61%), cases with high p634A4 index were still more likely to have subsequent high-grade lesions detected (P=0.016). Among low-grade lesions, significantly higher TAp73 (P=0.038) was found in cases that subsequently progressed to high-grade lesions. There was significant correlation between presence of high-risk HPV and p634A4 index (P=0.01). In summary, p63 and p73 immunocytochemistry are potential good markers for detection of carcinoma and high-grade lesions in cervical cytology samples and for triage management of women with atypical squamous cells and low-grade lesions."

In contrast, in the minority of women who have persistent infection, HSIL and invasive cancer are more likely to occur.

Patients with HNSCC from various parts of the world may have unique genotypes and this is the first genetic study of HNSCC in Sohag 500 KM to the south of Cairo. We performed a prospective study of 41 patients with precancerous and 79 patients with cancerous laryngeal, esophageal, nasopharyngeal, nasal and oral lesions, and 50 controls (The control patients were cases admitted for ear surgery or simple nasal surgery, from whom we took biopsy from mucosal lining of nasopharynx). The present study included 170 individuals who were admitted to the Ear, Nose and Throat department, Sohag University Hospital, Sohag, in Egypt in the period between April 2001 and March 2003. Samples which were taken by punch biopsy were frozen and stored at -80 degrees C and were subjected to histopathological examination. We investigated LOH and MSI by using six microsatellite markers located at chromosomes 3, 5, 9, and 17. The markers used were D3S1286, D9S171, D9S753, D17S654, D17S695, and CFS1-R. LOH was in all premalignant and malignant lesions at 5q33.3-q34 and 13% of Controls. LOH at 17p21 was absent in all premalignant lesions and was found in 53% of malignant lesions and 12.4% of Controls. In premalignant lesions, LOH was at 3pter-3p24.2 (73% of cases), at 9p21 (46%), at 9q21.1-22.3 (37%), and at 17p13 (37%). These percents increased in malignant lesions to 87, 80, 67, and 63%, respectively. They were 14, 19.4, 17, and 19% in controls. Examination of LOH could improve diagnosis, adds additional confidence, in HNSCC by DNA extraction from suspicious lesions in high-risk groups (smokers and alcoholics) and LOH at 3p/9p seems to be of particular value for early detection and definition of progression risk. If there are high percent of LOH at these chromosomes, active intervention should be done (chemoprevention and regular follow up head and neck examination for very early detection and management)."
CD008054,0,16597323,0,Human papillomavirus in cervical screening and vaccination.,"Recent decades have witnessed a reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer in countries where screening programmes have achieved broad coverage. The recognized importance of high-risk HPV (human papillomavirus) infection in the aetiology of cervical cancer may introduce a role for HPV DNA testing in cervical screening programmes. Positive HPV DNA tests indicate women at risk of cervical cancer with greater sensitivity, but reduced specificity, compared with exfoliative cytology. Combining HPV testing with cytology may be useful in the triage of minor cytological abnormalities into those requiring referral to colposcopy (HPV positive) compared with those who can be safely managed by cytological surveillance (HPV negative). With its high sensitivity and high-negative-predictive value, HPV testing may also be useful for predicting treatment failure, since residual disease is very unlikely in the event of a negative HPV test. Ultimately, prevention is better than cure, and the advent of HPV prophylactic vaccines may obviate the need for population-based cervical screening programmes in the future. A multivalent vaccine administered to adolescents prior to the onset of sexual activity and boosted at regular intervals throughout their sexually active life may provide protection against type-specific HPV infection, malignant precursors and invasive cervical disease. Several large randomized placebo-controlled trials have been conducted with promising results. For those generations of women already exposed to high-risk HPV infection, therapeutic vaccines may offer advantages over conventional treatment, although much work still needs to be done."
CD008054,0,15511816,0,Semiquantitative analysis of human papillomavirus DNA in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia by a differential polymerase chain reaction.,"A differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which takes account of both the human papillomavirus (HPV) type and the amount of viral DNA, was applied to 100 cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) in order to improve the characterisation of the lesions. One hundred women with cytological smears suggestive of CIN I-III and a colposcopically guided punch biopsy were studied. DNA was phenol-extracted and a consensus PCR with L1 primers and a type-specific PCR for HPV-16 and-18 E6 were performed in parallel. The different sensitivity of the PCR methods allowed a semiquantitative analysis of viral DNA. HPV analysis was possible in all 100 very small cervical punch biopsies. Of the lesions 79% were HPVpositive. The percentage of HPV-16-positive lesions increased significantly (P < 0.001) with the degree of severity of CIN (CIN I: 46%, CIN II: 63%, CIN III: 85%). The percentage of CIN with a high viral load increased also with the grade of CIN (CIN I: 8%, CIN II: 33%, CIN III: 44%). Cytologically positive lesions (Pap IIID or IVa) had significantly more frequently (p < 0.02) a high viral load: 39% vs. 10% of cytologically false negative lesions. In conclusion, type-specific PCR had a very high sensitivity in the detection of HPV-DNA also in cytologically false negative CIN. The addition of the less sensitive consensusPCR allowed a semiquantitative analysis of the viral copy number. The higher amount of viral DNA in cytologically positive lesions, which may correspond to a higher rate of proliferation, reflects a possible role of the viral load in the progression of CIN. In clinical practice, differential HPVPCR could help to improve the management of CIN."

The value of a PCR-based test for high-risk HPV types was studied in a cohort of 1622 women presenting in a routine triannual population-based screening programme. Women were included in the study when they had no previous history of cervical dysplasia; and their initial Pap smear was read as normal (Pap 1 or 2). The mean age of the women was 42 years (range 34-54 years) and mean follow-up time was 40 months (range 5-73 months). Women were referred for colposcopically directed biopsies if they had had 2 successive cervical smears read as Pap 3a (mild to moderate dyskaryosis) or one read as > or = Pap 3b (severe dyskaryosis). Women with histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (CIN III) were considered positive cases. All women were tested for 14 high-risk HPV genotypes. Of the 86 high-risk HPV-positive women, 6 developed CIN III, whereas only 1 of the 1536 HPV-negative women did. The women with normal Pap smears containing high-risk HPV genotypes were 116 times (95% CI, 13-990) more at risk of developing CIN III, in contrast to women without high-risk HPV. These results support the view that the interval between successive smears in cervical-cancer screening can be increased considerably for women with cytomorphologically normal and high-risk HPV-negative cervical smears as determined by PCR."

HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) seems to be rapidly increasing in incidence in many countries, including the USA, Sweden and Greece, and is known to affect younger patients who are less likely to have been exposed to the carcinogenic effects of tobacco and alcohol than their HPV-negative counterparts. There is accumulating evidence from prospective studies that HPV-positive OPC responds better to treatment, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, than HPV-negative OPC, and that patients with HPV-positive disease have excellent long-term survival rates. To date, patients with HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPC are managed according to common treatment protocols; this may no longer be appropriate in an age when the delivery of targeted treatment, tailored to individual tumour and patient characteristics, is becoming a reality. This review summarises our current understanding of HPV-positive OPC, drawing parallels from the role of HPV in the development of cervical cancer.

HPV is a member of the Papovaviridae family and until now over 100 types have been recognized There are two types of viral infection: latent and productive. Virus induced oncogenesis is the result of interaction between virus oncoproteins E6 and E7 and tumor supresor host genes p53 and Rb. Many cofactors such as immunosuppression, early sexual relationship, multiple sexual partners, other sexualy transsmited infections and smoking are contributing factors of the precancerous and invasive cervical lesions. According to the oncogenic potential HPV are divided into three groups: low, intermediate and high oncogenic risk viruses. Molecular technics which are used for the virus detection are: In situ hibridisation, Hyybrid capture test and polymerasa chain reaction.

There were 572 cases of cancer which is slightly more than would be expected on the basis of the national average cancer incidence in Finland. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was 1.14 and 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.05-1.24. There was a statistically significant excess of cancers of the vulva (SIR: 6.15, 95% CI: 3.18-10.7), vagina (SIR: 9.08, 95% CI: 2.95-21.2), cervical cancer (SIR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.07-2.53) and precancerous high-grade lesion of the uterine cervix (SIR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.10-1.50). The SIR for smoking-related cancers combined, excluding cervical cancer, was 1.45 (95% CI: 1.12-1.86). The differences in cancer risk between treatment modalities were minor. Delivery after the CIN surgery did not decrease the overall cancer risk. In conclusion, women previously treated for CIN have an increased long-term risk of cancers related to human papillomavirus (HPV) and smoking."
CD008054,0,10822879,0,[Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid: diagnosis and therapy].,"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) originates in the thyroid C cells, or parafollicular cells, secreting calcitonin. It may be either sporadic or familial. Familial form can be isolated or expression of a multiple endocrine neoplasia type II. Mutations of the RET proto-oncogene have been identified in the germline DNA of patients with familial MTC syndromes. Genetic testing can identify patients affected by multiple endocrine neoplasia and familial MTC, allowing early diagnosis and possible cure. The initial treatment is surgical and the adequate surgery consists of total thyroidectomy. The treatment of occult or minimal disease can be curative. Plasma calcitonin measurements are excellent markers for post-operative follow-up. Imaging study can help to discover recurrent or metastatic disease. Adjunctive therapy includes radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is reserved for bone metastases or for non resectable neck recurrences. Chemotherapy is reserved for patients with progressive MTC. Many chemotherapeutic regimens have been tried, results are controversial."
CD008054,0,19780421,0,[The role of colposcopy and typization of human papillomavirus in further diagnostic proceedings in patients with ASC-US cytological finding of the uterine cervix].,Bethesda system of classification of cytological findings was introduced in 2001 two subcategories in the category of atypical squamous cells (ASC) findings: ASC of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and ASC which cannot exlude high-grade intraepithelial lesions (ASC-H). The aim of our study was to assess a possible association of these two subcategories with pathologic biopsy finding and to find out the best further diagnostic proceedings.
CD008054,0,10219577,0,Humoral immune response against proteins E6 and E7 in cervical carcinoma patients positive for human papilloma virus type 16 during treatment and follow-up.,"To investigate the humoral immune response to transforming proteins E6 and E7 of human papillomavirus type 16 before and after treatment and during follow-up, consecutive serum samples from 36 cervical cancer patients whose tumours were found to contain human papillomavirus type 16 DNA by use of the polymerase chain reaction were tested using in vitro translated proteins E6 and E7 in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay and in an E7 synthetic peptide enzyme immunoassay. Antibody levels against E6 and E7 as measured by radioimmunoprecipitation assay showed a nearly identical pattern. Seronegative patients remained seronegative throughout treatment and follow-up. Seropositive patients showed either a decrease in antibody level or stable antibody levels during treatment. In contrast to patients without evidence of disease at the end of the study, the majority of patients with recurrent disease showed increasing antibody levels during the follow-up period. These results indicate that, in patients who are seropositive before treatment antibody levels against E6 and E7 of human papillomavirus type 16 after treatment are closely linked to treatment response. The use of the more sensitive radioimmunoprecipitation assay did not lead to a better correlation of antibody levels with clinical disease status of the patients than the use of the enzyme immunoassay."
CD008054,0,20957631,0,A comparison of human papillomavirus testing of clinician-collected and self-collected samples during follow-up after screen-and-treat.,"Screen-and-treat cervical cancer prevention programs based on high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and cryotherapy have been shown to be effective in resource-limited settings. However, because cryotherapy is not 100% effective, follow-up is needed after treatment to detect post-treatment failures. We compared the test performances of high-risk HPV testing (Hybrid Capture 2) using self-collected and clinician-collected samples as well as cervical cytology for identifying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 or 3 or invasive cervical cancer (CIN2+) among women who did (n=812) and did not (n=1858) undergo cryotherapy in a South African screen-and-treat trial. At 6 months after enrolment (and after cryotherapy, if performed), women were tested using all three screening methods and then underwent colposcopy/biopsy. A predefined subset of women (n=1,455) had extended follow-up with colposcopy/biopsy at 12 months. A total of 33 and 91 cases of CIN2+ were detected among treated and untreated women, respectively. The sensitivity of HPV testing using clinician-collected samples and cervical cytology did not differ by treatment status. HPV testing of clinician-collected samples detected the most cases of CIN2+ among both treated (85%) and untreated (91%) women (p=0.31). Cytology (at a cutoff of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or greater) detected 76% of cases among both treated and untreated women. However, the sensitivity of HPV testing using self-collected samples was significantly lower among treated versus untreated women (55% vs. 78%, p=0.01). HPV testing using self-collected vaginal specimens may be useful in primary screening but performs poorly for detecting post-treatment failures."
CD008054,0,18159987,0,Use of lay health workers in a community-based chronic disease control program.,"The increasing burden of non-communicable diseases in the developing world, and in particular diabetes, cancer and circulatory diseases, is an unfortunate fact of life. At the same time infection-related diseases, including sexually transmitted HIV-AIDS and HPV-dependent cervical cancer, remain important. One approach to alleviating the resultant stress on national health provision is to expand the knowledge base at the community level with contributions by lay health workers (LHWs). Here we take a brief look at the available literature and propose a model for intervention incorporating two way dialogue with the general populace to find effective means to package expertise in the medical/research community for lay consumption. Our argument is that particular attention should be paid to socioeconomic and behavioural aspects and to disease surveillance at the local level in order to be able to accurately assess the impact of interventions. For this purpose, we need to marshal volunteers from within communities taking account of their problems and motivations. Included are provision of assistance in setting up physical exercise programs, quit tobacco campaigns, alcohol awareness programs, running disease screening exercises and general help by providing advice as to risk and protective factors and clinical treatments, with an special focus on palliative care."
CD008054,0,19378324,0,Mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors in head and neck cancer.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase that activates multiple signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/v-AKT murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog protein (Akt), has long been a target of novel therapies. Despite universal EGFR expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the majority of patients do not respond to EGFR inhibitors. This review focuses on mechanisms of resistance to these agents in HNSCC, and how these may be unique when compared with other malignancies such as non-small cell lung and colorectal cancers. Published studies and abstracts reveal that there are likely several mechanisms underlying resistance, suggesting that different strategies will be required to improve efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in HNSCC."
CD008054,0,12749760,0,"INGN 201: Ad-p53, Ad5CMV-p53, Adenoviral p53, INGN 101, p53 gene therapy--Introgen, RPR/INGN 201.","Introgen's adenoviral p53 gene therapy [INGN 201, ADVEXIN] is in clinical development for the treatment of various cancers. The p53 tumour suppressor gene is deleted or mutated in many tumour cells and is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human tumours. INGN 201 has been shown to kill cancer cells directly. In August 2002, Introgen announced plans to file an application for INGN 201 with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) for the treatment of head and neck cancer; the European filing will be submitted simultaneously with the previously scheduled (planned for 2004) submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for ADVEXIN to the US FDA. On 20 February 2003, INGN 201 received orphan drug designation from the US FDA for head and neck cancer. INGN 201 is available for licensing although Introgen favours retaining partial or full rights to the therapy in the US. Introgen Therapeutics and its collaborative partner for the p53 programme, Aventis Gencell, have been developing p53 gene therapy products. The agreement was originally signed by RhÃ´ne-Poulenc Rorer's Gencell division, which became Aventis Gencell after RhÃ´ne-Poulenc Rorer merged with Hoechst Marion Roussel to form Aventis Pharma. According to the original agreement, Introgen was responsible for phase I and preclinical development in North America, while Aventis Gencell was responsible for clinical trials conducted in Europe and for clinical trials in North America beyond phase I. In April 2001, Aventis Gencell and Introgen restructured their existing collaboration agreement for p53 gene therapy products. Aventis Gencell indicated that p53 research had suffered from internal competition for resources and was pulling back from its development agreement with Introgen for p53 gene therapy products. Introgen will assume responsibility for worldwide development of all p53 programmes and will obtain exclusive worldwide commercial rights to p53-based gene therapy products. Aventis Gencell will increase its equity stake in Introgen by investing $US 20 million in non-voting preferred shares of Introgen that will be convertible to Introgen common shares at a premium to the market price. Introgen will also receive a 5% equity stake in Aventis Gencell. Introgen intends to use the proceeds of Aventis Gencell's investment to fund the commercialisation of the p53 gene therapy product and to begin building its internal sales and marketing division to support the products anticipated market introduction. In April 2001, Aventis Pharma announced that it intended to spin off its gene therapy division, Aventis Gencell, as a separate operating company. In mid-2002, Aventis Pharma was still attempting to spin off Aventis Gencell but negotiations with venture capital partners had failed. Gene Logic (formerly OncorMed) of the US was contracted by Introgen to perform the p53 status testing for RPR/INGN 201 phase I clinical trials. In February 2003, Introgen announced it will streamline its phase III clinical trials for head and neck cancer to reduce spending, and that INGN 201 received Orphan Drug Status for head and neck cancer in the US. According to results (published in January 2003) of Introgen's phase II study of non-metastatic patients with non-small cell lung cancer (ineligible to receive surgery or combination therapy with radiation and cancer chemotherapy) treated with INGN 201 combined with radiation therapy, approximately 60% of patients' primary tumours regressed or disappeared after the combination therapy, as assessed by both biopsies and by CT scans 3 months after treatment. Investigators commented that further randomised trials are needed to follow-up on these observations. In February 2003, Introgen announced that it will move ahead with the development of registration plans for a non-small cell lung cancer indication for INGN 201, and is now including support for lung cancer registration in partnering discussions. RPR/INGN 201 is undergoing phase I trials for the potential treatment of lung, breast, ovarian, bladder, liver and brain cancers. Introgen and Aventis Pharma had signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute (NCI). NCI will sponsor clinical trials to evaluate and develop RPR/INGN 201 as a potential anticancer agent for these cancer indications. The trials conducted under a NCI-sponsored IND will evaluate RPR/INGN 201 alone and in combination with other anticancer agents. This agreement was originally signed by RhÃ´ne-Poulenc Rorer's Gencell. Introgen has completed three phase I clinical trials with INGN 201 in patients with bronchioalveolar cell lung carcinoma, ovarian cancer and recurrent glioblastomas, respectively. Intratumoural injection of RPR/INGN 201 in patients with recurrent glioblastomas was well tolerated and resulted in expression of the p53 protein. Direct administration of RPR/INGN 201 to the lower airways of patients with bronchioalveolar cell lung carcinoma resulted in symptomatic improvement and improved lung function in some patients. In February 2003, Introgen announced that the US Patent and Trademark Office has issued to The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, patent No. 6,511,847 entitled ""Recombinant p53 Adenovirus Methods and Compositions"". Introgen Therapeutics is the exclusive licensee of this patent. The patent covers any adenoviral DNA molecules that encode the p53 gene positioned under the control of a promoter. Such a DNA molecule forms the genetic core of Introgen's ADVEXIN cancer therapy. Introgen's ADVEXIN therapy is now covered by up to ten separate US patents relevant to the product including compositions, therapeutic methods of administering the product in virtually any form, alone and in conjunction with the most widely used chemotherapeutic and radiation treatments, as well as its production. Introgen has a number of US patents that relate to the clinical use of ADVEXIN in cancer as monotherapy or in combination with one or more chemotherapeutic drugs, radiation therapies, or other agents that have a damaging effect on the DNA or survival of (i.e. 2-methoxyestradiol, patent No. 6,410,029) cancer cells. In July 2002, the US Patent and Trademark Office issued to The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System US patent No. 6,410,010. The patent broadly covers all adenoviral p53 compositions (including ADVEXIN), therapeutic and otherwise, that express adequate p53 in amounts sufficient to suppress the growth of or kill cancer cells in patients. The patent also covers adenoviral p53 that incorporates a specific type of promoter that helps cells to express the p53 tumour suppressor gene. Introgen is the exclusive licensee of this composition of matter patent covering ADVEXIN. In December 2002, Aventis Pharmaceuticals was issued US patent No. 6,262,032 B1 entitled ""Method of Destroying Hyperproliferative Cells by Combining p53 and Taxoid Treatment"". Introgen has an exclusive license to this patent and is using this type of combination therapy in its breast cancer trial. Introgen expects to realise $US 2.5-3 million from sales of INGN 201."

CD008054,0,8544594,0,Flow cytometric analysis of primary and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx.,"A retrospective analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from patients with histologically confirmed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma was performed using flow cytometry. Ninety-eight sets of specimens from previously untreated patients with an oral cavity or oropharyngeal tumor and a simultaneous cervical metastatic deposit were analyzed. Normal mucosa and cervical lymph nodes were processed identically and run as controls. All patients underwent surgical resection at Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center or The Eye and Ear Hospital of Pittsburgh between 1980 and 1986. The specimens from 94 patients were technically adequate for interpretation. Diploid histograms in both the primary and metastatic tumors were present in 49 (52%) of 94 patients. Aneuploid histograms in either the primary and metastatic tumors were noted in 45 (47%) of 94 patients. In this group of 45 patients, the primary tumor and cervical metastasis were both aneuploid in 21 (46%), and aneuploid histograms occurred with equal incidence in either the primary or metastasis in the remaining 24 cases. No statistically significant prediction of survival could be made from any correlation with the histograms of either the primary or metastasis. The potential technical problems and limitations of flow cytometry in the determination of DNA content of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and the selection of patients with advanced disease warrant caution in the interpretation of results."
CD008054,0,1312856,0,Genital human papillomavirus infections in adolescents: implications for evaluation and management.,"Genital infections caused by human papillomaviruses (HPV) have become the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the United States. Rates of infection with these agents are particularly high among adolescents. The most common clinical expression of genital HPV infection is condyloma acuminata, a condition that dermatologists are frequently called on to treat. The identification of external genital warts in a teenager raises questions that impact directly on the patient's evaluation and management. Issues of importance include the likelihood that occult infection exists at other sites in the genital tract, the risks associated with HPV infection, and the need, if any, for further diagnostic assessment, including that necessary to detect the presence of coexisting sexually transmitted infections. This article examines these and associated issues and provides information that will be of value to the dermatologist caring for adolescent patients with genital warts."

DNA extracted from pretreatment plasma of 50 cervical cancer patients and from serial longitudinal plasma of 21 patients was quantified for HPV16/HPV18 by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Another 15 patients with low-grade lesion (LG), 18 patients with high-grade lesion (HG), and 96 normal individuals were studied as controls. Plasma HPV16-DNA was detectable in 50% of cancer patients. The incidence and median level were statistically higher than those in LG patients and normal, but similar to HG patients. Plasma HPV18-DNA was only detected in 6% of cancer patients and 1% of normal. Same type of HPV present in plasma was also detected in its primary tumor; and the level of plasma HPV16-DNA was dependent on the viral load in primary tumor. Plasma HPV-DNA was not detected in 16 of 21 patients after treatment, and those patients had complete response to therapy. HPV-DNA persisted or reappeared in five patients after treatment (one had persistent disease and another had recurrence). Plasma HPV-DNA might be a valuable marker for monitoring therapeutic response and disease progression in cervical cancer."

Three specimens from the buccal mucosa and lateral border of tongue were collected from each subject by using cervical brushes and brooms. The brush was immersed in a preservative fluid. The sample in the preservative fluid was processed according to the manufacturer's directions (SurePath, UK). Slides were stained by the Papanicolaou method and assessed for squamous cell adequacy by the same criteria used for cervical cytology screening. Immunocytochemical staining for FHIT (Fragile Histidine Triad) was applied in liquid-based preparations following the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase method. Human papillomavirus (HPV) detection was performed using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay (Digene) and the PCR-based Roche AMPLICOR HPV Test. LBC preparation slides showed good sample preservation, specimen adequacy and visualization of cell morphology. Interestingly, nine cases showed borderline cytological abnormalities from apparently normal oral mucosa. All cases showed good quality positive FHIT immunoreactivity staining. All studied cases were high-risk HPV negative using HC2 assay method. However, the AMPLICOR Roche Test detected four samples with positive results for high-risk HPVs. Liquid-based cytology has potential as a screening tool for oral cancer and precancer. The method may also have applications for research and practice in the field of oral cancer and precancer. However a special custom-designed oral cytobrush is required."
CD008054,0,17367324,0,p16(INK4a) Expression does not predict the outcome of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2.,"Spontaneous regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) lesions has been recognized since 1955, but predictors of this are poorly understood. Among the predictive markers studied, p16(INK4a) has been suggested to be of some value in monitoring the diagnosis of CIN2. In this clinical trial, 90 Brazilian women, diagnosed to CIN2 and high-risk human papillomavirus infection, were randomized into two groups of equal size: 45 women whose lesions were excised and 45 women subjected to prospective follow-up at 3-month intervals at least for 1 year (mean 6.8 months). p16(INK4a) expression was analyzed in paraffin-embedded sections using immunohistochemical staining. Among the 45 women in the follow-up group, 42% experienced spontaneous regression, 11% showed persistence, 22% progressed to CIN3, and 20% had partial regression to CIN1 or ASCUS (atypical squamous cell undetermined signifiance). p16(INK4a) expression was detected in 68.9% of the patients. In univariate survival (Cox) analysis, no significant difference in regression was obtained between p16(INK4a)-negative and -positive CIN2 lesions (adjusted HR = 1.1; 95% CI 0.6-2.0). In conclusion, p16(INK4a) expression could be useful in the diagnosis of CIN2. However, it failed to predict the outcome of CIN2. Because of its high spontaneous regression rate, follow-up could be considered as a management option of CIN2 in young and compliant women."
